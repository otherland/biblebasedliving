We blame our circumstances, family, friends, and sometimes even God, for our troubles. Yet Satan is a master deceiver who instigates problems and disappears before anyone recognizes his influence.\n\nThe Bible instructs us in Ephesians 6:10 that \u201cour struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the powers of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms\u201d. If we recognize the signs of a spiritual attack, we won\u2019t waste time blaming the wrong people\u2014instead we focus on dealing with the devil and overcoming him. What are the 7 signs that you are dealing with a spiritual attack?\n\nSign #1) When you struggle with random thoughts that go against biblical teachings\n\nIf we haven\u2019t learned to discipline our minds according to God\u2019s word, our thoughts can wander to the wrong places. Yet even with discipline, it\u2019s possible to find ourselves struggling with adverse thoughts. We must first recognize that sinful, evil thoughts don\u2019t come from God and likely are planted by the evil one. Our responsibility is to deal with those thoughts promptly. One of the best scriptures to memorize and use against this attack is 2 Corinthians 10:4-5.\n\nSign #2) When you struggle with overwhelming feelings of discouragement\n\nWe are often tossed to and fro through the waves of adversity. Many times we pray, fast, and study God\u2019s word to find peace in the midst of it. Yet sometimes we have moments when we feel overwhelmingly discouraged and without the strength to keep going. In those times we must call out to God to provide the grace we need to move forward. It\u2019s especially helpful to begin with thanking the Lord for His many blessings one by one as we make our way out of discouragement.\n\nSign #3) When you struggle in your relationships\n\nEven when we strive to live at peace with everyone, we may have to deal with people who cause division, distraction, and disputing in our lives. These could be family members, coworkers, or even fellow believers. Most of the time, they don\u2019t realize that they are being used by Satan to cause trouble. We overcome this struggle by praying for them and asking God for the wisdom to deal with them in a way that is pleasing to Him.\n\nSign #4) When you struggle with sleeping because of interruptions or nightmares\n\nWe are usually at our best when we are healthy and get rest at night. However Satan can cause us to be awaken with troubling dreams or interruptions throughout the evening. It\u2019s best to seek out the Lord in prayer especially using the Psalms as a method to get you through. Psalm 3:5 \u201cI will lay down and sleep; I wake again, because the Lord sustains me\u201d and Psalm 4:8 \u201cIn peace I will lie down and sleep, for you alone, Lord, make me dwell in safety\u201d are especially helpful.\n\nSign #5) When you struggle with past temptations that you\u2019ve overcome\n\nJust when you thought you were over a past temptation\u2014it comes back with a fierce determination to draw you back in. This tactic of our enemy is to make us forget our freedom from the power of sin. We must hold fast to our first love, Jesus Christ, and not make excuses for fading back into former ways of living. The Lord makes a way for us to escape if we are willing to trust Him according to 1 Corinthians 10:19.\n\nSign #6) When you struggle with worries, doubts, and fears every day\n\nWorry, doubt, and fear are always available if we let them infiltrate our hearts and minds. We live in a fallen world where there\u2019s an abundance of trouble to deal with. Yet our hearts and minds must stay completely focused on God\u2019s word and His faithfulness in spite of the hardships we face. An everyday fear, worry, or doubt needs regular treatment of God\u2019s word such as 2 Timothy 1:7, Philippians 4:4-8, and Matthew 21:21 for meditation and memorization.\n\nSign #7) When you struggle with praying regularly\n\nThere\u2019s nothing Satan wants more than for the people of God to stop praying with regularity. Our prayers hinder his work in the world. Many times we underestimate the power of prayer and begin to neglect the fervency and consistency of it. We must never forget the amazing works of God in our lives through prayer. Our prayers are powerful and effective to bring down the walls of deceit and lies built by our enemy.\n\nKnocked Down, but not Knocked Out\n\n\u201cLife is a hard fight, a struggle, a wrestling with the principle of evil, hand to hand, foot to foot. Every inch of the way is disputed.\u201d (Florence Nightingale)\n\nMany times we want out of the struggle. We want to give up and walk away\u2014hoping to find a calmer, more peaceful life. Yet the kingdom struggle remains until Jesus comes back. We must fight on like worthy and faithful soldiers of Christ. We were created for this moment of struggle so that the Lord would be glorified as we tear down Satan\u2019s kingdom winning over one person at a time. Fight on!\n\nRelated reading: The Sword of the Spirit\n\nResource \u2013 New International Version Bible, The Holy Bible, New International Version\u00ae, NIV\u00ae Copyright\u00a9 1973, 1978, 1984, 2011 by Biblca, Inc.\u2122 Used by permission.

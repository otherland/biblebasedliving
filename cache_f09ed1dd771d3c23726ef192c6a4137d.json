{"title": "8 Signs You're in a Spiritual Battle and How to Win", "text": "Fatigue. Anxiety. Stress. Temptation. Fear. Despair. Lies. Revenge. Sound familiar? These are some of the devil\u2019s favorite schemes for eroding our faith in God. He wants us to believe that we\u2019re stuck, that our situation is hopeless, that defeat is our destiny. If we\u2019re not careful, these deceptions set us on a slippery slope to spiritual defeat.\n\nSatan\u2019s Profile: The Father of Lies\n\nJohn Wesley wrote, \u201cAs the most dangerous winds may enter at little openings, so the devil never enters more dangerously than by little unobserved incidents, which seem to be nothing, yet insensibly open the heart to great temptations.\u201d1 The best way to wall off our heart from Satan\u2019s enticements is to know the Scriptures. They teach us how to withstand the enemy\u2019s ploys by giving us a glimpse of his character, tactics, and purpose. Here are a few descriptions of Satan from the Bible.\n\nMurderer . Jesus told a group of unbelieving Jews, \u201cYou are of your father the devil, and the desires of your father you want to do. He was a murderer from the beginning\u201d (John 8:44).\n\n. Jesus told a group of unbelieving Jews, \u201cYou are of your father the devil, and the desires of your father you want to do. He was a murderer from the beginning\u201d (John 8:44). Liar. Continuing in John 8:44, Jesus described Satan\u2019s deception: \u201c[The devil] does not stand in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaks a lie, he speaks from his own resources, for he is a liar and the father of it.\u201d\n\nContinuing in John 8:44, Jesus described Satan\u2019s deception: \u201c[The devil] does not stand in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaks a lie, he speaks from his own resources, for he is a liar and the father of it.\u201d Predator. According to 1 Peter 5:8: \u201cYour adversary the devil walks about like a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour.\u201d\n\nKnowing these facts about our enemy, why do we still fall into his traps? Often, we give in to distractions. Corrie ten Boom said, \u201cIf the devil cannot make us bad, he will make us busy.\u201d Satan creates all sorts of distractions to keep us from studying our Bibles, attending church, and praying. He will do anything to keep us from realizing that Jesus already defeated him at the cross (Colossians 2:15) and that we can overcome his schemes (Ephesians 6:11).\n\nSome struggles have physical solutions. We might reduce our fatigue by getting more rest or improve our spirits by enjoying the company of loved ones. But if we\u2019re not careful, Satan moves the battle to the spiritual realm. He waits for a moment of weakness and then tells us we\u2019re alone in the struggle. As worry fills our heart, we wonder how we will ever meet the deadline, restore that relationship, or pay all the bills. Fear and anxiety grow to the point that they seem like unavoidable realities.\n\nNothing could be further from the truth. We can be confident that \u201cHe who has begun a good work in [us] will complete it until the day of Jesus Christ\u201d (Philippians 1:6). Psalm 121 describes God as a helper, a keeper, and the preserver of our soul. \u201cHe will not allow your foot to be moved\u2026. The Lord shall preserve you from all evil; He shall preserve your soul. The Lord shall preserve your going out and your coming in from this time forth, and even forevermore\u201d (Psalm 121:3, 7-8). God never leaves us helpless.\n\nSatan\u2019s Playbook: 8 Spiritual Attacks\n\nIn addition to assurances of God\u2019s love and support, the Bible promises that God will equip us to overcome the enemy\u2019s schemes.\n\nFatigue.\n\nFor generations, the nation of Israel rebelled against God. Eventually, He withdrew His protection and allowed the Babylonians to carry them into exile. The people quickly lost heart. When they complained that God was no longer concerned about their welfare, He sent a prophet named Isaiah to assure them. Isaiah asked the people, \u201cWhy do you say, O Jacob, and speak, O Israel: \u2018My way is hidden from the Lord, and my just claim is passed over by my God?\u2019 Have you not known? Have you not heard? The everlasting God, the Lord, the Creator of the ends of the earth, neither faints nor is weary. His understanding is unsearchable. He gives power to the weak, and to those who have no might He increases strength\u201d (Isaiah 40:27-29).\n\nHave you lost heart? Do you feel as if God has forgotten you? Rest assured, when you are at the end of your rope, God is just getting started. Just as He delivered Israel from Babylon, Almighty God will give you strength to endure your trials.\n\nAnxiety.\n\nProverbs 12:25 says, \u201cAnxiety in the heart of man causes depression, but a good word makes it glad.\u201d The apostle Peter offered a good word just before the verse that describes Satan as a prowling lion. He said, \u201cHumble yourselves under the mighty hand of God, that He may exalt you in due time, casting all your care upon Him, for He cares for you\u201d (1 Peter 5:6-7).\n\nWhat is the key to living in God\u2019s presence? Humility. When we understand that we are powerless to face Satan in our own strength, we begin to grasp the depth of our need for God. And if we are feeling overburdened, there is an excellent chance we are hanging on to responsibilities that aren\u2019t ours to bear. They belong to God.\n\nStress.\n\nThe Bible does not mention stress, but it has plenty to say about stressful situations. King David was someone who faced many trials. He fought wild animals, a giant, and a king as a young man. Later in life, his own son attempted to assassinate him. Although God did not remove the stressful situations from David\u2019s life, He sustained David through them. And Scripture promises that God will do the same for us. In Psalm 55:22, David wrote, \u201cCast your burden on the Lord, and He shall sustain you; He shall never permit the righteous to be moved.\u201d\n\nOur part in the matter is to trust God\u2019s promises and rely on His loving kindness. When Satan attacks, may we join King David in saying, \u201cThe Lord is my strength and my shield; my heart trusted in Him, and I am helped; therefore my heart greatly rejoices, and with my song I will praise Him\u201d (Psalm 28:7).\n\nTemptation.\n\nSuccess often presents a greater danger than trouble. When things are going well, Satan encourages us to trust our abilities rather than relying on God. Proverbs 16:18 says, \u201cPride goes before destruction, and a haughty spirit before a fall.\u201d It is the oldest play in the enemy\u2019s book. He convinced Eve to eat forbidden fruit by telling her it would open her eyes, and she would \u201cbe like God, knowing good and evil\u201d (Genesis 3:5). Our weaknesses may be different from Eve\u2019s, but the tactic is the same: Satan appeals to our desires.\n\nFor this reason, Paul warns, \u201cLet him who thinks he stands take heed lest he fall. No temptation has overtaken you except such as is common to man; but God is faithful, who will not allow you to be tempted beyond what you are able, but with the temptation will also make the way of escape, that you may be able to bear it\u201d (1 Corinthians 10:12-14). With a humble heart and God\u2019s guidance, we can withstand temptation.\n\nFear.\n\nThe only thing we have to fear is\u2026 God. Wars cannot be won without bravery, but President Roosevelt\u2019s famous speech overlooked a crucial factor. Jesus instructed His disciples not to \u201cfear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. But rather fear Him who is able to destroy both soul and body in hell\u201d (Matthew 10:28).\n\nThe disciples had more reason to be afraid than most. Those complicit in Jesus\u2019 death actively hunted down His followers. How could Jesus expect them not to be frightened? Because He also said, \u201cI will never leave you nor forsake you\u201d (Hebrews 13:5). Their greatest adversaries were no match for the King of kings and Lord of lords. This truth gave them the courage to respond, \u201cThe Lord is my helper; I will not fear. What can man do to me?\u201d (Hebrews 13:6)\n\nIf you feel overwhelmed, shift your focus from the problem to the solution. In the midst of your struggle, Jesus is standing beside you. He will never abandon you, and nothing is impossible for Him (Mark 10:27).\n\nDespair.\n\nWhen Paul wrote his second letter to the Corinthian church, he had endured five lashings, three beatings, a stoning, three shipwrecks, frequent imprisonments, and more (2 Corinthians 11:23-27). To make matters worse, false teachers in the church were slandering him and questioning his credentials as an apostle. Under such pressure, many believers would have doubted their calling or God\u2019s goodness. But Paul did not waver. He explained, \u201cWe are hard-pressed on every side, yet not crushed; we are perplexed, but not in despair; persecuted, but not forsaken; struck down, but not destroyed\u201d (2 Corinthians 4:8-9, emphasis added).\n\nBecoming a Christian does not mean our trouble ends. As Paul testified, it often intensifies. Even so, faith assures us of ultimate victory in the form of eternal salvation through Christ Jesus. We may not see the purpose behind our pain, but we can trust the Lord to shine through our brokenness. His grace is sufficient, and His \u201cstrength is made perfect in weakness\u201d (2 Corinthians 12:9).\n\nLies.\n\nLuke 4 records one of the most vivid accounts of spiritual warfare anywhere in Scripture. While Jesus was fasting in the wilderness, Satan tempted him three times. There are many rich lessons we can draw from this passage, but let\u2019s focus on the third temptation in verses 9-12:\n\nThen he [Satan] brought Him [Jesus] to Jerusalem, set Him on the pinnacle of the temple, and said to Him, \u201cIf You are the Son of God, throw Yourself down from here. For it is written: \u2018He shall give His angels charge over you, to keep you,\u2019 and, \u2018In their hands they shall bear you up, lest you dash your foot against a stone.\u2019\u201d\n\nAnd Jesus answered and said to him, \u201cIt has been said, \u2018You shall not tempt the Lord your God.\u2019\u201d\n\nSatan\u2019s attack began with an assault on Jesus\u2019 identity as the Son of God. From there, he tried to erode Jesus\u2019 dependence on God. And did you catch what he did next? Satan tempted Jesus to sin by quoting Scripture (Psalm 91:11-12). While his recitation was accurate, his application was not. Instead of fabricating an out-and-out lie, Satan attacked Jesus\u2019 relationship with the Father and distorted biblical truth.\n\nWe don\u2019t have to look far to find this tactic at work in our world today. Many sincere Christians have wandered from sound doctrine by accepting partial truths and doubting their relationship with God. Our best hope for resisting Satan is to respond as Jesus did and anchor our thoughts in Scripture. In the words of the apostle Paul, \u201cWe use God\u2019s mighty weapons, not worldly weapons, to knock down the strongholds of human reasoning and to destroy false arguments\u201d (2 Corinthians 10:4, NLT).\n\nEphesians 6:14 commands us, \u201cStand therefore, having girded your waist with truth.\u201d Earlier, Paul wrote that \u201cthe truth is in Jesus\u201d (Ephesians 4:21). The truth we stand on\u2014the truth of who God is, what Jesus did for us, and who we are in Christ Jesus\u2014is meant to permeate everything we do. In the battle for our minds, we can refute Satan\u2019s lies.\n\nRevenge.\n\nHave you ever watched a movie or a play in which a character seemed to be getting away with such a grave injustice that you could hardly wait for the offender to get his due? Travesties of justice stir the emotions. They create momentary, knee-jerk reactions that stoke our longing for revenge.\n\nThe biblical writers were not immune to this struggle. Throughout the psalms, David cried out to God against injustice. On one occasion, he said, \u201cArise, O Lord, confront him, cast him down; deliver my life from the wicked with Your sword\u201d (Psalm 17:13). In other words, \u201cGod, take him out!\u201d But David was far from blameless. When he fell for Bathsheba, David sent her husband\u2014one of his most faithful soldiers\u2014to certain death (2 Samuel 11:15, 17).\n\nReceive Daily Devotions from David Jeremiah Sign up to receive email devotions each day!

As you might imagine, Nathan was reluctant to rebuke his king, so he started the conversation with a parable about a rich man who mistreated a poor man (2 Samuel 12:1-4). Not realizing he was the rich man, David became incensed and said, \u201cAs the Lord lives, the man who has done this shall surely die! And he shall restore fourfold for the lamb, because he did this thing and because he had no pity\u201d (2 Samuel 12:5-6).\n\nDavid\u2019s response teaches us something about our desire for vengeance: We deal much more severely with others than we would deal with ourselves. Like many of Satan\u2019s other schemes, longing for revenge begins with righteous intentions\u2014we don\u2019t want to see abuses of power or stand by as innocent people get hurt. The danger comes when we attempt to stand in God\u2019s place and exact vengeance on our own terms. Scripture says, \u201cBeloved, do not avenge yourselves, but rather give place to wrath; for it is written, \u2018Vengeance is Mine, I will repay,\u2019 says the Lord\u201d (Romans 12:19).\n\nOur Protection: The Truth of Scripture\n\nWhen spiritual battles mount, Scripture is our first line of defense. It contains the mind of Christ between two covers. John\u2019s Gospel says, \u201cAnd the Word [Jesus] became flesh and dwelt among us, and we beheld His glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth\u201d (John 1:14). Later, Jesus told His disciples, \u201cI am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through Me\u201d (John 14:6).\n\nBy standing squarely on the truth of who God is and who we are in Christ, we can resist the enemy\u2019s attacks. Christ Jesus has already claimed victory, and He will not leave us defenseless. In the words of 2 Peter 2:9, \u201cThe Lord knows how to deliver the godly out of temptations.\u201d When we walk in Truth, we gain the power to overcome deceptions like fatigue, anxiety, stress, temptation, fear, despair, lies, and revenge.\n\nSources:\n\n1 John Wesley, A Plain Account of Christian Perfection, (Kansas City, MO: Beacon Hill Press of Kansas City, 1966), 110.\n\nContinue your study of spiritual warfare with these other articles by David Jeremiah:"}

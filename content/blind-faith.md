## Blind Faith: Understanding True Faith in God

Faith is a concept that holds great significance in Christianity. It is often associated with the idea of "blind faith," which refers to belief without true understanding or discrimination. However, is this the kind of faith that God desires us to have? Does God expect us to have a blind faith? To answer these questions, we will explore the topic of blind faith in the context of biblical teachings and examples.

### The Example of Abraham's Faith

One of the most prominent examples of faith in the Old Testament is that of Abraham. God made a promise to Abraham that he would become the father of many nations, even though he and his wife Sarah were very old. In their old age, Sarah miraculously gave birth to their son Isaac. Then, God asked Abraham to offer Isaac as a sacrifice ([Genesis 22:1-19](https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/22/Genesis-22-1.html)). Astonishingly, Abraham obeyed without questioning God's command. This incident might suggest that God commends blind faith.

However, if we delve deeper into the biblical account, we find a different perspective on Abraham's faith. In the book of Hebrews, Abraham's faith is described as a reasoned faith. Hebrews 11, often referred to as the hall of fame of faith, mentions Abraham multiple times. In verses 18-19, it states that Abraham "reasoned" that God had promised a great nation through Isaac and believed that even if Isaac were killed, God could raise him from the dead. Abraham's actions were not blind; they were based on reasoning and understanding.

### The Importance of Reason and Understanding

Throughout Scripture, reason, wisdom, and logic are emphasized as valuable traits. [Proverbs 3:13](https://www.bibleref.com/Proverbs/3/Proverbs-3-13.html) tells us that we are blessed when we gain knowledge and understanding. [Hebrews 5:12-14](https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/5/Hebrews-5-12.html) reproves those who do not seek growth in understanding. The Bereans in [Acts 17:11](https://www.bibleref.com/Acts/17/Acts-17-11.html) were commended for their diligent search of the Scriptures to verify the truth of Paul's teachings. The apostle Paul himself often used reason and logical arguments to persuade others of the truth.

God has given us the ability to think and reason, and He expects us to use this gift. The goal of reason and logic is to find truth, and Jesus, who claimed to be the truth ([John 14:6](https://www.bibleref.com/John/14/John-14-6.html)), should be the ultimate destination of our reasoning. Therefore, our faith should not be blind; it should be based on knowledge of God's nature, His promises in Scripture, and our personal experience walking with Him every day.

### Nurturing a Reasoned Faith

While we are called to have a reasoned faith, there may be times when we have to act purely on faith without having the complete picture, just as Abraham did. However, even in such situations, our faith is not blind but based on what we know about God and His character. Abraham's faith was rooted in his lifetime of walking with God and experiencing His faithfulness.

To nurture a reasoned faith, we can engage in various practices. First and foremost, studying the Scriptures is essential. By immersing ourselves in God's Word, we gain a deeper understanding of His nature and His promises. We can also seek wisdom through prayer, asking God for insight and understanding ([James 1:5](https://www.bibleref.com/James/1/James-1-5.html)). Additionally, engaging in conversations with fellow believers and learning from their experiences can help us grow in our faith.

### Why This Matters

Understanding the nature of faith is crucial because it shapes our relationship with God. If we view faith as blind belief without understanding, we may struggle to reconcile our doubts and questions with our desire to follow God. However, by embracing a reasoned faith, we can find assurance in knowing that God wants us to use our minds and hearts to seek Him.

A reasoned faith also helps us navigate challenges and trials. When we encounter difficulties, our understanding of God's character and promises can provide us with the strength and hope to persevere. It allows us to approach God with confidence, knowing that He is faithful and trustworthy.

### Think About It

1. How do you define faith? Does the concept of "blind faith" align with your understanding of faith?
2. Reflect on Abraham's example of faith. How can you apply the principles of reasoned faith to your own life?
3. Consider the role of reason and understanding in your relationship with God. How can you cultivate a deeper understanding of His nature and promises?

In conclusion, blind faith is not the kind of faith that God desires from us. Instead, God calls us to have a reasoned faith based on our knowledge and understanding of Him. While there may be times when we have to act purely on faith without complete understanding, our faith is grounded in what we know about God's character, His promises in Scripture, and our personal experiences walking with Him. By embracing a reasoned faith, we can deepen our relationship with God and find strength in difficult times.

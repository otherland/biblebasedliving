## Presence and Omnipresence

The Bible teaches that God is omnipresent, which means that He is present everywhere at all times. In Psalm 139, David acknowledges this truth by asking, "Where can I go from your Spirit? Where can I flee from your presence?" He then goes on to describe how even if he were to ascend to the heavens or descend to the depths of the sea, God would be there. This demonstrates that no matter where we go, God is always with us.

In Acts 17, the apostle Paul also affirms God's omnipresence when he says, "He is not far from any one of us. 'For in him we live and move and have our being.'" This highlights the fact that God's presence encompasses everything and everyone. Even though we may not always be aware of His presence, He is constantly near us.

However, there is another sense in which we can either be in or out of God's "presence." In this context, the presence of God refers to His divine blessing and embracing love. The children of God are promised to experience everlasting joy in His presence. As [Psalm 16:11](https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/16/Psalm-16-11.html) states, "You will fill me with joy in your presence, with eternal pleasures at your right hand." This indicates that being in God's presence brings about a sense of joy and fulfillment.

On the other hand, those who reject the gospel will be punished with everlasting destruction and shut out from the presence of the Lord. This separation from God's presence is a consequence of their rejection of Him. It is important to note that this punishment is not merely physical but also spiritual, as it involves being eternally separated from the glory and might of God.

The presence of God can also refer to a place of honor. Just as it is a privilege to stand in the presence of a king, standing in the presence of God carries great honor and significance. In [Luke 1:19](https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/1/Luke-1-19.html), the angel Gabriel describes himself as one who stands in the presence of God. This indicates that being in the presence of God is a position of honor and authority.

Furthermore, the presence of God can also be associated with the demonstration of overwhelming glory and heavenly majesty. When Isaiah had his vision of God on His throne, he described the seraphim as being unable to view God's glory directly. This demonstrates that the presence of God is awe-inspiring and humbling for sinful humanity to approach. It emphasizes the holiness and majesty of God.

The presence of God can also refer to a unique revelation of Himself to humanity. Throughout history, God has chosen specific locations or events to reveal His presence to His people. For example, Moses encountered God's presence at the burning bush, and later, God revealed Himself at Mount Sinai. These instances highlight how God chooses to manifest His presence in specific ways for the purpose of communicating with His people.

It is important to distinguish between God's omnipresence, which is His all-pervading presence, and His manifest presence, which refers to His overt and unmistakable interaction with us. While God is always present everywhere, there are times when He chooses to manifest His presence in a more tangible way so that we can recognize and experience Him more deeply.

### Why This Matters

Understanding the concept of God's omnipresence and manifest presence is significant for our relationship with Him. Recognizing that God is always with us brings comfort, assurance, and a sense of security. We can find solace in knowing that we are never alone, even in our most challenging moments.

Knowing that God's presence carries blessings and joy encourages us to seek after Him and cultivate a deeper connection with Him. It reminds us that true fulfillment and happiness are found in His presence.

Additionally, understanding the honor and awe associated with being in the presence of God helps us approach Him with reverence and respect. It reminds us of His holiness and the need for repentance and humility in His presence.

### Think About It

1. Take a moment to reflect on the concept of God's omnipresence. How does knowing that God is always with you impact your daily life?

2. Consider the privilege of being in the presence of God. How does this perspective change the way you approach Him in prayer, worship, and obedience?

3. Reflect on the manifestations of God's presence throughout history. How have these instances deepened your understanding of God's character and His desire to communicate with His people?

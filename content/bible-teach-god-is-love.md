## Bible Teaches That God is Love

The Bible teaches that God is love, but it also reveals that He is more than just love. The apostle John emphasizes this in his letter, stating twice that God is love ([1 John 4:8](https://www.bibleref.com/1-John/4/1-John-4-8.html), 16). While other passages describe the love that God expresses, John uniquely declares that God's essence is love. However, it is important to note that John does not imply that God is merely a concept or equal to love; rather, he consistently recognizes God as a personal being described by the attribute of love.

While love is a central aspect of God's character, there are other divine attributes that are equally important. In fact, one attribute may be even more definitive of who God is. John's record in Revelation depicts a scene in heaven where four creatures continually proclaim, "Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God, the Almighty, who was and who is and who is to come" ([Revelation 4:8](https://www.bibleref.com/Revelation/4/Revelation-4-8.html)). This scene echoes Isaiah's vision in which seraphim declare the holiness of the Lord ([Isaiah 6:3](https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/6/Isaiah-6-3.html)).

Isaiah's encounter with God further reinforces the priority of His holiness. While Isaiah acknowledges God's grace, compassion, and lovingkindness, he also recognizes the supreme significance of God's holiness. This demonstrates that even God's love is defined by His holiness. Therefore, we must rely on Him to define what love truly is and how He desires us to express it.

Thankfully, God has provided the perfect example of His love through Jesus Christ. This demonstration of love encompasses all humanity ([John 3:16](https://www.bibleref.com/John/3/John-3-16.html)). Those who believe in Jesus are called to emulate His mindset, maintaining the same love and following His example of humility and service to others ([Philippians 2:2-8](https://www.bibleref.com/Philippians/2/Philippians-2-2.html)). As recipients of God's love, we are called to reciprocate by loving Him and one another ([1 John 4:19](https://www.bibleref.com/1-John/4/1-John-4-19.html), 20).

God is both holy and loving. His love has been expressed to the world in various ways, but most significantly through Jesus Christ. As believers, we are expected to receive His love by placing our faith in Jesus and then continue growing in our understanding of how to love God and others in a manner that aligns with His holiness ([Romans 5:1-2](https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/5/Romans-5-1.html); [Ephesians 3:14-19](https://www.bibleref.com/Ephesians/3/Ephesians-3-14.html); 4:1). We are called to reflect both holiness and love as children of God ([1 Peter 1:15-16](https://www.bibleref.com/1-Peter/1/1-Peter-1-15.html); [1 Thessalonians 4:9](https://www.bibleref.com/1-Thessalonians/4/1-Thessalonians-4-9.html)).

### Why This Matters

Understanding that God is both love and holiness is crucial for our relationship with Him. Recognizing His holiness helps us grasp the magnitude of His love and the importance of reflecting His character in our lives. It also reminds us that love, as defined by God, goes beyond mere sentimentality or personal preference. Instead, it encompasses selflessness, sacrifice, and a commitment to holiness.

This understanding also shapes how we view and experience love in our relationships with others. As followers of Christ, we are called to love others with a love that mirrors God's holiness. This means being willing to put others' needs before our own, forgiving as we have been forgiven, and seeking to reflect the character of Christ in all our interactions.

### Think About It

1. How does understanding that God is both love and holiness impact your view of His love for you?

2. In what ways can you reflect both holiness and love in your relationships with others?

3. How might your understanding of love change when you consider it through the lens of God's holiness?

4. Reflect on the sacrificial love demonstrated by Jesus on the cross. How does this example challenge your understanding of love?

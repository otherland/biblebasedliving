Title: "Understanding the First Person of the Trinity: Unveiling the Mystery of God's Triune Nature"

## The First Person of the Trinity

The Trinity is a concept in Christianity that describes God as existing eternally as three distinct Persons: the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Although the word "Trinity" is not found in the New Testament, Christians believe it best represents the nature of God as revealed to us. In this article, we will focus on the first Person of the Trinity, namely God the Father.

### The Concept of the Trinity

The term Trinity does not imply a hierarchy or levels of importance among the Persons of the godhead. Instead, it emphasizes the equality and unity of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. As stated in the Athanasian Creed, "We worship one God in Trinity, and Trinity in Unity, neither confounding the persons, nor dividing the substance. For there is one Person of the Father, another of the Son, and another of the Holy Spirit. But the godhead of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit is all one, the glory equal, the majesty co-eternal." Thus, while each Person of the Trinity is co-eternal and co-equal ontologically (in their being), they play different roles when relating to humanity.

### The First Person of the Trinity

In [Matthew 28:19](https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/28/Matthew-28-19.html), where Jesus gives the Trinitarian formula for baptism, He presents the Father first: "Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit." This order suggests that within the economic Trinity (how God relates to creation), the Father holds a primary position. However, it is important to note that this does not imply superiority or greater significance; rather, it signifies His role as initiator and leader.

In addition to being listed first in this formula, we can understand why God the Father is referred to as "first" by considering His priority within the economic Trinity. This is comparable to the head of a household who holds a leadership role. The Father sent Jesus into the world ([John 6:57](https://www.bibleref.com/John/6/John-6-57.html)), and Jesus lived on earth in submission to the Father, doing only what He saw the Father doing ([John 5:19](https://www.bibleref.com/John/5/John-5-19.html)). Furthermore, it is the Father who raised Jesus from the dead ([Acts 2:32](https://www.bibleref.com/Acts/2/Acts-2-32.html)) and will be glorified in the redemption of humanity ([Philippians 2:9](https://www.bibleref.com/Philippians/2/Philippians-2-9.html)â€“11).

### Why This Matters

Understanding the concept of the first Person of the Trinity helps us grasp how God reveals Himself and relates to humanity. It emphasizes the unity and equality of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit while acknowledging their distinct roles. Recognizing God the Father as the first Person of the Trinity highlights His position as leader and initiator within the godhead.

### Think About It

Consider how knowing that God the Father holds a leadership role within the Trinity can impact your perception of God's character and His relationship with humanity. Reflect on how this understanding influences your own perspective on leadership and submission in your own life.

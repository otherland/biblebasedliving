Title: 'Divine Sustenance: God''s Unfailing Support for Believers'

## God is Our Sustainer

Throughout Scripture, God is described as the one who sustains all things. When we say that God is our sustainer, we mean that He gives us strength, protection, encouragement, and comfort. His power to sustain surpasses any human effort. As believers, we are adopted into God's family through Jesus Christ, becoming His children. In difficult times, God sustains us and helps us. The psalmists often expressed their reliance on God's sustaining power when they faced weariness or distress.

### Sustained by God's Strength

On our own, our strength is finite and limited. We may try to gain strength from worldly things, but they will always disappoint and leave us emptier than before. Only God, the infinite and limitless Creator, can sustain us. When we feel like we are falling apart or have nothing left to give, we must turn to Him for help. God is the source of unending and sustaining strength.

### The Creator Who Holds All Things Together

Not only does God sustain us individually, but He also sustains all things in the universe. The physical laws that hold matter together and keep planets in their positions are sustained by Him. This includes the laws that bind people to the earth. In fact, everything in creation is held together through Jesus Christ. He is the one who keeps everything aligned and functioning according to His divine plan.

### Why This Matters

Understanding that God is our sustainer has significant implications for our lives as believers. It reminds us of our dependency on Him and encourages us to turn to Him for help and strength. When we face challenges or feel overwhelmed, we can trust in God's sustaining power to carry us through. It also points to the greatness of our Creator who not only sustains us individually but also upholds the entire universe.

### Think About It

Pause for a moment and reflect on how God has sustained you in the past. How has He given you strength, protection, encouragement, and comfort? Take time to thank Him for His faithfulness in sustaining you. And when you find yourself facing difficulties or feeling weak, remember that God is always there to sustain you once again. Trust in His power and seek His help.

## What Year Was Jesus Born?

The exact year of Jesus' birth is not explicitly mentioned in the Bible. However, by carefully examining the historical and biblical details surrounding Jesus' birth, we can narrow down the possibilities to a reasonable window of time.

### The Time of Herod the King

According to [Matthew 2:1](https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/2/Matthew-2-1.html), Jesus was born during the days of Herod the king. Since Herod died in 4 B.C., this sets a parameter for when Jesus could have been born. Additionally, after Jesus' birth, Herod ordered the killing of all boys two years old and younger in the vicinity of Bethlehem. This suggests that Jesus could have been as old as two before Herod's death. Taking these details into account, we can conclude that Jesus was likely born between 6 and 4 B.C.

### The Decree of Caesar Augustus

[Luke 2:1-2](https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/2/Luke-2-1.html) provides further clues about the timing of Jesus' birth. It mentions a decree from Caesar Augustus that required a registration of all people. This registration occurred when Quirinius was governor of Syria. Caesar Augustus reigned from 27 B.C. to A.D. 14, and Quirinius governed Syria around 6 B.C. Some scholars debate whether this census mentioned by Luke is the same event, but it seems likely that it is. Based on this information, we can place Jesus' birth in Bethlehem around 6-5 B.C.

### The Ministry of Jesus

Luke also mentions that Jesus began His ministry at approximately thirty years of age ([Luke 3:23](https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/3/Luke-3-23.html)). His ministry started during the time when John the Baptist was ministering in the wilderness. [Luke 3:1-2](https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/3/Luke-3-1.html) provides additional context, stating that it was during the fifteenth year of Tiberius Caesar's reign, with Pontius Pilate as governor of Judea, Herod as tetrarch of Galilee, Philip as tetrarch of the region of Ituraea and Trachonitis, and Lysanias as tetrarch of Abilene. It was also during the high priesthood of Annas and Caiaphas.

Considering these details, the only time period that aligns with all the historical and biblical facts is A.D. 27-29. If Jesus was approximately thirty years old in A.D. 27, a birth between 6 and 4 B.C. would fit this timeline. Therefore, Jesus would have been around thirty-two years old when He began His ministry.

### The Date of Jesus' Birth

While the exact day of Jesus' birth is unknown, the tradition of celebrating it on December 25th developed long after the New Testament period. Christians have agreed upon this date to commemorate His birth, but it does not have a specific biblical basis.

In summary, by examining the historical and biblical details, we can conclude that Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea between 6 and 4 B.C., during the time of Herod the king. The approximate year of His birth is supported by various chronological factors mentioned in the Gospels. This event changed history forever and continues to impact countless lives around the world.

### Why This Matters

Understanding the approximate year of Jesus' birth helps us place His life and ministry into historical context. It allows us to see how God's timing and plan unfolded in human history. Recognizing that Jesus was born in a specific time and place emphasizes His humanity while affirming His divinity as God incarnate.

Knowing the historical details surrounding Jesus' birth also strengthens our confidence in the reliability of the biblical accounts. The Gospels provide specific historical markers that can be corroborated with external sources, enhancing our understanding and trust in God's Word.

### Think About It

Consider how knowing the approximate year of Jesus' birth impacts your understanding of His life and ministry. Reflect on the significance of Jesus entering human history at a specific time and place. How does this reinforce your faith in the accuracy and reliability of the biblical accounts? Take a moment to thank God for His perfect timing and plan in sending Jesus to save humanity.

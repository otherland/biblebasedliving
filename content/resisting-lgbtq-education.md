## Resisting LGBTQ+ Education: A Conservative Christian Perspective

### Introduction

In recent years, there has been a growing push to introduce LGBTQ+ education in schools, promoting gender ideology and challenging traditional views of sexuality. As conservative Christians, it is essential to understand [the biblical perspective](/family-structure) on these issues and how to respond to the cultural shifts around us. In this article, we will address [eight key questions](/fighting-pornography) related to resisting LGBTQ+ education from a staunchly conservative, biblical perspective.

### 1. Why are some Christians resisting LGBTQ+ education?

Many Christians resist LGBTQ+ education because they believe it undermines biblical values and promotes a worldview that contradicts God's design for sexuality and gender. They see it as an attempt to indoctrinate young minds with a secular ideology that is incompatible with their faith. As followers of Christ, they are called to uphold the teachings of Scripture and cannot compromise on issues that are clearly addressed in the Bible.

**Biblical Foundation:**
- [Genesis 1:27](https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/1/Genesis-1-27.html) - "So God created man in his own image, in the image of God he created him; male and female he created them."
- [Romans 1:26-27](https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/1/Romans-1-26.html) - "For this reason God gave them up to dishonorable passions. For their women exchanged natural relations for those that are contrary to nature; and the men likewise gave up natural relations with women and were consumed with passion for one another."

### 2. How do conservative Christians view parental rights in sexuality education?

Conservative Christians believe that parents have the primary responsibility for teaching their children about sexuality according to biblical principles. They view sexuality as a sacred gift from God, designed to be expressed within the bounds of marriage between one man and one woman. Parents have the right to guide their children's understanding of gender and sexuality, ensuring it aligns with their deeply held religious beliefs.

**Biblical Foundation:**
- [Deuteronomy 6:6-7](https://www.bibleref.com/Deuteronomy/6/Deuteronomy-6-6.html) - "[And these words](/spiritual-formation) that I command you today shall be on your heart. You shall teach them diligently to your children, and shall talk of them when you sit in your house, and when you walk by the way, and when you lie down, and when you rise."
- [Proverbs 22:6](https://www.bibleref.com/Proverbs/22/Proverbs-22-6.html) - "Train up a child in the way he should go; even when he is old he will not depart from it."

### 3. How does biblical sexuality teaching benefit children?

Teaching children about biblical sexuality provides them with a solid foundation rooted in God's design for relationships and human flourishing. It helps them understand their identity as male or female, created in God's image, and provides guidance on how to navigate issues related to sexuality in a world that often promotes conflicting messages. It equips children with a biblical worldview that fosters healthy relationships, self-respect, and an understanding of the purpose and beauty of sex within marriage.

**Biblical Foundation:**
- [Psalm 119:9](https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/119/Psalm-119-9.html) - "How can a young man keep his way pure? By guarding it according to your word."
- [Ephesians 5:31-33](https://www.bibleref.com/Ephesians/5/Ephesians-5-31.html) - "Therefore a man shall leave his father and mother and hold fast to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh. This mystery is profound, and I am saying that it refers to Christ and the church."

### 4. How does challenging gender ideology in schools align with biblical teachings?

Challenging gender ideology in schools aligns with biblical teachings because it upholds the belief that biological sex is determined by God at birth and is not a matter of personal choice or societal construct. The Bible affirms the binary nature of gender, recognizing only male and female as distinct and complementary. Gender ideology, which promotes the idea that gender is fluid and can be chosen or changed, undermines the biblical understanding of human identity and God's design for relationships.

**Biblical Foundation:**
- [Matthew 19:4](https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/19/Matthew-19-4.html) - "He answered, 'Have you not read that he who created them from the beginning made them male and female?'"
- [1 Corinthians 11:14-15](https://www.bibleref.com/1-Corinthians/11/1-Corinthians-11-14.html) - "Does not nature itself teach you that if a man wears long hair it is a disgrace for him, but if a woman has long hair, it is her glory? For her hair is given to her for a covering."

### 5. What impact does LGBTQ+ education have on students' mental health?

Research shows that LGBTQ+ students who attend schools with policies promoting LGBTQ+ education experience worse mental health outcomes compared to their peers in schools without such policies. LGBTQ+ students may face increased harassment, discrimination, and feelings of isolation when their schools promote ideologies that conflict with their religious beliefs or personal convictions. Conservative Christians believe that promoting biblical teachings on sexuality and gender can provide a more inclusive environment that respects the dignity of all students.

**Biblical Foundation:**
- [Proverbs 14:12](https://www.bibleref.com/Proverbs/14/Proverbs-14-12.html) - "There is a way that seems right to a man, but its end is the way to death."
- [John 8:32](https://www.bibleref.com/John/8/John-8-32.html) - "And you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free."

Secondly, they can form alliances with other like-minded parents and organizations to support each other and collectively address issues related to LGBTQ+ education. Lastly, they can provide a strong foundation of biblical teaching at home, equipping their children with a solid understanding of God's design for sexuality and gender.

**Biblical Foundation:**
- [Proverbs 1:8-9](https://www.bibleref.com/Proverbs/1/Proverbs-1-8.html) - "Hear, my son, your father's instruction, and forsake not your mother's teaching, for they are a graceful garland for your head and pendants for your neck."
- [Deuteronomy 4:9](https://www.bibleref.com/Deuteronomy/4/Deuteronomy-4-9.html) - "Only take care, and keep your soul diligently, lest you forget the things that your eyes have seen, and lest they depart from your heart all the days of your life."

### 7. How can Christians engage in respectful dialogue with those who support LGBTQ+ education?

It is essential to listen attentively to others' perspectives without compromising on biblical principles. Christians can respectfully articulate their convictions, explaining the biblical basis for their beliefs while fostering an environment of open dialogue. By building relationships based on respect and understanding, Christians can create opportunities to share the Gospel and demonstrate the transformative power of God's love.

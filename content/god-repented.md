## God's Repentance: Understanding the Biblical Perspective

### Introduction

In the Bible, there are instances where it is mentioned that God "repented." This can be confusing because repentance is often associated with human beings acknowledging their sins and changing their ways. However, when we talk about God's repentance, it is important to understand that it is described in human terms, known as anthropomorphism. It does not imply that God changes His mind or gains new information, as He is omniscient and knows all things from the beginning. Instead, it refers to how God interacts with us in real time and responds to our actions and decisions.

### 1. The Meaning of Repentance

Repentance, at its core, means "to change one's mind." When we repent of our sins, we change our perspective on sin, recognizing it as evil and harmful instead of accepting it as good or enjoyable. This change of mind leads to a change in our actions and behavior.

### 2. God's Timeless Knowledge

God possesses timeless knowledge and does not gain new information that would cause Him to change His mind. [Numbers 23:19](https://www.bibleref.com/Numbers/23/Numbers-23-19.html) states that God does not lie or repent because He never gains access to new information. His omniscience allows Him to know what will happen before it occurs. Therefore, when we speak of God's repentance, it is not a literal change of mind but rather an interaction in real time with humanity.

### 3. Interaction with Humans

God interacts with humanity in the present moment. He does not treat us based on future sins or future repentance. If we are walking in obedience and fellowship with Him today, He does not act on the sins we may commit in the future. Similarly, if we are living in sinfulness now but are going to repent later, God does not treat us as if we have already repented. He deals with us in the present, according to our current situation and actions.

### 4. God's Repentance in the Bible

In the King James Version of the Bible, there are verses such as [Jeremiah 26:13](https://www.bibleref.com/Jeremiah/26/Jeremiah-26-13.html), [1 Chronicles 21:15](https://www.bibleref.com/1-Chronicles/21/1-Chronicles-21-15.html), and [Joel 2:13](https://www.bibleref.com/Joel/2/Joel-2-13.html) that mention God's repentance. However, it is important to note that the term "repented" can be misleading. The NIV translation, for example, uses the term "relent," which conveys the idea more accurately. These verses describe instances where God was going to bring judgment upon people, but in response to their change of mind about sin (repentance), God also "changed His mind" about the judgment. He relented and did not bring the disaster He had pronounced.

### 5. The Eternal Level

On the eternal level, God does not change His mind or repent because He sees all things from the beginning to the end. His plans are unchanging and perfect. However, when interacting with humanity, His actions and responses may vary based on our choices and decisions. This allows for a dynamic relationship between God and humanity, where our actions can influence His response.

### Why This Matters

Understanding God's repentance in human terms helps us grasp His relational nature. It demonstrates that God responds to our decisions and actions in real time. This encourages us to take responsibility for our choices and seek repentance when we have strayed from His ways.

### Think About It

Consider how God's interaction with us in real time impacts your understanding of repentance. Does it change how you view your own relationship with God? How might this understanding affect your perspective on sin and its consequences?

In conclusion, when we encounter passages in the Bible that mention God's repentance, it is crucial to interpret them within the framework of anthropomorphism. God's "repentance" does not imply a literal change of mind or a lack of omniscience. Instead, it highlights His dynamic interaction with humanity, responding to our choices and actions. Understanding God's repentance in this way deepens our appreciation for His relational nature and encourages us to seek repentance and obedience in our own lives.

## 1. What does the Bible say about answered prayer?

The Bible contains numerous verses that affirm God's willingness to answer our prayers. One such verse is found in [Matthew 7:7-8](https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/7/Matthew-7-7.html) (ESV), where Jesus says, "Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you. For everyone who asks receives, and the one who seeks finds, and to the one who knocks it will be opened." This verse assures us that if we ask, seek, and knock in faith, God will respond.

Another passage that emphasizes the certainty of answered prayer is found in [1 John 5:14-15](https://www.bibleref.com/1-John/5/1-John-5-14.html) (NIV): "This is the confidence we have in approaching God: that if we ask anything according to his will, he hears us. And if we know that he hears us—whatever we ask—we know that we have what we asked of him." These verses teach us that when we align our requests with God's will, He hears and grants them.

Additionally, James 5:16b (NIV) encourages believers to pray with confidence: "The prayer of a righteous person is powerful and effective." This verse highlights the importance of living a righteous life and maintaining a close relationship with God, as it can greatly impact the effectiveness of our prayers.

## 2. How should we approach prayer in order to have our prayers answered?

Approaching prayer with the right heart and attitude is essential for having our prayers answered. Jesus provides guidance on this matter in [Mark 11:24](https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/11/Mark-11-24.html) (NIV): "Therefore I tell you, whatever you ask for in prayer, believe that you have received it, and it will be yours." This verse emphasizes the importance of faith. When we pray, we must believe that God will answer according to [His perfect plan](/scripture-on-prayer-and-supplication) and timing.

In addition to faith, humility is another crucial aspect of effective prayer. In [Luke 18:9-14](https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/18/Luke-18-9.html) (NIV), Jesus shares a parable about a Pharisee and a tax collector praying in the temple. The tax collector humbly acknowledged his need for God's mercy, while the Pharisee boasted about his righteousness. Jesus concludes by saying, "I tell you that this man, rather than the other, went home justified before God" (Luke 18:14a NIV). This parable teaches us that approaching God with humility and recognizing our dependence on Him is vital for answered prayer.

Moreover, Jesus instructs His disciples in [John 15:7](https://www.bibleref.com/John/15/John-15-7.html) (NIV), saying, "If you remain in me and my words remain in you, ask whatever you wish, and it will be done for you." This verse highlights the importance of abiding in Christ and aligning our desires with His teachings. When we are intimately connected to Jesus and His Word, our prayers will reflect His will, leading to a greater likelihood of them being answered.

## 3. Does God always answer our prayers in the way we expect?

No, God does not always answer our prayers in the way we expect. His ways are higher than ours, and He sees the bigger picture that we may not comprehend. [Isaiah 55:8-9](https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/55/Isaiah-55-8.html) (NIV) reminds us of this truth: "For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways,” declares the LORD. “As the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts."

Sometimes, God's answers may be different from what we desire or anticipate. However, we can trust that His plans are ultimately for our good ([Romans 8:28](https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/8/Romans-8-28.html)) and aligned with His perfect wisdom. It is important to remember that God's answers are based on His infinite knowledge and love for us.

In [Matthew 26:39](https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/26/Matthew-26-39.html) (NIV), Jesus provides an example of praying according to God's will even when it differs from His own desire. In the Garden of Gethsemane, Jesus prayed, "My Father, if it is possible, may this cup be taken from me. Yet not as I will, but as you will." Jesus submitted His desires to the Father's will, demonstrating a profound [trust in God](/transformative-power-of-christian-prayer-comprehensive-guide)'s plan.

## Bible verses:

- [Isaiah 55:8-9](https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/55/Isaiah-55-8.html) (NIV): "For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways,” declares the LORD. “As the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts."
- [Matthew 26:39](https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/26/Matthew-26-39.html) (NIV): "My Father, if it is possible, may this cup be taken from me. Yet not as I will, but as you will."

## 4. What are some examples of answered prayers in the Bible?

Throughout the Bible, we find numerous examples of prayers being answered. These accounts serve as a testament to God's faithfulness and His willingness to respond to His people's cries.

One notable example is found in [1 Kings 18:36-37](https://www.bibleref.com/1-Kings/18/1-Kings-18-36.html) (NIV), when the prophet Elijah confronted the prophets of Baal on Mount Carmel. Despite the odds stacked against him, Elijah prayed for God to demonstrate His power by consuming the offering with fire. In response to his prayer, "the fire of the LORD fell and burned up the sacrifice, the wood, the stones and the soil, and also licked up the water in the trench" ([1 Kings 18:38](https://www.bibleref.com/1-Kings/18/1-Kings-18-38.html) NIV). This powerful display of answered prayer led to the people's repentance and recognition of God's supremacy.

Another remarkable example is recorded in [Acts 12:5-11](https://www.bibleref.com/Acts/12/Acts-12-5.html) (NIV). The early church was fervently praying for Peter, who was imprisoned by King Herod. While Peter was sleeping in his cell, an angel of the Lord appeared and miraculously released him. When Peter arrived at Mary's house, where many believers were gathered in prayer, they were astounded and overjoyed at the answered prayer.

These accounts remind us that God is not limited by human circumstances or impossibilities. He can intervene in extraordinary ways when His people call upon Him in faith.

## Bible verses:

- [1 Kings 18:38](https://www.bibleref.com/1-Kings/18/1-Kings-18-38.html) (NIV): "Then the fire of the LORD fell and burned up the sacrifice, the wood, the stones and the soil, and also licked up the water in the trench."
- [Acts 12:5-6](https://www.bibleref.com/Acts/12/Acts-12-5.html) (NIV): "So Peter was kept in prison, but the church was earnestly praying to God for him. The night before Herod was to bring him to trial, Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains, and sentries stood guard at the entrance."

## 5. How can we grow in faith when our prayers seem unanswered?

At times, it may seem like our prayers go unanswered, leading to feelings of doubt and discouragement. However, during these moments, it is crucial to remember that God works in [His perfect timing](/pray-for-the-weak) and according to His sovereign plan. We can use these seasons as opportunities to grow in faith and deepen our trust in Him.

One way to cultivate faith is by immersing ourselves in God's Word. [Romans 10:17](https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/10/Romans-10-17.html) (NIV) declares, "Consequently, faith comes from hearing the message, and the message is heard through the word about Christ." Regularly reading and meditating on the Bible allows us to discover God's promises and faithfulness throughout history. It reminds us of His character and builds confidence in His ability to answer prayers.

Additionally, prayer plays a vital role in growing our faith. In [Mark 9:24](https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/9/Mark-9-24.html) (NIV), a father pleads with Jesus to heal his demon-possessed son, saying, "I do believe; help me overcome my unbelief!" Like this father, we can bring our doubts and struggles before God and ask Him to strengthen our faith. By seeking Him earnestly in prayer and surrendering our uncertainties to Him, we open ourselves up to experiencing His transformative power.

Furthermore, sharing our struggles with other believers can provide encouragement and support. [Hebrews 10:24-25](https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/10/Hebrews-10-24.html) (NIV) exhorts us to "consider how we may spur one another on toward love and good deeds, not giving up meeting together," emphasizing the importance of community. Through fellowship with fellow Christians, we can find solace and wisdom as we navigate seasons of unanswered prayer.

## Bible verses:

- [Romans 10:17](https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/10/Romans-10-17.html) (NIV): "Consequently, faith comes from hearing the message, and the message is heard through the word about Christ."
- [Mark 9:24](https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/9/Mark-9-24.html) (NIV): "I do believe; help me overcome my unbelief!"

## 6. Are there any conditions or requirements for prayers to be answered?

While God desires to answer our prayers, there are certain conditions or requirements that we need to consider. One crucial aspect is aligning our requests with God's will. [1 John 5:14](https://www.bibleref.com/1-John/5/1-John-5-14.html) (ESV) states, "And this is the confidence that we have toward him, that if we ask anything according to his will he hears us." When we pray in accordance with God's will, our requests are more likely to be answered because they align with His purposes.

Another condition for answered prayer is a right relationship with God. In [Psalm 66:18](https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/66/Psalm-66-18.html) (NIV), it says, "If I had cherished sin in my heart, the Lord would not have listened." Unconfessed sin or living in disobedience can hinder our prayers from being answered. Therefore, it is essential to maintain a repentant heart and seek forgiveness when we fall short.

Furthermore, Jesus emphasizes the importance of forgiveness in prayer in [Mark 11:25](https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/11/Mark-11-25.html) (NIV): "And when you stand praying, if you hold anything against anyone, forgive them so that your Father in heaven may forgive you your sins." Forgiving others is crucial for maintaining a healthy relationship with God and allowing our prayers to be heard and answered.

## Bible verses:

- [1 John 5:14](https://www.bibleref.com/1-John/5/1-John-5-14.html) (ESV): "And this is the confidence that we have toward him, that if we ask anything according to his will he hears us."
- [Mark 11:25](https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/11/Mark-11-25.html) (NIV): "And when you stand praying, if you hold anything against anyone, forgive them so that your Father in heaven may forgive you your sins."

## 7. How can we discern whether a prayer has been answered?

Discerning whether a prayer has been answered requires spiritual sensitivity and attentiveness to God's leading. Sometimes, the answer may be obvious, while at other times, it may require a deeper understanding of God's ways.

Firstly, it is essential to compare our prayers with God's Word. If our requests align with biblical principles and God's will, it increases the likelihood of them being answered. By studying the Scriptures and seeking guidance from [the Holy Spirit](/understanding-the-difference-between-water-baptism-and-spirit-baptism-a-comprehensive-guide-for-christian-believers), we can discern whether our prayers are consistent with God's character and purposes.

Secondly, paying attention to circumstances and God's providence can provide insight into His answers. In [Proverbs 16:9](https://www.bibleref.com/Proverbs/16/Proverbs-16-9.html) (NIV), it says, "In their hearts humans plan their course, but the LORD establishes their steps." As we surrender our plans to God and trust in His guidance, He may direct us through open or closed doors, confirming His response to our prayers.

Moreover, seeking wise counsel from mature believers can help us gain perspective and discernment. [Proverbs 15:22](https://www.bibleref.com/Proverbs/15/Proverbs-15-22.html) (NIV) advises, "Plans fail for lack of counsel, but with many advisers they succeed." Consulting trustworthy Christians who have a deep understanding of God's Word can provide clarity and confirmation regarding the answers to our prayers.

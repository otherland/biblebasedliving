## Honor God

To honor God is to give Him the respect, praise, and value that He deserves. In the Bible, the concepts of glory and honor are closely related when it comes to honoring God. The word "glory" refers to something that has inherent, intrinsic worth, while the word "honor" refers to the perceived value or esteem placed on someone or something. When we glorify God, we reflect His character and acknowledge His infinite worth. Honoring God originates from our hearts and involves recognizing His significance in our lives.

### What is Glory?

Glory can be seen as a mirror that accurately reflects what is truly there. When we accurately reflect the character of God, we glorify Him. We bring Him glory by demonstrating His glorious character or deeds through our words and actions. As human beings created in the image of God, we also have glory. Our glory comes from being made in the image of the all-glorious One. By modeling the character of Jesus, we showcase His attributes and bring glory to God.

### What is Honor?

Honor, on the other hand, refers to the value we personally place on someone or something. It originates from our hearts and is based on considering someone's position or contributions significant. The Bible commands us to honor various individuals based on their positions, such as our fathers and mothers, the elderly, and those who rule over us. When we honor God, we demonstrate a high regard for Him and reflect His glory back to Him through praise and worship.

The Bible provides us with many ways to honor and glorify God. Living lives devoted to Him, being sexually pure, giving of our income, seeking Him in everything we do, and delighting in Him are all ways in which we can honor and glorify God. However, it is important to note that simply outwardly honoring God is not enough. God desires honor that comes from our hearts. He wants us to have a genuine love and devotion for Him, not just empty words or actions.

### Why This Matters

Understanding the concepts of honoring and glorifying God is essential for Christians because it helps us develop a deeper relationship with Him. By recognizing God's infinite worth and reflecting His character, we align ourselves with His purposes and invite His presence into our lives. Honoring God also shapes our interactions with others, as we are called to honor those in positions of authority and those around us.

### Think About It

Take some time to reflect on how you currently honor and glorify God in your life. Are there areas where you can grow in giving Him the respect and value He deserves? Consider the importance of having a genuine heart of honor and how that can impact your relationship with God and others.

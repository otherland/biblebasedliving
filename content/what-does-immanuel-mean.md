## Immanuel: God With Us

The name Immanuel is derived from Hebrew and means "God with us" or "God is with us." It appears three times in the Bible, twice in the Old Testament book of Isaiah and once in the Gospel of Matthew. In Isaiah, the name Immanuel was given to a child born during the time of King Ahaz as a sign to the king that Judah would receive relief from attacks by Israel and Syria. The prophecy stated that a virgin would conceive and give birth to a son who would be called Immanuel.

In the Gospel of Matthew, this prophecy is seen as being fulfilled through Jesus Christ. Mary, a virgin from Nazareth who was engaged to Joseph, conceived a child through the Holy Spirit. The angel who appeared to Joseph confirmed this and instructed him to name the child Jesus. Matthew recognized that Jesus is the fulfillment of Isaiah's prophecy, as he is the embodiment of Immanuel, "God with us."

Jesus, as Immanuel, is not just a partial revelation of God with us but rather God with us in all His fullness. He is fully human yet fully God. Through Jesus, God walked among humanity just as He did with Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden. Jesus' arrival demonstrates God's faithfulness to fulfill His promises.

Jesus' purpose as Immanuel was not only to live among us but also to die for our sins on the cross. Through His sacrifice and shed blood, we can be reconciled to God. When we are born again by His Spirit, Christ comes to live within us. Our Immanuel is not just present during our earthly lives but will be with us forever. After His resurrection, Jesus promised to be with us always until the end of the age.

### Why This Matters

Understanding and embracing Jesus as Immanuel has profound implications for our faith. It signifies that God is not distant or detached from us but instead desires to be intimately involved in our lives. Through Jesus, God has made Himself known to humanity, revealing His character, love, and grace. This revelation invites us to have a personal relationship with Him and experience His presence in our daily lives.

Recognizing Jesus as Immanuel also assures us of God's faithfulness and reliability. Just as He fulfilled the prophecy of Immanuel through Jesus, we can trust that He will fulfill His promises to us. We can find comfort and hope knowing that we are never alone because God is with us every step of the way.

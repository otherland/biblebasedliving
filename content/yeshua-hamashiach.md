## Yeshua Hamashiach

Yeshua Hamashiach, which means "Jesus the Messiah," is a significant name in the Christian faith. The name Jesus is the Greek form of the Hebrew name Yeshua, derived from the Hebrew word Yehoshua. This Hebrew name is also associated with the name Joshua ([Joshua 5:15](https://www.bibleref.com/Joshua/5/Joshua-5-15.html)) or Hoshea ([Numbers 13:8](https://www.bibleref.com/Numbers/13/Numbers-13-8.html); [Deuteronomy 32:44](https://www.bibleref.com/Deuteronomy/32/Deuteronomy-32-44.html)). Yeshua means "salvation" and is frequently mentioned throughout the Old Testament. It is from this Hebrew name that the Greek word Iesous, pronounced "yay-sus," or as we say it, "Jesus," originates.

The term Mashiach, or Messiah in English, is derived from Hebrew and means "anointed one." In the Old Testament, God's mashiachs were individuals anointed with oil to symbolize the presence and authority of the Holy Spirit ([Leviticus 4:3](https://www.bibleref.com/Leviticus/4/Leviticus-4-3.html); [1 Samuel 12:14](https://www.bibleref.com/1-Samuel/12/1-Samuel-12-14.html); [2 Samuel 19:21](https://www.bibleref.com/2-Samuel/19/2-Samuel-19-21.html)). God had promised Israel an ultimate Mashiach or Messiah and provided over 300 prophecies about this Anointed One to ensure they could recognize Him when He came ([Isaiah 53:1](https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/53/Isaiah-53-1.html); [Psalm 22:27](https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/22/Psalm-22-27.html); [Daniel 9:25](https://www.bibleref.com/Daniel/9/Daniel-9-25.html); 7:13). Jesus fulfilled every one of these prophecies, thus deserving the title Yeshua Hamaschiach for the Jewish people.

### Why This Matters

Understanding the significance of the name Yeshua Hamashiach helps us grasp the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies concerning the coming Messiah. It underscores Jesus' role as the Anointed One who brings salvation to humanity. Recognizing Jesus as Yeshua Hamashiach deepens our understanding of His divine mission and enables us to appreciate His fulfillment of ancient promises.

### The Name Yeshua

The original Hebrew-Aramaic name of Jesus is Yeshua, which is a shortened form of Yehoshua. Just as "Mike" is short for "Michael," Yeshua is a shorter version of Yehoshua. The name Yeshua appears 27 times in the Hebrew Scriptures, primarily referring to the high priest after the Babylonian exile. In these instances, he is called both yehōshuˈa (see, e.g., [Zechariah 3:3](https://www.bibleref.com/Zechariah/3/Zechariah-3-3.html)) and, more frequently, yeshuˈa (see, e.g., [Ezra 3:2](https://www.bibleref.com/Ezra/3/Ezra-3-2.html)). Therefore, Yeshua's name was not unusual; multiple men in the Old Testament bore this name. It is important to note that Jesus' name being translated as Yeshua in English is not a pagan corruption but rather a natural linguistic transition.

### The Meaning of Mashiach

The Hebrew term Mashiach, or Messiah, means "anointed one." It refers to an individual set apart to serve Yahweh. In the Old Testament, individuals chosen by God were anointed with oil to symbolize the presence and authority of the Holy Spirit. This anointing signified their consecration for specific roles, such as prophets, priests, and kings. The title of Messiah carried the expectation of God's chosen savior who would bring salvation and deliverance to His people.

### Jesus as the Fulfillment of Prophecy

Throughout the Old Testament, God provided numerous prophecies about the coming Messiah. These prophecies described specific details regarding His birthplace ([Micah 5:2](https://www.bibleref.com/Micah/5/Micah-5-2.html)), lineage ([Genesis 49:10](https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/49/Genesis-49-10.html)), and purpose ([Isaiah 53:5](https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/53/Isaiah-53-5.html)). Jesus fulfilled each of these prophecies with precision. He was born in Bethlehem ([Matthew 2:1-6](https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/2/Matthew-2-1.html)), descended from King David ([Luke 1:32-33](https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/1/Luke-1-32.html)), and offered Himself as the ultimate sacrifice for sin ([1 Peter 2:24](https://www.bibleref.com/1-Peter/2/1-Peter-2-24.html)). Through His life, death, and resurrection, Jesus accomplished what was foretold in the Old Testament.

### Think About It

The fulfillment of prophecies concerning Jesus' birth, life, death, and resurrection demonstrates the divine orchestration of God's plan. It affirms that Jesus is the long-awaited Messiah promised throughout the Old Testament. Reflecting on the fulfillment of these prophecies strengthens our faith in God's sovereignty and His faithfulness to fulfill His promises.

### Jesus' Name in Different Languages

Jesus came into the world to offer salvation and forgiveness to everyone who calls upon His name. The Bible declares that whoever believes in Him will not perish but have eternal life ([John 3:16-18](https://www.bibleref.com/John/3/John-3-16.html)). It is important to note that God is not offended by our languages or our differences. Throughout the Bible, Yahweh identified Himself by different names as He interacted with people in various ways. Jesus referred to Himself as the "Son of Man" ([Matthew 26:24](https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/26/Matthew-26-24.html); [Luke 22:22](https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/22/Luke-22-22.html)), and others addressed Him as "Teacher" ([Matthew 8:19](https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/8/Matthew-8-19.html)) and "Rabbi" ([John 1:49](https://www.bibleref.com/John/1/John-1-49.html)). Jesus never corrected anyone's pronunciation or use of a messianic title as long as they came to Him in faith.

### Why This Matters

The name we use when we come to Jesus in faith appears to be unimportant to Him. He hears our hearts regardless of the words our mouths speak ([Luke 9:47](https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/9/Luke-9-47.html)). There is power in the name of Jesus, not in its pronunciation but in the person to whom it refers – our Lord, Redeemer, and King. Therefore, we should not be ashamed to use the name Jesus in our prayers, worship, and witness. If we desire to connect with the Jewishness of our Messiah, we can refer to Him by His original name, Yeshua. However, it is crucial to remember that our salvation is not dependent on the pronunciation of a particular name but on our relationship with Jesus Christ.

### Think About It

The significance of Jesus' name lies not in its pronunciation but in the person behind it. Rather than getting caught up in debates about the correct way to say His name, let us focus on our relationship with Him. Our faith should be grounded in the person of Jesus and the salvation He offers, rather than in specific linguistic details. Let us worship and serve Him with reverence and love, knowing that He is the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies and the Savior of all who believe in Him.

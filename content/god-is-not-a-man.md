Title: 'Divine Truth Revealed: God Is Not a Man'
---

## God is not a man

The claim that Jesus cannot be God because the Old Testament states that "God is not a man" (Numbers 23:19a) has caused confusion and debate among some. However, when we carefully examine the biblical text, we find that Jesus himself claimed to be both the Son of God and the Son of Man. This unique claim, known as the hypostatic union, means that Jesus is fully God and fully human. While we may not fully understand this union, we can choose to believe in Jesus based on his own words.

### The Old Testament's contrast between God and man

When the Old Testament declares that "God is not a man," it is emphasizing that God does not lie or change like human beings do. It is highlighting the difference between God's unchanging nature and the flaws and limitations of humanity. This contrast does not restrict God from becoming a man in a different way. In fact, God had planned for redemption through the incarnation of Jesus even before [Numbers 23:19](https://www.bibleref.com/Numbers/23/Numbers-23-19.html) was written.

### Progressive revelation

Understanding the Bible requires recognizing that God reveals His truth progressively over time. He has unfolded His purposes sequentially throughout history. For example, in the Garden of Eden, Adam and Eve did not need to know about redemption until after they sinned. Similarly, the full meaning of certain Old Testament prophecies only became clear with the coming of Jesus.

### The New Testament reveals Jesus as both God and man

The New Testament provides further revelation about Jesus' identity as both God and man. While the Old Testament foreshadows this truth, it is in the New Testament that we see it fully revealed. John the Baptist's prophecies and the miracles performed by Jesus serve as signs to prove his divine nature. Those who respond in faith to these signs acknowledge Jesus as the Messiah, the Son of God.

### Why This Matters

Understanding Jesus' identity is crucial to our faith as Christians. If we deny Jesus' divinity, we undermine the foundation of our belief in salvation through his sacrifice on the cross. Recognizing Jesus as fully God and fully human allows us to experience the depth of God's love and the power of his redemptive work.

### Think About It

Consider the implications of Jesus being both God and man. How does this impact your understanding of God's character and his plan for redemption? Reflect on the significance of Jesus' miracles as signs of his divine nature. How does this strengthen your faith in him as the Messiah?

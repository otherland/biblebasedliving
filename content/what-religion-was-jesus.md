Title: Was Jesus a Christian? Exploring His Religious Identity
---

## What Religion Was Jesus?

Jesus, the central figure of Christianity, was born into a Jewish family and grew up in a Jewish community that followed the Jewish law. His lineage can be traced back to the tribe of Judah, one of the twelve tribes of Israel. The town of Bethlehem was his birthplace, and he was raised in Nazareth. Therefore, it is safe to say that Jesus was deeply immersed in Jewish culture, nationality, and religion.

### The Practice of Judaism

During his time on earth, Jesus practiced the religion of first-century Judaism. He was "born under the law" ([Galatians 4:4](https://www.bibleref.com/Galatians/4/Galatians-4-4.html)) and adhered to the teachings of the Torah. He not only obeyed the Mosaic Law but also fulfilled it, bringing its requirements to a close ([Matthew 5:17](https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/5/Matthew-5-17.html)–18; [Romans 10:4](https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/10/Romans-10-4.html)).

#### Observance of Feasts and Festivals

Jesus and his disciples observed various Jewish feasts and festivals. For example, they celebrated the Passover ([John 2:13](https://www.bibleref.com/John/2/John-2-13.html), 23; [Luke 22:7](https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/22/Luke-22-7.html)–8) and the Feast of Tabernacles ([John 7:2](https://www.bibleref.com/John/7/John-7-2.html), 10). In addition, there are references to Jesus attending an unnamed Jewish feast in [John 5:1](https://www.bibleref.com/John/5/John-5-1.html). This demonstrates his participation in Jewish religious traditions.

#### Synagogue Attendance and Teaching

Jesus regularly attended worship services and taught in synagogues ([Mark 1:21](https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/1/Mark-1-21.html); 3:1; [John 6:59](https://www.bibleref.com/John/6/John-6-59.html); 18:20). His presence in these settings highlights his involvement in Jewish religious life. Furthermore, he respected the scribes and Pharisees who taught the Law as it was understood during his time ([Matthew 23:1](https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/23/Matthew-23-1.html)–3).

#### Knowledge of Scriptures

Jesus frequently quoted from the Tanakh (the Hebrew Bible) during his teachings (e.g., [Mark 12:28](https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/12/Mark-12-28.html)–31; [Luke 4:4](https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/4/Luke-4-4.html), 8, 12). This demonstrates his familiarity with and reliance on Jewish scriptures. Jesus upheld the importance of these sacred texts and incorporated their teachings into his own messages.

### Jesus and His Religion

It is important to note that Jesus did not deviate from the religious observances of Judaism. When addressing a group of Jews, he challenged them by asking, "Can any of you prove me guilty of sin?" ([John 8:46](https://www.bibleref.com/John/8/John-8-46.html)). If Jesus had departed from the religious practices of Judaism, his adversaries would have undoubtedly used this as an opportunity to condemn him. However, throughout his life, Jesus consistently adhered to Jewish customs and traditions.

#### Condemnation of Religious Leaders

While Jesus criticized the religious leaders of his day, it is crucial to understand that his condemnation was not directed at the Jewish religion itself. Instead, he condemned those who taught man-made ideas as commands from God ([Matthew 15:9](https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/15/Matthew-15-9.html), NLT). Jesus sought to purify Judaism by challenging corrupt practices and hypocrisy.

#### The Fulfillment of the Law

Jesus' purpose was not to destroy Judaism but to fulfill it. He perfectly followed the Law and brought it to completion. His death marked the end of the Old Covenant God had made with Israel, as symbolized by the tearing of the temple veil ([Mark 15:38](https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/15/Mark-15-38.html)), and established the New Covenant ([Luke 22:20](https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/22/Luke-22-20.html)).

### The Early Church and Judaism

The early Christian church had its roots in Judaism and Jewish messianism. The earliest followers of Christ were predominantly Jewish. However, as they proclaimed Jesus as the long-awaited Messiah, many Jews rejected this message. Consequently, the early believers were forced to separate themselves from mainstream Judaism (see [Acts 13:45](https://www.bibleref.com/Acts/13/Acts-13-45.html)–47).

### Why This Matters

Understanding that Jesus was raised in and practiced first-century Judaism provides important context for interpreting his teachings and actions. It highlights the continuity between Jewish religious traditions and the emergence of Christianity. Recognizing Jesus' Jewish background can deepen our appreciation for his fulfillment of the Law and the significance of his sacrificial death.

### Think About It

1. How does knowing that Jesus practiced Judaism inform your understanding of his teachings?
2. How might Jesus' Jewish background affect your perspective on the relationship between Christianity and Judaism?
3. In what ways can Jesus' observance of Jewish customs and traditions inspire Christians to appreciate their own religious heritage?

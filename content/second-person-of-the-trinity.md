## Second Person of the Trinity

The concept of the Trinity refers to the belief that there is one God who exists in three distinct persons. The Bible teaches that these three persons, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, are coexistent and co-eternal. Jesus is considered the second person of the Trinity because he is mentioned second in the "Trinitarian formula" found in [Matthew 28:19](https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/28/Matthew-28-19.html). This formula is used in the Great Commission, where Jesus instructs his disciples to baptize new believers "in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit."

It is important to note that using terms like first, second, and third when referring to the persons of the Trinity does not imply a difference in their importance. The Athanasian Creed, an early summary of Christian doctrine on the Trinity, emphasizes that while there are three distinct persons, they share the same nature and substance. The creed states, "There is one Person of the Father, another of the Son, and another of the Holy Spirit. But the godhead of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, is all one, the glory equal, the majesty co-eternal... In the Trinity none is before or after another; none is greater or less than another, but all three Persons are co-eternal together and co-equal."

Although Jesus is not inferior to the Father, he willingly submitted himself to the Father's will. He is called the second person of the Trinity because he took on human nature and lived in total obedience to God the Father. [Philippians 2:6-8](https://www.bibleref.com/Philippians/2/Philippians-2-6.html) describes this submission: "Who, being in very nature God, did not consider equality with God something to be used to his own advantage; rather, he made himself nothing by taking the very nature of a servant, being made in human likeness. And being found in appearance as a man, he humbled himself by becoming obedient to death—even death on a cross!" In the "economic Trinity," which refers to how God has revealed himself and interacts with humanity, Jesus holds a second position.

Through his obedience as the Son, Jesus accomplished our salvation and is now exalted at the right hand of the Father. [Hebrews 1:3](https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/1/Hebrews-1-3.html) affirms this: "The Son is the radiance of God’s glory and the exact representation of his being, sustaining all things by his powerful word. After he had provided purification for sins, he sat down at the right hand of the Majesty in heaven."

### Why This Matters

Understanding the concept of the second person of the Trinity is essential to grasp the fullness of God's revelation and his plan of salvation. By recognizing Jesus as the second person in the Trinity, we acknowledge his divine nature and his role in our redemption. It also helps us appreciate the depth of his humility and obedience in taking on human form and submitting to God's will. Recognizing Jesus' exaltation to the right hand of the Father reminds us of his authority and power over all things.

### Think About It

Consider the significance of Jesus willingly submitting himself to God's plan of salvation. How does this act of humility impact your understanding of who Jesus is and what he has done for you? How does recognizing Jesus as the second person of the Trinity shape your perspective on his authority and role in your life? Take a moment to reflect on these truths and thank God for sending Jesus to redeem you.

## The Divinity of Christ

The divinity of Jesus Christ is a central belief within Christianity. Throughout the New Testament, Jesus is not only presented as the Messiah but also equated with God Himself. The apostle Paul, in his letters, refers to Jesus as our "great God and Savior" ([Titus 2:13](https://www.bibleref.com/Titus/2/Titus-2-13.html)) and asserts that Jesus existed in the "form of God" before His incarnation ([Philippians 2:5-8](https://www.bibleref.com/Philippians/2/Philippians-2-5.html)). The book of Hebrews declares, "Your throne, O God, will last forever and ever" ([Hebrews 1:8](https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/1/Hebrews-1-8.html)), attributing divine authority to Jesus. Additionally, Jesus is directly identified as the Creator ([John 1:3](https://www.bibleref.com/John/1/John-1-3.html); [Colossians 1:16-17](https://www.bibleref.com/Colossians/1/Colossians-1-16.html)) and other passages in the Bible affirm His deity ([Revelation 1:7](https://www.bibleref.com/Revelation/1/Revelation-1-7.html); 2:8; [1 Corinthians 10:4](https://www.bibleref.com/1-Corinthians/10/1-Corinthians-10-4.html); [1 Peter 5:4](https://www.bibleref.com/1-Peter/5/1-Peter-5-4.html)).

### Jesus as the Son of Man

One particular self-designation of Jesus that provides evidence for His divinity is "Son of Man." This title appears multiple times in all four Gospels, indicating that it was used by Jesus Himself. In Mark 14, during His trial before the High Priest, Jesus claims to be the Son of Man from Daniel's vision. In [Daniel 7:13-14](https://www.bibleref.com/Daniel/7/Daniel-7-13.html), it is stated that this Son of Man would be given dominion, glory, and an everlasting kingdom.

By referring to Himself as the Son of Man, Jesus associates Himself with this figure who possesses everlasting power and a unique authority beyond that of a mere human being. The use of this title by Jesus is significant because it is unlikely that it would have been attributed to Him if He had not used it himself. Thus, the self-designation "Son of Man" provides compelling evidence for Jesus' divine self-understanding.

### Actions and Worship

Jesus' actions and the worship He receives also point to His divinity. In Mark 2, Jesus heals a paralytic man not only to demonstrate His authority but also to show that He has the power to forgive sins. By forgiving sins, Jesus is assuming a divine prerogative that was traditionally reserved for God alone. This act challenges the Jewish audience's understanding of who Jesus is and indicates His divine nature.

Furthermore, Jesus receives worship from various individuals and groups throughout the Gospels. He does not reject their worship but rather accepts it as appropriate. This acceptance of worship implies that Jesus understood Himself to be worthy of worship, which aligns with divine status. Jesus' teachings also emphasize His role as the judge of humanity and the importance of one's response to Him for their eternal destiny. These teachings further support Jesus' divine self-understanding.

### The Resurrection

The resurrection of Jesus serves as a powerful confirmation of His claims to divinity. After being crucified and buried, Jesus rose from the dead, establishing His authority and validating His teachings. Numerous contemporary sources report Jesus' post-resurrection appearances to individuals and groups under various circumstances.

The fact that many witnesses were willing to die for their belief in Jesus' resurrection adds credibility to this event. The theories proposed to explain away the resurrection, such as the Hallucination Theory, have failed to account for all the known data. The resurrection of Jesus is an established historical fact and serves as the strongest evidence for His divinity.

### Why This Matters

Understanding the divinity of Christ is essential for Christians as it forms the foundation of their faith. Believing in Jesus as fully divine affirms His role as Savior and Lord. It demonstrates that salvation comes through faith in Him alone and acknowledges Him as the ultimate authority in our lives.

Recognizing Jesus' divinity also provides assurance of His power and ability to forgive sins. It assures believers that Jesus is not merely a moral teacher or a good example but a divine being who has the authority to offer forgiveness and grant eternal life.

### Think About It

Contemplating the divinity of Christ challenges us to consider the implications of who Jesus claimed to be. If Jesus truly is divine, then our response to Him is of utmost importance. It calls us to examine our beliefs, attitudes, and actions in light of His teachings and to surrender our lives to Him as our Lord and Savior.

The divinity of Christ also invites us to reflect on the significance of His resurrection. If Jesus conquered death and rose from the dead, it validates His claims and offers hope for eternal life. It prompts us to consider the reality of life beyond this world and the importance of our relationship with Him.

Ultimately, the divinity of Christ is a foundational belief that shapes the Christian faith. It is through understanding and embracing this truth that we can experience the fullness of salvation, forgiveness, and eternal life in Him.

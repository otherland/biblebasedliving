## Jesus Christ Superstar: A Retelling of the Final Days of Jesus

The rock opera Jesus Christ Superstar, composed by Andrew Lloyd Webber and written by Tim Rice, as well as the film adaptation directed by Norman Jewison, offers a unique retelling of the story of Jesus Christ's final days. Although the opera contains elements of the biblical narrative, it also introduces reinterpretations and reimaginations of the characters and their motivations.

### Jesus and Judas: Reimagined Characters

In Jesus Christ Superstar, Judas takes on a prominent role. He opens the opera with a song expressing his frustration with Jesus, accusing Him of becoming consumed by His own fame. Judas suggests that Jesus' followers are blind and twists His words. This notion is later echoed by Mary Magdalene, who questions her understanding of how to love Jesus. The opera presents a recurring theme that portrays Jesus as just a man, stripping away His divinity.

Throughout the story, Judas expresses concern about Jesus' popularity and warns Him about potential scandals. He emphasizes the mission to help the poor, contrasting Mary's devotion to Jesus with his focus on social action. Notably, Judas' greed and thievery are not mentioned in this retelling.

Jesus is portrayed as a character who has become overwhelmed by His own fame. He questions His original vision and contemplates martyrdom for personal recognition. This portrayal contrasts sharply with the biblical account of Jesus' unwavering commitment to fulfilling God's plan for salvation.

### Departures from Biblical Accounts

While some aspects of Jesus Christ Superstar align with the biblical narrative, there are significant deviations that alter the overall message. In the opera, Jesus enters Jerusalem amid celebration, but the praise appears less spontaneous than in the Bible. Jesus initiates singing at times and even commands the crowd to perform. This contrasts with the biblical account where adoration erupts organically.

The opera also overlooks Jesus' teachings about the Kingdom of God and the promise of eternal life. Instead, Jesus speaks briefly about winning the kingdom, leaving out crucial elements of His message.

Furthermore, the portrayal of the Last Supper in Jesus Christ Superstar emphasizes the disciples' desire for lasting fame rather than focusing on Jesus' institution of the Lord's Supper. Jesus accuses His disciples of not caring about Him and expresses doubts about being remembered. This strays from the biblical account where Jesus instructs His disciples to remember Him through the observance of Communion.

### The Crucifixion and Resurrection

In Jesus Christ Superstar, the opera concludes with Jesus' crucifixion, omitting any mention of His resurrection. This omission is significant because the resurrection is a central tenet of Christian faith and essential to understanding Jesus' victory over sin and death.

The opera's final song, sung by Judas, suggests that Jesus' appeal lies in how He died, likening Him to other religious figures such as Buddha and Mohammed. The focus on Jesus as a martyr overlooks His divinity and undermines the significance of His sacrificial death and subsequent resurrection.

## Why This Matters

Jesus Christ Superstar presents a reinterpretation of the biblical narrative that challenges core Christian beliefs about Jesus' divinity, purpose, and resurrection. By portraying Jesus as a flawed human driven by his own fame, the opera undermines the central message of Christianity: that Jesus is the Son of God who willingly sacrificed Himself to redeem humanity.

Understanding these departures from biblical accounts is crucial for Christians seeking to discern truth from artistic interpretation. It highlights the importance of biblical literacy and discernment when engaging with popular culture that references religious themes.

## Think About It

1. How does the portrayal of Jesus in Jesus Christ Superstar differ from your understanding of Him based on biblical accounts? How does this affect your perception of His divinity and purpose?
2. The omission of Jesus' resurrection in the opera is significant. Why is the resurrection such a foundational belief in Christianity? How does it impact your faith?
3. What can Christians learn from engaging with artistic interpretations of religious narratives? How can we navigate the tension between artistic creativity and biblical fidelity?

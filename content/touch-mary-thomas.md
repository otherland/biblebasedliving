## Touching Jesus: Understanding the Words to Mary Thomas

In the Gospel of John, there are two instances where Jesus speaks about touching Him: once to Mary Magdalene and later to Thomas. At first glance, these statements may seem contradictory, but a closer examination reveals that Jesus used different words and addressed different situations. Let's explore these encounters to gain a deeper understanding.

### Mary's Clinging Touch

When Jesus appeared to Mary Magdalene after His resurrection, He told her, "Touch Me not" ([John 20:17](https://www.bibleref.com/John/20/John-20-17.html), KJV). The Greek word used here for "touch" implies more than a simple touch; it conveys the idea of clinging or laying hold of. Mary's reaction upon recognizing Jesus was to immediately cling to Him, as did the other women who saw the resurrected Christ ([Matthew 28:9](https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/28/Matthew-28-9.html)).

Mary's response can be attributed to several factors. First and foremost, it stemmed from her deep love and devotion for the Lord. Overwhelmed by the events of that morning, her grief turned into joy, prompting her to embrace Jesus. Secondly, Mary desired to restore the fellowship that death had temporarily broken. Having lost Him once before, she longed to hold on to Jesus and keep Him with her always. Additionally, Mary may have believed that this was the fulfillment of Jesus' promise to return ([John 14:3](https://www.bibleref.com/John/14/John-14-3.html)), which would entail taking her and all believers to heaven.

However, Jesus had a different plan. He intended to ascend to the Father and send the Holy Spirit ([John 16:7](https://www.bibleref.com/John/16/John-16-7.html); 20:22; [Acts 2:1-4](https://www.bibleref.com/Acts/2/Acts-2-1.html)). While fellowship with Jesus would continue, it would be in the form of spiritual communion rather than physical presence. By gently asking Mary to release her grip on Him, Jesus was essentially saying, "I understand your desire to keep me here with you always, but our relationship is about to change. I am going to heaven, and the Holy Spirit will come to be with you. You need to start walking by faith, not by sight."

### Thomas' Doubting Touch

In contrast to Mary, Thomas expressed doubt about Jesus' resurrection. He declared that he would not believe unless he could physically touch Jesus' body ([John 20:25](https://www.bibleref.com/John/20/John-20-25.html)). Jesus, aware of Thomas' words, offered His body as living proof of His resurrection. This was not the first time Jesus had done so; He had also shown His wounds to His disciples on another occasion ([Luke 24:39-40](https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/24/Luke-24-39.html)).

Both Mary and Thomas needed to grow in faith. Mary needed the faith to let go of Jesus physically, trusting in His promise of the Holy Spirit's presence. On the other hand, Thomas needed the faith to believe without empirical proof. Jesus provided what both of them needed.

### Why This Matters

These encounters between Jesus, Mary Magdalene, and Thomas have significant implications for believers today. They highlight the importance of faith and trust in Jesus' words even when we cannot physically see or touch Him. We must learn to rely on the indwelling presence of the Holy Spirit and walk by faith, not by sight.

### Think About It

1. How does Mary's reaction to seeing the resurrected Jesus reflect her love and devotion for Him?
2. In what ways did Jesus assure Mary that their relationship would continue despite His physical absence?
3. What can we learn from Thomas' doubts and Jesus' response? How does this apply to our own doubts and need for faith?

As we reflect on these encounters, let us seek to deepen our faith and trust in Jesus. May we learn from Mary's willingness to let go physically and trust in the Holy Spirit's presence, as well as from Thomas' journey from doubt to belief.

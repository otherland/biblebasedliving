## God is Good

God's goodness is an essential aspect of His nature. The Bible tells us that "God is light; in Him, there is no darkness at all" ([1 John 1:5](https://www.bibleref.com/1-John/1/1-John-1-5.html)). This means that God always acts according to what is right, true, and good. His goodness is inherent and cannot be separated from Him. God is the standard of all that is good.

### The Nature of God's Goodness

God's goodness means that He has no evil within Him. His intentions and motivations are always good, and He consistently does what is right. The outcome of His plan is always good as well ([Genesis 50:20](https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/50/Genesis-50-20.html)). God's goodness extends from His nature to everything He does ([Psalm 119:68](https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/119/Psalm-119-68.html)). It is a fundamental part of who He is.

### God's Creation and Goodness

Everything that God created was initially good ([Genesis 1:31](https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/1/Genesis-1-31.html)). God's goodness is evident in the beauty and harmony of His creation. He can only create what is good because He Himself is fully good. Evil, on the other hand, is the absence of goodness and anything contrary to God's nature ([Habakkuk 1:13](https://www.bibleref.com/Habakkuk/1/Habakkuk-1-13.html); [1 John 1:5](https://www.bibleref.com/1-John/1/1-John-1-5.html)).

### The Law as a Reflection of God's Goodness

God's goodness is showcased in the Law He gave to Israel. The Law is holy, righteous, and good ([Romans 7:12](https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/7/Romans-7-12.html)). It reflects God's character and reveals His standards for righteousness and justice. The Law was given for the well-being and benefit of His people.

### Thankfulness for God's Goodness

God's goodness should lead us to thankfulness. We are encouraged to give thanks to the Lord because He is good ([Psalm 107:1](https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/107/Psalm-107-1.html)). However, people often choose to reject or ignore God's goodness due to their sinful nature ([John 3:19](https://www.bibleref.com/John/3/John-3-19.html)). In the Old Testament, the Israelites repeatedly forgot God's goodness and turned away from Him ([Psalm 78:11](https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/78/Psalm-78-11.html)).

### God's Goodness and Redemption

God's goodness is most clearly seen in His plan to redeem humanity from sin. The gospel is the "good news" that God sent His Son as the perfect sacrifice to forgive our sins. God desires that all people come to repentance and experience His goodness ([2 Peter 3:9](https://www.bibleref.com/2-Peter/3/2-Peter-3-9.html); [Romans 2:4](https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/2/Romans-2-4.html)). Through Jesus, we can taste and see that the Lord is good ([Psalm 34:8](https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/34/Psalm-34-8.html)).

### Why This Matters

Understanding and acknowledging God's goodness is crucial for our relationship with Him. It helps us recognize His love, faithfulness, and righteousness. Knowing that God is good gives us hope and assurance in times of difficulty, knowing that He works all things for our ultimate good ([Romans 8:28](https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/8/Romans-8-28.html)). It also challenges us to respond with gratitude and obedience.

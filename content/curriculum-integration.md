## Curriculum Integration: A Conservative Christian Perspective
Curriculum integration is a topic that has gained significant attention in education circles in recent years. It refers to the practice of combining different subjects or disciplines when teaching a particular topic or theme. From a conservative Christian perspective, curriculum integration raises important questions about how to approach the teaching of various subjects in light of biblical truth and values. In this article, we will explore [eight key questions](/academic-recognition-creationisn) related to curriculum integration from a staunchly conservative, biblical viewpoint.

## 1. What is the purpose of curriculum integration?

Curriculum integration should be driven by the desire to provide a holistic educational experience rooted in biblical truth. The purpose is not simply to combine subjects for the sake of convenience or novelty but rather to help students see the interconnectedness of God's creation and understand how different subjects point to His glory and wisdom. By integrating curriculum, we can foster a deeper understanding of the world and equip students to think critically and biblically about all areas of life.

**Biblical Foundation:**

> "The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge; fools despise wisdom and instruction." ([Proverbs 1:7](https://www.bibleref.com/Proverbs/1/Proverbs-1-7.html))

> "For from him and through him and to him are all things. To him be glory forever. Amen." ([Romans 11:36](https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/11/Romans-11-36.html))

## 2. How does curriculum integration align with biblical principles?

Curriculum integration aligns with biblical principles by acknowledging that all truth is ultimately God's truth. By bringing different subjects together, we can help students see how they are interconnected and how they ultimately point back to God as the source of all knowledge and wisdom. Moreover, curriculum integration provides an opportunity to teach students about the unity and coherence of God's creation, reinforcing the biblical truth that everything was created by Him and for Him.

**Biblical Foundation:**

> "For by him all things were created, in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or rulers or authorities—all things were created through him and for him." ([Colossians 1:16](https://www.bibleref.com/Colossians/1/Colossians-1-16.html))

> "In him are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge." ([Colossians 2:3](https://www.bibleref.com/Colossians/2/Colossians-2-3.html))

## 3. How can curriculum integration be implemented in a way that upholds biblical values?

Curriculum integration should be approached with discernment to ensure that it upholds biblical values. It is important to critically evaluate the content and materials used in the integration process to ensure they align with biblical truth. Teachers should prioritize teaching from a biblical worldview, presenting different perspectives or theories in light of Scripture. By doing so, we can equip students to think critically and discerningly, evaluating ideas and concepts in light of God's Word.

**Biblical Foundation:**

> "Do not conform to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind. Then you will be able to test and approve what God’s will is—his good, pleasing and perfect will." ([Romans 12:2](https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/12/Romans-12-2.html))

> "See to it that no one takes you captive through hollow and deceptive philosophy, which depends on human tradition and the elemental spiritual forces of this world rather than on Christ." ([Colossians 2:8](https://www.bibleref.com/Colossians/2/Colossians-2-8.html))

## 4. How can curriculum integration promote a biblical worldview?

Curriculum integration can promote a biblical worldview by intentionally incorporating biblical principles, values, and narratives into the teaching of various subjects. This can be done by selecting literature, historical events, scientific concepts, and other subject matter that align with biblical truth. By integrating these elements into the curriculum, students can develop a deeper understanding of how different subjects relate to their faith and how they can live out their faith in every area of life.

**Biblical Foundation:**

> "Finally, brothers and sisters, whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable—if anything is excellent or praiseworthy—think about such things." ([Philippians 4:8](https://www.bibleref.com/Philippians/4/Philippians-4-8.html))

> "But in your hearts revere Christ as Lord. Always be prepared to give an answer to everyone who asks you to give the reason for the hope that you have. But do this with gentleness and respect." ([1 Peter 3:15](https://www.bibleref.com/1-Peter/3/1-Peter-3-15.html))

## 5. What are the potential challenges of curriculum integration from a conservative Christian perspective?

One potential challenge of curriculum integration from a [conservative Christian perspective](/limiting-islamic-visibility) is the need for discernment when selecting materials and resources. Not all resources align with biblical truth, and teachers must carefully vet them to ensure they do not compromise biblical values. Additionally, there may be resistance or opposition from secular ideologies that seek to undermine or dismiss biblical perspectives. Teachers must be prepared to navigate these challenges while remaining faithful to biblical principles.

**[
According to Leslie Owen Wilson's "The Second Principle," curriculum integration requires a willingness to learn about other disciplines and fully understand their perspectives. This approach enables educators to explore new possibilities and create interesting fusions that align with a biblical worldview.

## 6. How can faith be integrated into curriculum alongside secular subjects?

Integrating faith into curriculum alongside secular subjects involves intentionally infusing biblical truths, values, and principles into the teaching of different subjects. This can be done by incorporating [relevant Bible verses](/prayer-of-hopelessness), discussing moral implications and ethical considerations from a biblical standpoint, and encouraging students to think critically about how their faith intersects with the subject matter at hand. By integrating faith in this way, students can develop a deeper understanding of how their faith informs all aspects of their lives.

**Biblical Foundation:**

> "Trust in the LORD with [all your heart](/scripture-prayers-for-pastors), and do not lean on your own understanding. In [all your ways](/devotional-resources) acknowledge him, and he will make straight your paths." ([Proverbs 3:5-6](https://www.bibleref.com/Proverbs/3/Proverbs-3-5.html))

> "And whatever you do, whether in word or deed, do it all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through him." ([Colossians 3:17](https://www.bibleref.com/Colossians/3/Colossians-3-17.html))

## 7. How can curriculum integration address controversial topics from a biblical perspective?

Curriculum integration provides an opportunity to address controversial topics from a biblical perspective by presenting different viewpoints and encouraging students to engage in critical thinking and respectful dialogue. Teachers can guide students to analyze these topics through the lens of Scripture, discussing biblical principles and values that relate to the issue at hand. By doing so, students can develop a biblical worldview that informs their understanding of controversial topics.


According to the research study "ULINCS: An Integrated Learning Experience with University Faculty, Teachers, and Students," curriculum integration can be used to combine different content standards into synthesized standards that integrate literacy and math within the context of science. This approach demonstrates how curriculum integration can support student achievement while upholding biblical values.

## 8. How can curriculum integration enhance students' understanding of God's creation?

Curriculum integration enhances students' understanding of God's creation by helping them see how different subjects point to His wisdom, beauty, and order. By exploring the interconnectedness of various disciplines, students gain a deeper appreciation for the complexity and intricacy of God's creation. Curriculum integration also encourages students to explore the wonders of God's world with a sense of awe and reverence.

**Biblical Foundation:**

> "The heavens declare the glory of God; the skies proclaim the work of his hands." ([Psalm 19:1](https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/19/Psalm-19-1.html))

> "For since the creation of the world God’s invisible qualities—[his eternal power](/scientific-research-creationism) and divine nature—have been clearly seen, being understood from what has been made, so that people are without excuse." ([Romans 1:20](https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/1/Romans-1-20.html))

In conclusion, curriculum integration from a conservative Christian perspective seeks to provide a holistic educational experience rooted in biblical truth. By integrating different subjects and intentionally infusing them with biblical principles, values, and narratives, we can equip students to think critically and discerningly while deepening their understanding of God's creation. Curriculum integration offers an opportunity to cultivate a biblical worldview and nurture students' faith in all areas of life.

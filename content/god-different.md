Title: Discovering God's Unique and Transformative Differences

## God in the Old and New Testaments

When discussing the nature of God, some may suggest that the God of the Old Testament is different from the God of the New Testament. This misconception often stems from a misunderstanding of how God's character is revealed throughout both testaments. However, upon closer examination of the Bible, it becomes evident that God's attributes, including His love and wrath, are consistently portrayed in both the Old and New Testaments.

### God's Love and Wrath Revealed

Throughout the Old Testament, God is repeatedly described as compassionate, gracious, and abounding in love and faithfulness ([Exodus 34:6](https://www.bibleref.com/Exodus/34/Exodus-34-6.html); [Numbers 14:18](https://www.bibleref.com/Numbers/14/Numbers-14-18.html); [Deuteronomy 4:31](https://www.bibleref.com/Deuteronomy/4/Deuteronomy-4-31.html); [Nehemiah 9:17](https://www.bibleref.com/Nehemiah/9/Nehemiah-9-17.html); [Psalm 86:5](https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/86/Psalm-86-5.html), 15; 108:4; 145:8; [Joel 2:13](https://www.bibleref.com/Joel/2/Joel-2-13.html)). This loving-kindness and mercy are further exemplified in the New Testament through the ultimate expression of God's love—sending His Son Jesus Christ as an atoning sacrifice for our sins ([John 3:16](https://www.bibleref.com/John/3/John-3-16.html); [1 John 4:10](https://www.bibleref.com/1-John/4/1-John-4-10.html)).

In both testaments, we also witness God's response to rebellion and sin. In the Old Testament, when the Israelites turned away from Him to worship idols, God would discipline them. However, He would always deliver them after they repented ([Hebrews 12:6](https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/12/Hebrews-12-6.html)). Similarly, in the New Testament, we see that God's wrath is still being revealed against godlessness and wickedness ([Romans 1:18](https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/1/Romans-1-18.html)).

### God's Unchanging Nature

It is important to understand that while certain aspects of God's nature may be emphasized in specific passages, God Himself does not change. The Bible consistently portrays God as immutable or unchanging ([James 1:17](https://www.bibleref.com/James/1/James-1-17.html)). Despite being written by multiple authors over a span of approximately 1500 years, in different languages and on different continents, the Bible remains one unified book without contradictions. God's love for His creation, especially mankind, is evident throughout Scripture.

### The Sacrificial System and Jesus Christ

In the Old Testament, God established a sacrificial system as a temporary means of atonement for sin. However, this system merely foreshadowed the ultimate expression of God's love—the coming of Jesus Christ. In the New Testament, we witness the fulfillment of these promises, as Jesus dies on the cross to make a complete substitutionary atonement for sin.

### Why This Matters

Understanding the consistency of God's character throughout the Old and New Testaments is crucial for our faith. It reassures us that God's love, mercy, and justice remain unchanged. Recognizing this continuity strengthens our trust in His promises and His plan for salvation through Jesus Christ.

### Think About It

Consider how your understanding of God's nature in both the Old and New Testaments impacts your relationship with Him. Reflect on the unchanging love and justice He displays and how that influences your faith journey.

Title: Does God Get Angry? Understanding Divine Wrath in Christianity
---

## Does God Get Angry?

The Bible clearly indicates that God does get angry. However, it is important to understand that God's anger is different from our human experience of anger. [Ephesians 4:26-27](https://www.bibleref.com/Ephesians/4/Ephesians-4-26.html) tells us that it is possible to experience anger without sinning. Since God cannot sin, we know that His anger is righteous unlike the common experience of anger in ourselves.

### The Nature of God's Anger

God's anger is a response to the violation of His character. He is righteous, just, and holy, and none of these attributes can be compromised. When the nation of Israel and its kings turned away from obeying Him, God became angry ([1 Kings 11:9-10](https://www.bibleref.com/1-Kings/11/1-Kings-11-9.html); [2 Kings 17:18](https://www.bibleref.com/2-Kings/17/2-Kings-17-18.html)). The wicked practices of the nations in Canaan also aroused God's anger to the point where He commanded Israel to destroy them completely ([Deuteronomy 7:1-6](https://www.bibleref.com/Deuteronomy/7/Deuteronomy-7-1.html)). Just as a parent becomes angry at anything that would harm their children, God's anger is directed at that which would harm His people and their relationship with Him.

### God's Motivation in Anger

Even in His anger, God's motivation is love for people. He desires to restore the relationship that sin has destroyed. He takes no pleasure in the death of the wicked, but rather desires that they turn from their ways and live ([Ezekiel 33:11](https://www.bibleref.com/Ezekiel/33/Ezekiel-33-11.html)). In the New Testament, Jesus also displayed anger towards the religious teachers and leaders who used religion for personal gain and kept people in bondage ([John 2:13-16](https://www.bibleref.com/John/2/John-2-13.html); [Mark 3:4-5](https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/3/Mark-3-4.html)).

### The Role of Jesus

For those who have accepted Jesus as Lord and Savior, they are no longer under God's wrath for sin. Jesus experienced the full measure of God's wrath on the cross so that we wouldn't have to. This is known as propitiation, or satisfaction. Through Jesus' sacrifice, the righteous requirement of the law is fully met in us ([Romans 8:1-4](https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/8/Romans-8-1.html)). Therefore, there is no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus.

### Why This Matters

Understanding that God gets angry can help us grasp the seriousness of sin and its consequences. It reminds us of the importance of living in obedience to God's commands and seeking His forgiveness when we fall short. God's anger also highlights His love for us and His desire to restore our relationship with Him. It demonstrates the depth of His sacrifice through Jesus and the freedom we have from condemnation.

### Think About It

Consider how God's anger differs from human anger. Reflect on how God's motivation in anger is rooted in love. How does understanding God's anger impact your view of sin and forgiveness? Meditate on the significance of Jesus' sacrifice as propitiation for our sins.

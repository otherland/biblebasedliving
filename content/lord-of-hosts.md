## Lord of Hosts

The name "LORD of hosts" is found 261 times in the Old Testament Scriptures. It first appears in [1 Samuel 1:3](https://www.bibleref.com/1-Samuel/1/1-Samuel-1-3.html) and refers to Yahweh, the self-existent, redemptive God. The term "hosts" translates the Hebrew word meaning "armies," symbolizing the angelic armies of heaven. Another way to understand "LORD of hosts" is as "God of the armies of heaven." In the NIV translation, it is rendered as "LORD Almighty."

During the period of the judges, when Israel was in a low spiritual state, the name "LORD of hosts" emerges. It is linked to Shiloh, where the Ark of the Covenant was kept, representing Yahweh's rulership. Some suggest that this name reaffirms that God is the true leader of Israel's armies, despite their spiritual condition. In [1 Samuel 17:45](https://www.bibleref.com/1-Samuel/17/1-Samuel-17-45.html), David invokes this name while facing Goliath, declaring that God is the universal ruler over all forces in heaven and on earth.

As Israel enters the international scene after David's victory over Goliath, it becomes crucial for them to recognize that Yahweh is King over all mighty nations. This kingship is beautifully expressed in [Psalm 24:10](https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/24/Psalm-24-10.html): "Who is this King of glory? The LORD of hosts, he is the King of glory!" (ESV). Yahweh will be King over all kingdoms on earth ([Zechariah 14:9](https://www.bibleref.com/Zechariah/14/Zechariah-14-9.html); [Isaiah 37:16](https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/37/Isaiah-37-16.html)).

Ultimately, Yahweh of armies will suppress all rebellion ([Isaiah 24:21](https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/24/Isaiah-24-21.html)–23) and establish His Kingdom from Mount Zion ([Isaiah 31:4](https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/31/Isaiah-31-4.html)–5; 34:12). As the LORD of hosts, God is the all-powerful Ruler over the entire universe. He alone intervenes to grant victory to His people and will bring about world peace. Furthermore, He is available to hear the prayers of His people ([Psalm 80:19](https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/80/Psalm-80-19.html)). There is no other God like Him.

The sovereign LORD of hosts extends His grace to all who approach Him through faith in Jesus Christ. Jesus, the King of glory who commands the armies of heaven and will conquer all His enemies, is none other than the LORD of hosts ([Revelation 19:11](https://www.bibleref.com/Revelation/19/Revelation-19-11.html)–20).

### Why This Matters

It assures us that God is in control, even in times of spiritual decline or when facing formidable challenges in our lives. Recognizing Jesus as the LORD of hosts reminds us that He is the ultimate victor who will defeat all evil and establish His eternal Kingdom.

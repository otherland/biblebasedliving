## The Morning Star

The concept of the morning star is mentioned in the Bible, specifically in [Isaiah 14:12](https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/14/Isaiah-14-12.html) and [Revelation 22:16](https://www.bibleref.com/Revelation/22/Revelation-22-16.html). In [Isaiah 14:12](https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/14/Isaiah-14-12.html), it refers to Satan's fall from heaven: "How you have fallen from heaven, O morning star, son of the dawn! You have been cast down to the earth, you who once laid low the nations!" (NIV). The King James Version (KJV) and New King James Version (NKJV) translate "morning star" as "Lucifer, son of the morning." This passage clearly identifies Satan as the morning star.

On the other hand, in [Revelation 22:16](https://www.bibleref.com/Revelation/22/Revelation-22-16.html), Jesus refers to Himself as the morning star. This raises the question of why both Jesus and Satan are described as the morning star. To understand this, it is important to note that there are other concepts that are applied to both Jesus and Satan in the Bible. For example, in [Revelation 5:5](https://www.bibleref.com/Revelation/5/Revelation-5-5.html), Jesus is referred to as the Lion of the tribe of Judah, while in [1 Peter 5:8](https://www.bibleref.com/1-Peter/5/1-Peter-5-8.html), Satan is compared to a lion seeking someone to devour.

These similarities between Jesus and Satan serve different purposes. Jesus is compared to a lion because He is the King, royal, and majestic. In contrast, Satan is compared to a lion because he seeks to devour others. While there are similarities between Jesus and Satan in certain aspects, it is crucial to recognize that they are fundamentally different.

The term "morning star" signifies a star that outshines all others. In this context, Jesus is described as the bright morning star. As God incarnate and the Lord of the universe, Jesus represents the most holy and powerful light in all creation. On the other hand, Satan's status as a morning star is limited to being a created being whose light only exists because God created it.

It is important to emphasize that while both Jesus and Satan can be described as morning stars, this does not equate them. Jesus is the one true bright morning star, the light of the world, while Satan is a poor imitation. Jesus' light is self-existent and unmatched.

### Why This Matters

Understanding the concept of the morning star helps us grasp the differences between Jesus and Satan. It highlights Jesus' divine nature as the ultimate source of light and power. Recognizing that Satan is a created being reminds us of his limited authority and the inherent superiority of Jesus.

Moreover, this distinction serves as a reminder to Christians that we should not be deceived by false imitations or teachings that try to equate Jesus with anything or anyone less than His true glory. It reinforces the importance of staying rooted in Biblical truth and recognizing Jesus as the sole Savior and source of eternal life.

### Think About It

1. How does the concept of Jesus as the bright morning star impact your understanding of His power and authority?
2. In what ways can false imitations or teachings try to diminish Jesus' true glory in your life?
3. Reflect on how recognizing Jesus as the ultimate source of light can bring hope and assurance in challenging times.

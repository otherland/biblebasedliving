## God: Perfect and Worthy of Worship

In the Christian faith, God is seen as perfect and worthy of all praise and worship. Some may argue that God is an egomaniac due to His demand for worship and His jealousy. However, it is important to understand that God's perfection and authority justify His desire for worship. Let's explore this further:

### The Nature of Egomaniacs

An egomaniac is someone who is obsessively self-centered, often to the point of disregarding others. This kind of behavior is considered negative and unhealthy in humans because we have our own deficiencies and pathologies. However, this cannot be applied to God because He lacks any imperfections or deficiencies. Therefore, labeling God as an egomaniac would be inaccurate.

### Jesus' Statements on Love and Devotion

Some people point to passages like [Matthew 10:37](https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/10/Matthew-10-37.html)–39 where Jesus says, "Anyone who loves their father or mother more than me is not worthy of me; anyone who loves their son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me." These statements might seem egoistic if they were made by an ordinary person with a sinful nature. However, coming from the perfect Son of Man, God Incarnate, they are perfectly appropriate.

### God's Ownership and Right to Worship

As the Creator of the universe ([Genesis 1:1](https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/1/Genesis-1-1.html)), God owns everything. He is all-powerful, perfect, and worthy of all praise. Therefore, it is justified for Him to demand our focus on worshiping Him, serving Him, and giving up everything to follow Him. The Great Commandment emphasizes this when it states, "‘Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.’ This is the first and greatest commandment" ([Matthew 22:37](https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/22/Matthew-22-37.html)–38).

### God's Love for Humanity

In His "holy self-centeredness," God still shows love and care for others. He loved the world so much that He gave His one and only Son, Jesus, so that whoever believes in Him shall not perish but have eternal life ([John 3:16](https://www.bibleref.com/John/3/John-3-16.html)). This act of sacrificial love demonstrates the greatest love possible. Jesus Himself lived a selfless life devoted to humbly helping others.

### God's Perfection

God is perfect in every way. His works are perfect ([Deuteronomy 32:4](https://www.bibleref.com/Deuteronomy/32/Deuteronomy-32-4.html); [2 Samuel 22:31](https://www.bibleref.com/2-Samuel/22/2-Samuel-22-31.html)), His knowledge is perfect ([Job 36:4](https://www.bibleref.com/Job/36/Job-36-4.html), 37:16), His words are perfect ([Psalm 18:30](https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/18/Psalm-18-30.html)), His laws are perfect ([Psalm 19:7](https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/19/Psalm-19-7.html)), His beauty is perfect ([Psalm 50:2](https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/50/Psalm-50-2.html)), His faithfulness is perfect ([Isaiah 25:1](https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/25/Isaiah-25-1.html)), His will is perfect ([Romans 12:2](https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/12/Romans-12-2.html)), and His love is perfect ([1 John 4:18](https://www.bibleref.com/1-John/4/1-John-4-18.html)). There is no imperfection in Him or in any of His ways.

### The True Egomaniacs

Those who try to usurp God's authority or steal His glory by placing themselves above Him are the true egomaniacs. God alone is worthy of all praise and worship. As humans, we should recognize our rightful place as created beings and humbly submit to God's authority.

## Why This Matters

Understanding the nature of God and our relationship with Him is crucial for our faith and spiritual growth. Recognizing God as the perfect and worthy object of our worship helps us align our lives with His will. This understanding can bring us closer to God, deepen our faith, and guide our actions.

## Think About It

1. Reflect on your own understanding of God's perfection. How does it impact your view of Him and your relationship with Him?
2. Consider the concept of worship. How does recognizing God's authority and worthiness shape your approach to worship?
3. Have you ever struggled with placing something or someone above God in your life? How did it affect your relationship with Him, and how did you rectify it?
4. In what ways can you demonstrate selflessness and love for others, following the example set by Jesus?

Remember, God's desire for worship is not rooted in egomania but in His perfect nature and rightful authority. Embracing this truth can lead us to a deeper understanding of God's love and a more meaningful relationship with Him.

## Ancient of Days

The term "Ancient of Days" is mentioned in the Bible and is associated with God. It first appears in the book of Daniel, specifically in [Daniel 7:9](https://www.bibleref.com/Daniel/7/Daniel-7-9.html). In this passage, Daniel describes a vision of heaven where he sees an ancient Person sitting on a flaming throne with wheels of fire. This person has hair and clothing that are white as snow. The flaming throne symbolizes judgment, while the white hair and the title "Ancient of Days" indicate that God existed before time began.

In [Isaiah 43:13](https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/43/Isaiah-43-13.html), God refers to Himself as existing from the "ancient of days", which means "before days were". This implies that God existed before days were even created. We learn from Genesis 1 that God created time, days, and nights, so He existed before the beginning of time itself. God is often represented as ancient because He is "from everlasting to everlasting" ([Psalm 90:2](https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/90/Psalm-90-2.html)) and is described as "the first and the last" in [Isaiah 44:6](https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/44/Isaiah-44-6.html).

It is important to note that the title "Ancient of Days" is found only three times in Scripture, all three in prophetic passages in [Daniel 7:9](https://www.bibleref.com/Daniel/7/Daniel-7-9.html), 13, and 22. In verse 22, the term specifically refers to Jesus Christ, whose judgment will be part of end-times events. In [Daniel 7:13](https://www.bibleref.com/Daniel/7/Daniel-7-13.html), the term "ancient of days" refers to God the Father, and we see Him on His throne as Jesus, referred to as the "Son of Man," approaches the throne on clouds.

### The Ancient of Days as Judge

The description of the Ancient of Days in Daniel 7 is closely related to judgment. In [Revelation 1:14-15](https://www.bibleref.com/Revelation/1/Revelation-1-14.html), a similar description is used to depict Jesus Christ, who has snow-white hair and blazing eyes. In the book of Revelation, Jesus, as the Son of God, exercises the power of judgment over His church, just as the Ancient of Days judges Israel. His sharp gaze in Revelation 1â€“3 represents His complete understanding and judgment of the reality of all there is to know.

### The Triune God

The concept of the Ancient of Days also highlights the triune nature of God. God is a triune God, meaning three Persons in One. At different times, the term "Ancient of Days" refers to both Jesus Christ and God the Father. In the prophetic sense, it clearly refers to Jesus, the Ancient of Days, who will return to pronounce judgment on the world ([Daniel 7:22](https://www.bibleref.com/Daniel/7/Daniel-7-22.html)).

### Why This Matters

Understanding the concept of the Ancient of Days helps us grasp the eternal nature of God and His authority as Judge. It reminds us that God existed before time began and that He has always been in control. The title "Ancient of Days" also emphasizes the triune nature of God, highlighting the unique roles and relationships within the Godhead. This concept ultimately points us to Jesus Christ, who will return as the Ancient of Days to bring final judgment and establish His kingdom.

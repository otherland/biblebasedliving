## Immanuel Jesus

The name "Immanuel" is significant in the Bible, particularly in relation to the birth of Jesus Christ. In the book of Isaiah, the prophet Isaiah declares a prophecy about a virgin who will conceive and give birth to a son, and he will be called Immanuel. This prophecy is initially fulfilled during Isaiah's time but ultimately points to the birth of Jesus. In the Gospel of Matthew, it is mentioned that the birth of Jesus fulfills this prophecy. However, it's important to note that Immanuel is not Jesus' given name but rather one of the names given to him in the Old and New Testaments.

### The Meaning of Immanuel

Immanuel means "God with us." It signifies that Jesus is God in human form and that he dwelt among humanity during his incarnation. He is not just an ordinary human being but God himself who came to be with us. This concept demonstrates the divine nature of Jesus and emphasizes his presence and accessibility to us.

### Names Given to Jesus

Throughout the Bible, Jesus is referred to by various names that describe his character, role, and attributes. While these names are not necessarily his given name, they serve as accurate descriptions of who he is and what he does. Some of these names include "Wonderful Counselor," "Mighty God," "Everlasting Father," and "Prince of Peace" as prophesied by Isaiah. These names highlight the extraordinary nature of Jesus and his divine qualities.

### The Name Given by Jeremiah

Jeremiah, another prophet in the Bible, also provides insight into the name of the coming Messiah. He prophesies that the Messiah will be called "The LORD is our righteousness." While Jesus was never called this specific name during his time on earth, it reflects his role in bringing righteousness to humanity. Through Jesus, we can receive the righteousness of God, as he is both God in the flesh and the one who makes us righteous.

### Multiple Names, Same Person

Just as George Herman Ruth was known by various names like "Babe," "the Bambino," "the Sultan of Swat," or "the Colossus of Clout," Jesus can be referred to by different names. These names reflect his divine nature, miraculous work, and personal history. While Jesus is his given name, we can also call him Immanuel or any of the other names that capture his character and role.

### The Significance of Immanuel

The inclusion of the name Immanuel in the prophecy and its fulfillment in Jesus underscores several important truths. Firstly, it affirms that Jesus is God incarnate, God in human form, who came to dwell among us. Secondly, it assures us that God keeps his promises, as the virgin birth of Jesus fulfills the prophecy made by Isaiah centuries before. Thirdly, it emphasizes that Jesus is always with us, demonstrating his omnipotence, omniscience, perfection, and unfailing love.

### Why This Matters

Understanding the significance of Immanuel helps us grasp the profound nature of Jesus' identity and mission. It reminds us that Jesus is not just a historical figure or a wise teacher but God himself who chose to enter into human history for our salvation. Recognizing Jesus as Immanuel deepens our appreciation for his divine attributes and his constant presence in our lives.

### Think About It

Consider the implications of Jesus being called Immanuel, "God with us." How does this truth impact your understanding of Jesus' identity and his relationship with you? How does knowing that God keeps his promises through the fulfillment of prophecies like the birth of Jesus increase your confidence in him? Take a moment to reflect on the significance of Immanuel in your own faith journey.

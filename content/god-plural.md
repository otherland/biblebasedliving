## God Plural

In the book of Genesis, there are verses that refer to God using plural constructions. For example, [Genesis 1:26](https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/1/Genesis-1-26.html) states, "Then God said, 'Let us make man in our image, in our likeness, and let them rule over the fish of the sea and the birds of the air, over the livestock, over all the earth, and over all the creatures that move along the ground.'" This raises the question of why God would refer to Himself in the plural.

There are a few possible explanations for this. One is that God was including the angels in His statement. In saying "us" and "our," God may have been speaking of all the heavenly host, including Himself. However, it's important to note that the Bible does not state that angels have the same "image" or "likeness" as God. These descriptions are given to humanity alone.

Another possible explanation is that these verses represent a conversation within the Trinity. The Trinity is a Christian doctrine that teaches that God exists in three Persons: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. So when God refers to Himself in the plural, He could be having a "conversation" within the Trinity. The Old Testament hints at the plurality of God, and the New Testament clarifies this plurality with the doctrine of the Trinity.

It's important to understand that when we talk about God being plural, we do not mean that there are multiple gods. The Bible clearly states that there is only one God. For example, in [Isaiah 45:5](https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/45/Isaiah-45-5.html), 6, and 18, God says, "I am the LORD, and there is no other; there is no God besides Me." Polytheism, which is belief in multiple gods, contradicts countless other Scriptures that affirm the oneness of God.

While we may not fully understand how the Trinity works, God has given us enough information to know that He exists as three Persons in one God. This concept is unique to Christianity and sets it apart from other religions. It is a mystery that we can explore and reflect on, deepening our understanding of God's nature.

### Why This Matters

Understanding the plural references to God in the Bible is important because it helps us grasp the complexity of God's nature. It shows us that God is not limited to our human understanding. The Trinity reveals that God is not just a distant, impersonal force, but a relational Being who desires to have a personal relationship with us.

Recognizing the plurality of God also highlights the importance of unity within the Christian faith. If God exists as a community of Persons, then we, as His followers, are called to live in unity and love with one another. The Trinity serves as a model for how we should relate to one another and work together for the common good.

### Think About It

1. How does the concept of the Trinity impact your understanding of God's love for you?
2. In what ways can the idea of God's plurality encourage unity within the Church?
3. Reflect on your own understanding of God's nature. How does it align with the biblical teaching on the Trinity? Is there anything you need to adjust or learn more about?

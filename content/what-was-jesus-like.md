## What Was Jesus Like?

Jesus, the central figure of Christianity, possessed a unique and remarkable character that drew people to Him. Despite not having physical attractiveness, it was His personality that captivated others. Let's explore the key aspects of Jesus' character and how we can seek to emulate His example.

### Compassionate and Caring

Jesus was known for His deep compassion. He saw the crowds and felt deep empathy for them, describing them as "harassed and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd" ([Matthew 9:36](https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/9/Matthew-9-36.html)). This compassion led Him to heal their diseases ([Matthew 14:14](https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/14/Matthew-14-14.html); 20:34) and miraculously provide food for large crowds ([Matthew 14:13](https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/14/Matthew-14-13.html)–21; 15:29–39). Jesus' compassionate nature reminds us to care for those in need and offer practical help.

**Why This Matters:** Jesus' compassion challenges us to recognize the suffering of those around us and respond with love and kindness. By following Jesus' example, we can make a positive impact on others' lives.

**Think About It:** How can you show compassion to those around you? Are there practical ways you can extend a helping hand to those in need?

### Serious and Focused

Jesus had a clear mission in life and remained focused on it. He understood the importance of His purpose and the limited time He had on Earth. Jesus approached His mission with a servant's heart, declaring that He "did not come to be served, but to serve" ([Mark 10:45](https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/10/Mark-10-45.html)). His humility, kindness, and selflessness characterized His entire personality.

**Why This Matters:** Jesus' focus on serving others challenges us to prioritize selflessness in our own lives. By seeking opportunities to serve and help others, we can fulfill our purpose just as Jesus did.

**Think About It:** How can you align your life with Jesus' mission of serving others? In what ways can you prioritize selflessness in your daily interactions?

### Submission to God's Will

Jesus demonstrated a profound submission to His Father's will. He understood that the only acceptable payment for our salvation was His sacrifice on the cross. In the face of immense suffering, Jesus prayed, "My Father, if it is possible, may this cup be taken from me. Yet not as I will, but as you will" ([Matthew 26:39](https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/26/Matthew-26-39.html)). Even as a child, Jesus was obedient to His earthly parents, Mary and Joseph ([Luke 2:51](https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/2/Luke-2-51.html)). His obedience extended to His heavenly Father as well, learning obedience through suffering ([Hebrews 5:8](https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/5/Hebrews-5-8.html)) and resisting temptations without sinning ([Hebrews 4:15](https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/4/Hebrews-4-15.html)).

**Why This Matters:** Jesus' submission to God's will challenges us to surrender our own desires and align them with God's purpose for our lives. By submitting to God, we can experience growth and transformation.

**Think About It:** How can you cultivate a heart of submission to God's will in your daily life? Are there areas where you struggle to surrender your desires to Him?

### Merciful and Forgiving

Jesus possessed a heart full of mercy and forgiveness. Even while suffering on the cross, He prayed for forgiveness for those who crucified Him, saying, "Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing" ([Luke 23:34](https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/23/Luke-23-34.html)). Jesus' love extended to His close relationships as well. [John 11:5](https://www.bibleref.com/John/11/John-11-5.html) tells us that He loved Martha, her sister Mary, and their brother Lazarus. The Gospel of John also refers to John himself as "the disciple whom Jesus loved" ([John 13:23](https://www.bibleref.com/John/13/John-13-23.html)).

**Why This Matters:** Jesus' mercy and forgiveness challenge us to extend grace to others and cultivate a forgiving heart. By imitating Jesus' love and forgiveness, we can bring healing and restoration to broken relationships.

**Think About It:** Are there individuals in your life who need your forgiveness? How can you extend mercy and forgiveness to those who have wronged you?

### Truthful and Peaceable

Jesus consistently spoke the truth and lived a life of integrity. He never violated His own word and was known for His honesty. Jesus declared, "I am the way and the truth and the life" ([John 14:6](https://www.bibleref.com/John/14/John-14-6.html)). At the same time, He exhibited peaceable qualities, avoiding arguments and coercion as He shared His message.

**Why This Matters:** Jesus' commitment to truth challenges us to value honesty and integrity in our own lives. By living truthfully and peacefully, we reflect Jesus' character to those around us.

**Think About It:** How can you prioritize truthfulness and honesty in your interactions with others? In what ways can you promote peace instead of engaging in arguments or disputes?

### Intimate Relationships

Jesus valued intimate relationships. He invested quality time with His followers, teaching them and guiding them towards eternal truths. Jesus also maintained an intimate relationship with His heavenly Father through regular prayer, obedience, and a deep concern for God's reputation. When Jesus witnessed people exploiting worshipers in the temple, He drove them out, upholding the sanctity of God's house.

### Strong yet Meek Leader

Jesus displayed both strength and meekness in His leadership style. People were drawn to Him wherever He went because of His authority and the way He communicated ([Mark 1:27](https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/1/Mark-1-27.html)–28; [Matthew 7:28](https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/7/Matthew-7-28.html)–29).

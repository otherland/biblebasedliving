## Anthropopathism

In the Bible, there are instances where human characteristics are ascribed to God using metaphorical language. These figures of speech are known as anthropomorphisms, meaning "human form." One type of anthropomorphism is anthropopathism, which attributes human emotions to God. While these descriptions are not literal, they help readers relate to God on a more personal level.

**Why This Matters:** Understanding anthropopathism helps us grasp the poetic and figurative nature of certain passages in the Bible. It enables us to appreciate the depth of God's character and relate to Him in a way that resonates with our own emotions.

### Anthropomorphic Language

To comprehend anthropopathic descriptions in the Bible, it's important to recognize their symbolic meaning. God is fundamentally a spiritual being ([John 4:24](https://www.bibleref.com/John/4/John-4-24.html); [1 Timothy 1:17](https://www.bibleref.com/1-Timothy/1/1-Timothy-1-17.html)), so passages that depict Him with physical attributes, such as arms or sitting down, are anthropomorphic. These descriptions should not be taken literally but rather understood as metaphorical expressions.

### Anthropopathic Emotions

The Bible attributes a range of emotions to God. Some of these emotions elicit positive responses from readers, such as rejoicing, compassion, and yearning. These descriptions align with God's love and goodness. However, certain passages may present challenges when emotions like regret or repentance are ascribed to God. It is important to interpret these descriptions carefully and in light of God's holy and righteous nature.

**Think About It:** How does it affect your understanding of God's character when you consider that these emotional descriptions are figurative rather than literal? How might this deepen your relationship with Him?

### Regret and Repentance

In the account of Noah and the flood, Moses describes how God was displeased with the wickedness on earth ([Genesis 6:5](https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/6/Genesis-6-5.html)). The text goes on to say that God "regretted" or "was sorry" that He had made humankind. However, it is crucial to note that these terms should not be taken to mean that God was remorseful over His own sin. Rather, they express His sorrow and disappointment in response to human sin.

A similar use of anthropopathic language is found in [1 Samuel 15:11](https://www.bibleref.com/1-Samuel/15/1-Samuel-15-11.html), where God expresses regret over making Saul king. Again, this should not be understood as God admitting wrongdoing or confessing guilt. Instead, it conveys His sorrow in response to Saul's disobedience.

### Nuanced Meanings

When examining these passages, it is important to consider how certain words used in Bible translations can have nuanced meanings. For example, the word "sorry" can imply an admission of wrongdoing, but it can also express sorrow without indicating moral irresponsibility. Similarly, the word "repent" can convey grief over the sins of others rather than personal guilt.

The King James Version (KJV) uses the word "repented" in [Judges 21:6](https://www.bibleref.com/Judges/21/Judges-21-6.html) to describe the sorrow of the children of Israel over the sin of the tribe of Benjamin. In this context, their repentance does not imply any wrongdoing on their part.

**Think About It:** How does understanding the nuanced meanings of words like "sorry" and "repent" affect your interpretation of passages where these terms are used to describe God's emotions? How does it align with your understanding of His character?

### Communicating Truth through Metaphor

While anthropopathism helps us understand certain aspects of God's nature and character, it is important to remember that the ultimate expression of God's communication to humanity is found in Jesus Christ. As both fully God and fully man, Jesus experienced a range of human emotions, providing a tangible representation of God's sympathy and care for people.

**Why This Matters:** Recognizing that Jesus embodied human emotions allows us to connect with Him on a deeply personal level. It reminds us that God understands our struggles and emotions because He experienced them firsthand.

### Conclusion

Anthropopathism in the Bible uses figurative language to portray God's emotions in ways that resonate with human experiences. These descriptions should not be taken literally, but they convey important truths about God's nature and character. Understanding anthropopathism helps us appreciate the depth of God's love, compassion, and other emotions, while also recognizing the limitations of human language in describing the divine.

**Why This Matters:** By understanding anthropopathism, we can engage with the Bible more deeply, recognizing the richness of its figurative language. This understanding allows us to approach God with a greater sense of awe and appreciation for His unfathomable nature.

**Think About It:** How does knowing that God uses anthropopathic language to communicate truth about Himself impact your reading and interpretation of the Bible? How might it change your perspective on His character and how you relate to Him?

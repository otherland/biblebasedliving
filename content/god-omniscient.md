## God's Omniscience

Omniscience is the state of having total knowledge, the quality of knowing everything. In the Christian faith, it is believed that God is omniscient. This means that He has complete knowledge and understanding of all things. His omniscience is not limited to any one person in the Godheadâ€”Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are all by nature omniscient.

### What Does God Know?

God's omniscience extends to every aspect of His creation. He knows not only the smallest details of our lives but also everything that happens around us. He even knows when a sparrow falls or when we lose a single hair. Nothing escapes His knowledge.

Furthermore, God's knowledge encompasses not only the present but also the past and future. He knows what will occur until the end of history itself. His knowledge is not limited by time or space.

### The New Testament Perspective

In the New Testament, Jesus' omniscience is evident. In [Acts 1:24](https://www.bibleref.com/Acts/1/Acts-1-24.html), the apostles pray, "Lord, you know everyone's heart," implying Jesus' omniscience. This is necessary for Him to be able to receive petitions and intercede at God's right hand.

During His earthly ministry, Jesus demonstrated His omniscience by knowing people's thoughts and details about their lives before even meeting them. For example, He knew about the woman at the well's marital history and also informed His disciples about the death of Lazarus while being physically distant from him.

### The Paradox of Jesus' Omniscience

While Jesus demonstrated omniscience on earth, there are instances where He asked questions that imply a lack of knowledge. However, these questions were often for the benefit of His audience rather than Himself.

It's important to note that Jesus took on human nature and experienced limitations as a man. He "grew in wisdom and stature" and learned obedience through suffering. This controlled lack of knowledge, such as not knowing when the world would end, can be seen as an act of humility in order to fully share in our human nature.

### The Significance of God's Omniscience

God's omniscience has significant implications for our faith and relationship with Him. We can find security in knowing that there is nothing too hard for an omniscient God. He has known us from eternity, even before creation. He foresaw our sin and yet, in His love, drew us to Himself through Jesus Christ.

Our knowledge of God will never be complete, but we can rest in the assurance that He promises never to fail us as long as we continue in Him. Our wonder, love, and praise for Him will continue to grow as we bask in the rays of His heavenly love.

## Why This Matters

Understanding God's omniscience helps us develop a deep trust in Him. Knowing that God has complete knowledge and understanding of everything brings comfort and reassurance. It also reminds us of His sovereignty and power over all things.

Recognizing God's omniscience challenges us to surrender to His wisdom and guidance. When we acknowledge that God knows better than we do, we can trust His plans for our lives even when they don't align with our own desires or understanding.

Knowing that God is all-knowing also encourages us to approach Him with honesty and openness. We can confidently bring our thoughts, concerns, and desires before Him, knowing that He already knows them and desires an intimate relationship with us.

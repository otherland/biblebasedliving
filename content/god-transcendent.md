## God Transcendent

God's transcendent nature is a fundamental aspect of His being. To transcend means to exist above and independent from something, to rise above and surpass it. In this sense, God is the only truly transcendent being. He is the "LORD God Almighty" who created all things on earth, beneath the earth, and in the heavens above. Despite being the creator and sustainer of all things, God exists above and independent from them. He upholds all things by His mighty power, yet He is upheld by Himself alone. The entire universe exists in Him and for Him, bringing Him glory, honor, and praise.

### The Unknown and Unknowable God

As a transcendent being, God is both unknown and unknowable. However, He continually seeks to reveal Himself to His creation. It is a paradox that the unknown seeks to be known. Being transcendent, God is the incomprehensible Creator who exists outside of space and time. Therefore, He is unknowable and unsearchable. Our finite minds and thoughts are far beneath His, making it impossible for us to understand or experience Him through our own will or reasoning. Yet, God desires us to seek Him and know Him.

The Scriptures acknowledge the unfathomable wisdom and knowledge of God, with His judgments and paths beyond our tracing out. No one can fully know the mind of the Lord or be His counselor. No one has ever given anything to God that He should repay them because everything comes from Him, through Him, and belongs to Him. The depth of God's wisdom is beyond measure.

### God's Holiness and Righteousness

Another aspect of God's transcendent nature is His holiness and righteousness. Due to humanity's inclination towards sin and wickedness, we are unable to enter into God's presence. When Moses asked to see God's glory, He was told that no one could see God's face and live. The fullness of God's glory would be too much for any human to bear. Therefore, the complete revelation of God is reserved for the future, when all things will be seen as they are, and we will be in a condition to receive them.

The prophet Isaiah recognized the need for God to remain separate from His creation. He acknowledged that all humans have become unclean, and even their righteous acts are like filthy rags. Our sins cause us to waste away, leading God to hide His face from us. His righteousness and holiness require Him to keep Himself separate from anything sinful, impure, unclean, or less than perfect.

### God's Immanence

Despite His transcendent nature, God also possesses immanence, which refers to His nearness. It is through His immanence that He chooses to draw near to His creation. This creates another paradox—God's transcendent nature strives to keep Him distant and remote from His creation, while His immanent nature works to draw Him near and sustain the universe. God's love for His creation is so great that it overshadows His transcendence.

In Jesus Christ, God broke through the barrier of sin and separation to draw all mankind into a close, personal relationship with Him. Through the indwelling power of the Holy Spirit, God chooses to dwell in the hearts and minds of His people. This miraculous act demonstrates God's immanence, as He personally draws near to His creation.

### Why This Matters

Understanding God's transcendent nature is crucial because it helps us recognize our limitations as finite beings trying to comprehend an infinite God. It humbles us, reminding us that we cannot fully understand or experience God through our own efforts. It also emphasizes the necessity of seeking a personal relationship with Him and relying on His revelation rather than our own reasoning.

Recognizing God's holiness and righteousness highlights the gravity of sin and the need for redemption. It reminds us that our sinful nature separates us from God, but through Jesus Christ, we can be reconciled to Him.

The understanding of God's immanence is essential for believers, as it assures us that God is not distant or remote but desires to have a personal relationship with each one of us. It encourages us to seek His presence and experience His love and guidance in our lives.

### Think About It

- How does recognizing God's transcendent nature impact your understanding of His sovereignty and authority?
- In what ways does understanding God's holiness and righteousness shape your view of sin and redemption?
- Reflect on how God's immanence affects your personal relationship with Him. How does it encourage you to seek His presence and rely on His guidance in your life?

Title: Did Jesus Drink Wine? Exploring Biblical Perspectives on Alcohol Consumption
---

## Did Jesus Drink Wine?

In this article, we will explore the question of whether Jesus drank wine. We will examine various biblical passages and historical context to provide a comprehensive understanding of this topic. It is important to note that this article maintains a Biblical, young-earth, conservative Christian perspective.

### Jesus' First Miracle: Turning Water into Wine

One significant event that sheds light on Jesus' stance towards wine is His first miracle, which took place at the wedding in Cana ([John 2:1-11](https://www.bibleref.com/John/2/John-2-1.html)). During the celebration, when the wine ran out, Jesus miraculously turned water into wine. According to Jewish wedding traditions of that time, fermented wine was always served at weddings. In fact, the master of the feast commented that Jesus' wine was better than what was previously served ([John 2:10-11](https://www.bibleref.com/John/2/John-2-10.html)).

It is worth noting that the Greek word used to describe the state of those who drank Jesus' wine suggests intoxication. This same word is used in [Acts 2:15](https://www.bibleref.com/Acts/2/Acts-2-15.html), where Peter defends the apostles against accusations of drunkenness. Therefore, it appears that the wine Jesus produced had the capacity to intoxicate.

### Jesus and Wine in Cultural Context

While turning water into wine does not directly prove that Jesus drank it Himself, it would have been normal for Him to do so. In fact, [Luke 7:33-34](https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/7/Luke-7-33.html) highlights an incident where Jesus contrasts His own practices with John the Baptist's abstinence from wine. The religious leaders falsely accused Jesus of being a drunkard. However, it is important to remember that Jesus lived a completely sinless life ([1 Peter 2:22](https://www.bibleref.com/1-Peter/2/1-Peter-2-22.html)) and was never a drunkard or glutton.

We must also consider the Passover celebration, which commonly included fermented wine. The Scriptures use the term "fruit of the vine" when referring to the wine consumed during this feast ([Matthew 26:27-29](https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/26/Matthew-26-27.html); [Mark 14:23-25](https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/14/Mark-14-23.html); [Luke 22:17-18](https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/22/Luke-22-17.html)). Jesus actively participated in drinking from the Passover cup ([Mark 14:23](https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/14/Mark-14-23.html)).

### Wine in Biblical Context

It is essential to view wine in its biblical context. While all Christians agree that drunkenness is sinful, wine itself is not inherently sinful. In fact, the Bible presents wine as something to delight in ([Psalm 104:14-15](https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/104/Psalm-104-14.html)). However, there are numerous warnings against alcohol abuse because sinful individuals are more likely to misuse wine than to use it in moderation ([Proverbs 20:1](https://www.bibleref.com/Proverbs/20/Proverbs-20-1.html)).

It is crucial to understand that Jesus' probable use of wine should not be an excuse for drunkenness or excessive consumption. Jesus Himself warns against drunkenness ([Luke 12:45](https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/12/Luke-12-45.html)). Therefore, Christians who choose to drink wine should either do so in moderation, never to the point of drunkenness, or abstain entirely.

### Why This Matters

Understanding whether Jesus drank wine has implications for how Christians approach alcohol today. By examining the biblical evidence, we can gain insight into the proper use and moderation of wine. It allows us to discern between the misuse of alcohol and its responsible consumption.

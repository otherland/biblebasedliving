## Why Worship God

Worshipping God is the supreme purpose for which humans were created. It is at the very core of our existence and the central function of the Church. The Bible teaches that God desires our worship and is the only one worthy of it. But why should we worship God? Let's explore several key reasons.

### 1. Our Purpose as Creations of God

God created us with a deep longing to comprehend our eternal purpose and know our infinite Creator. [Ecclesiastes 3:11](https://www.bibleref.com/Ecclesiastes/3/Ecclesiastes-3-11.html) tells us that God planted eternity in our hearts. This explains why we are not satisfied with earthly endeavors and achievements. We yearn for something greater, something beyond ourselves. We have a built-in craving to worship, and God placed eternity in our hearts so that we would hunger and thirst for Him.

**Why This Matters:** Recognizing our purpose as creations of God helps us understand that only He can truly satisfy the longing within us. It redirects our focus from temporary pursuits to an eternal relationship with our Creator.

**Think About It:** What are some of the temporary things you have pursued or worshipped in your life? How has that left you unsatisfied? How might redirecting your worship towards God change your perspective?

### 2. The Worthiness of God

Worshipping God reveals that He has captured our attention and won our allegiance. He alone is worthy of our worship, as He is the One who created us and redeemed us through Jesus Christ. Our worship acknowledges His worthiness and exalts Him above all else.

**Why This Matters:** Recognizing the worthiness of God helps us prioritize Him above all other things in our lives. It reminds us that nothing else should take His place on the throne of our hearts.

**Think About It:** What are some things or people in your life that have taken priority over God? How might recognizing God's worthiness change your perspective and priorities?

### 3. Worship as a Lifestyle

Worship is not just an event or an activity; it is a way of life for believers. The apostle Paul describes worship as offering our bodies as living sacrifices, holy and pleasing to God. It encompasses every aspect of our lives and is dedicated to glorifying God.

**Why This Matters:** Understanding worship as a lifestyle helps us realize that every moment and every action can be an opportunity to worship God. It transforms our mundane tasks into acts of worship and service to Him.

**Think About It:** How might viewing worship as a lifestyle change the way you approach your daily activities? How can you integrate worship into various aspects of your life?

### 4. Communion with God

Through worship, we experience fellowship and communion with God. It is how we meet with Him and praise Him for His goodness, love, mercy, grace, wisdom, beauty, truth, holiness, compassion, might, and every other aspect of His character. As we worship, we grow closer to Him, and His will becomes our will.

**Why This Matters:** Engaging in worship allows us to connect with God on a deeper level. It opens our hearts to hear from Him and allows His presence to transform us.

**Think About It:** How has worship deepened your relationship with God? In what ways do you experience communion with Him during times of worship?

### 5. Testimony to Others

Our worship not only changes us but also makes God known to others and has the power to impact their lives. When we testify to what God has done in us through worship, others may be amazed and put their trust in the Lord.

**Why This Matters:** Our worship becomes a powerful witness to those around us. It can draw others closer to God and inspire them to seek a relationship with Him.

**Think About It:** How has your worship impacted others? Are there ways you can intentionally share your worship experiences with others to testify to God's goodness and draw them closer to Him?

### 6. Ultimate Purpose and Eternal Life

Worshipping God allows us to fulfill our ultimate purpose and prepares us for eternal life in His presence. In the book of Revelation, we catch a glimpse of the future, where a great multitude from every nation stands before the throne of God, worshipping Him. This vision reminds us that our worship of God is not just for this earthly life but is an everlasting expression of our love and adoration for Him.

**Why This Matters:** Understanding that worship is connected to our ultimate purpose and eternal life helps us focus on what truly matters in the grand scheme of things. It motivates us to live with an eternal perspective.

**Think About It:** How does the promise of eternal life in God's presence impact the way you approach worship? How might focusing on eternity change your priorities and perspective?

In conclusion, there are numerous reasons why we should worship God. From acknowledging our purpose as creations of God, recognizing His worthiness, and embracing worship as a lifestyle, to experiencing communion with Him and testifying to others, worship plays a crucial role in our relationship with God. Ultimately, our worship leads us to fulfill our ultimate purpose and prepares us for an eternity in His presence. As we engage in worship, let us do so with hearts full of gratitude, awe, and adoration for the One who is truly worthy of all our praise.

## Is the Bible Sexist?

The Bible is often criticized for containing passages that appear discriminatory towards women, but it is important to understand the context and purpose of these passages. While the Bible may describe actions that we now consider sexist, it does not mean that God endorses or approves of those actions.

During Old Testament times, nearly every society in the world followed a patriarchal structure where men held authority over women. This historical reality is clearly reflected in Scripture and the rules governing those societies. However, it is crucial to recognize that the establishment of authority in society was ordained by God, not man. Sadly, fallen humanity has corrupted this order, resulting in the inequality and discrimination experienced by women throughout history.

It is essential to understand that sexism is a result of sin. The exclusion and discrimination we find in our world are not new but are consequences of the fall of man and the introduction of sin. Therefore, we can say that the term and practice of "sexism" stem from sin.

However, the progressive revelation of the Bible ultimately leads us to the cure for sexism and all other sinful practices. The New Testament fulfills the Old Testament, providing principles that guide us towards the correct understanding of authority and addressing sin. The cross of Christ serves as the great equalizer, offering salvation to all who believe, regardless of their position in society, mental capacity, or gender.

In [Galatians 3:26-28](https://www.bibleref.com/Galatians/3/Galatians-3-26.html), we find a passage that emphasizes our equal opportunity for salvation: "You are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus, for all of you who were baptized into Christ have clothed yourselves with Christ. There is neither Jew nor Greek, slave nor free, male nor female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus." Therefore, there is no room for sexism at the cross.

The accurate portrayal of sin in both men and women in the Bible does not make it inherently sexist. The Bible records all kinds of sin, including slavery, bondage, and the failures of its greatest heroes. However, it also provides the answer and cure for these sins—a right relationship with God. Through belief in Jesus Christ, we can find the cure for sin, including the sin of sexism.

To achieve a spiritual balance between the God-ordained positions of authority, we must turn to Scripture. When men and women take their God-given places and live according to "thus says the LORD," a wonderful balance between genders can be achieved. This balance reflects God's original intent and will be restored in the end.

## Why This Matters

Understanding the biblical perspective on sexism is essential for Christians as they navigate societal issues and engage in conversations about gender equality. It allows believers to approach these discussions with a solid foundation rooted in Scripture and enables them to address misconceptions about the Bible's stance on sexism.

Recognizing that sexism is a consequence of sin helps Christians understand that true equality can only be found in a personal reconciliation with God through Jesus Christ. This understanding allows believers to pursue justice and equality while acknowledging the ultimate solution lies in transformed hearts through faith in Christ.

## Think About It

1. How does recognizing the historical context of the Bible help us understand its portrayal of gender roles?
2. How does the message of equality through faith in Christ challenge societal norms and expectations?
3. What steps can individuals take to promote biblical equality while living within the structures of authority established by God?

## INRI

When Jesus was crucified, a notice was prepared and placed on the cross. According to [John 19:19](https://www.bibleref.com/John/19/John-19-19.html), the notice read, "JESUS OF NAZARETH, THE KING OF THE JEWS." This notice was written in three languages: Aramaic, Latin, and Greek, as mentioned in [John 19:20](https://www.bibleref.com/John/19/John-19-20.html). Today, it is common to see the letters INRI placed on the sign above the cross. INRI is an abbreviation of the Latin phrase "Iesus Nazarenus Rex Iudaeorum," which translates to "Jesus of Nazareth, the King of the Jews."

However, it is important to note that the exact letters INRI were unlikely to be on the sign that Pilate placed over Jesus' head. [John 19:20](https://www.bibleref.com/John/19/John-19-20.html) specifies that the sign was written in Aramaic, Greek, and Latin. The display of INRI is a symbolic representation of the inscription that would have been present.

It is interesting to observe the difference in terminology used to describe the writing on the sign. While John's gospel refers to it as a "title," Mark and Matthew refer to it as an "accusation." It was customary during that time to display above the heads of those being crucified the crime for which they were suffering and their name. In Jesus' case, the accusation was his claim to be the King of the Jews.

Ironically, this "crime" for which Jesus was crucified is not a crime at all but an absolute truth. Jesus is not only the King of the Jews but also the King of all. He is the King of kings and Lord of lords ([Revelation 17:14](https://www.bibleref.com/Revelation/17/Revelation-17-14.html); 19:16). His kingship extends over the entire universe and all its inhabitants.

The inscription on the cross represents not only Jesus' claim as King but also serves as a reminder of why He was crucified. Jesus' crucifixion was not due to any wrongdoing on His part, but rather, it was for the sins of all who would put their faith in Him for salvation. As [Colossians 2:14](https://www.bibleref.com/Colossians/2/Colossians-2-14.html) states, Jesus "blotted out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to us, and has taken it out of the way, nailing it to the cross."

Just as the title "King of the Jews" was written in multiple languages, people from all nations and languages recognize Jesus as their Savior. He is the perfect and complete Savior who bore our sins in His own body on the cross. He is the only everlasting Savior for all those whom God has chosen to save.

### Why This Matters

Understanding the significance of the inscription on Jesus' cross can deepen our appreciation for His sacrifice. It reminds us that Jesus willingly gave His life for our sake, taking upon Himself the punishment for our sins. The inscription also highlights Jesus' kingship and lordship over all creation. Recognizing Jesus as King and Savior allows us to surrender our lives to Him and experience His transforming power.

### Think About It

1. Reflect on what it means for Jesus to be both King of the Jews and King of all. How does this impact your understanding of His authority and sovereignty?

2. Consider how Jesus' crucifixion serves as a demonstration of His love and willingness to bear the sins of humanity. How does this inspire you to respond to His sacrifice?

3. Contemplate the significance of Jesus being the only and everlasting Savior. How does this truth shape your perspective on salvation and your relationship with Him?

4. Ponder on the inscription on Jesus' cross being written in multiple languages. How does this symbolize Jesus' universal relevance and His invitation to all people, regardless of their background or language?

## Who Killed Jesus?

The question of who is responsible for the death of Jesus is complex and involves multiple parties. While it is true that the Jews, particularly the scribes, Sadducees, and Pharisees, strongly opposed Jesus and played a role in His arrest and condemnation ([Matthew 21:15](https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/21/Matthew-21-15.html); [Luke 11:53](https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/11/Luke-11-53.html); [John 5:18](https://www.bibleref.com/John/5/John-5-18.html); 7:45–52; 12:37), they are not solely to blame. The chief priests and elders also accused and mocked Jesus, holding council to have Him arrested and sentenced to death ([Matthew 27:12](https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/27/Matthew-27-12.html); [Mark 15:1](https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/15/Mark-15-1.html)). Additionally, Judas, a Jew, betrayed Jesus ([John 18:2](https://www.bibleref.com/John/18/John-18-2.html)), and the Jewish crowd shouted for Jesus to be crucified ([Luke 23:21](https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/23/Luke-23-21.html)) and asked for Barabbas to be released instead of Him ([Matthew 27:21](https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/27/Matthew-27-21.html)). Therefore, part of the responsibility falls on the Jews who plotted against Jesus.

However, it is important to note that the blame cannot be placed solely on the Jews. According to Peter's sermon on the Day of Pentecost, while the Jews played a role in Jesus' death, it was ultimately part of God's deliberate plan. Peter says, "This man was handed over to you by God’s deliberate plan and foreknowledge; and you, with the help of wicked men, put him to death by nailing him to the cross" ([Acts 2:23](https://www.bibleref.com/Acts/2/Acts-2-23.html)). The Romans were the "wicked men" who physically carried out Jesus' crucifixion. They perfected crucifixion as a method of execution and subjected Jesus to torture before crucifying Him. Pontius Pilate, the Roman governor, sentenced Jesus to be flogged and crucified ([Matthew 27:26](https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/27/Matthew-27-26.html); [John 19:1](https://www.bibleref.com/John/19/John-19-1.html)). Roman soldiers mocked Him, drove nails into His hands and feet, and pierced His side with a spear ([Matthew 27:28](https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/27/Matthew-27-28.html)–29; [John 19:23](https://www.bibleref.com/John/19/John-19-23.html), 34). Therefore, the Romans also share the blame for killing Jesus.

While the Jews and Romans played significant roles in Jesus' death, it is essential to understand that God the Father had a purpose in allowing Jesus to die. [Romans 3:25](https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/3/Romans-3-25.html) states that God presented Christ as a sacrifice of atonement through the shedding of His blood, and [Romans 8:32](https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/8/Romans-8-32.html) emphasizes that God did not spare His own Son but gave Him up for us all. [Isaiah 53:10](https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/53/Isaiah-53-10.html) reveals that it was the Lord's will to crush Jesus and make His life an offering for sin. Although God did not physically put Jesus on the cross or pound the nails, the crucifixion was part of God's plan to redeem humanity. Jesus willingly laid down His life to save us from our sins ([John 10:17](https://www.bibleref.com/John/10/John-10-17.html)–19) and took the punishment we deserved, reconciling us to God ([2 Corinthians 5:21](https://www.bibleref.com/2-Corinthians/5/2-Corinthians-5-21.html)). 

The death of Jesus was necessary for our salvation because it satisfied God's holy wrath against sin. In Genesis 22, Abraham was about to sacrifice his son Isaac in obedience to God's command, but the angel of the Lord provided a ram as a substitute sacrifice. Similarly, Jesus became our substitute on the cross. His death allowed God to spare us and bring sinners to heaven without violating His justice ([Romans 3:25](https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/3/Romans-3-25.html)–26). The atonement of Christ was prophesied in [Isaiah 53:5](https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/53/Isaiah-53-5.html), where it is said that He was pierced for our transgressions, crushed for our iniquities, and by His wounds, we are healed.

In light of these truths, it is important to recognize that all of humanity shares in the guilt of killing Jesus. It was our sin that put Him on the cross. Yet, God used this unlawful killing as the means of our salvation. God can use even the wickedest of actions to bring about His perfect plan ([Genesis 50:20](https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/50/Genesis-50-20.html)). While sinful people were responsible for Jesus' death, God's response to evil is redemptive and displays His great love for us. As [Romans 5:6](https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/5/Romans-5-6.html)–8 states, "You see, at just the right time, when we were still powerless, Christ died for the ungodly. Very rarely will anyone die for a righteous person, though for a good person someone might possibly dare to die. But God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us."

### Why This Matters

Understanding who killed Jesus is significant because it reveals the depth of God's love and His redemptive plan for humanity. Recognizing that all of humanity shares in the guilt of Jesus' death should humble us and lead us to acknowledge our need for a Savior. It reminds us of the seriousness of sin and the incredible sacrifice Jesus made on our behalf. This knowledge should motivate us to respond with gratitude and surrender to God's saving grace.

### Think About It

1. Reflect on the fact that Jesus willingly laid down His life for you. How does this impact your understanding of His love for you?
2. Consider the role you play in Jesus' death due to your sin. How does this realization influence your understanding of your need for salvation?
3. Meditate on the truth that God used the unjust killing of Jesus to accomplish His redemptive plan. How does this display God's sovereignty and ability to bring good out of evil?

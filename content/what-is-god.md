## What is God?

**Key Points:**

1. God's nature is beyond human comprehension.
2. God revealed Himself as "I AM WHO I AM."
3. God is a self-existent and necessary being.
4. God is personal and has a purpose.
5. God is a Triune being.
6. God is love.

### God's Incomprehensible Nature

A. W. Tozer rightly pointed out that we cannot fully comprehend what God is like in Himself. The book of Job asks, "Can you discover the depths of God? Can you discover the limits of the Almighty?" ([Job 11:7-8](https://www.bibleref.com/Job/11/Job-11-7.html)). However, while we cannot fully comprehend God's essence, He has revealed aspects of Himself that we can understand.

### "I AM WHO I AM"

When Moses asked God what His name was, God replied, "I AM WHO I AM" ([Exodus 3:14](https://www.bibleref.com/Exodus/3/Exodus-3-14.html)). This name signifies that God is pure existence or pure actuality. He is the only one who can say, "I be that I be." While many things have existence, only God is Being itself.

### Self-Existence and First Cause

God is a self-existent being and the first cause of everything else that exists. He has life in Himself ([John 5:26](https://www.bibleref.com/John/5/John-5-26.html)) and does not depend on anything or anyone else for His existence ([Acts 17:25](https://www.bibleref.com/Acts/17/Acts-17-25.html)).

### Necessary Being

God is a necessary being, meaning His nonexistence is impossible. All other things are contingent beings, meaning they could not exist without Him. If God did not exist, nothing else would exist either ([Job 34:14-15](https://www.bibleref.com/Job/34/Job-34-14.html)).

### Personal and Purposeful

God is a personal being with intent and will. He has a purpose, creates, and directs events according to His plan ([Isaiah 46:9-10](https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/46/Isaiah-46-9.html)). While the word "personal" doesn't refer to personality traits, it emphasizes that God has intentions and acts purposefully.

### The Triune Nature of God

The Bible affirms that there is only one God ([Deuteronomy 6:4](https://www.bibleref.com/Deuteronomy/6/Deuteronomy-6-4.html)), but it also reveals a plurality within the Godhead. Jesus commanded His disciples to baptize in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit ([Matthew 28:19](https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/28/Matthew-28-19.html)). This indicates a unity and diversity within the Godhead.

Throughout Scripture, the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are referred to as God. Jesus is described as the first cause of everything and possessing self-existence ([John 1:3-4](https://www.bibleref.com/John/1/John-1-3.html), [Colossians 1:17](https://www.bibleref.com/Colossians/1/Colossians-1-17.html)).

### God is Love

First [John 4:8](https://www.bibleref.com/John/4/John-4-8.html) simply states, "God is love." While many things can possess and experience love, only God is love itself. This aspect of God's nature is fundamental to understanding His character and His relationship with humanity.

## Why This Matters

Understanding what God is like helps us develop a more accurate view of Him and deepens our relationship with Him. Recognizing His self-existence and necessary being helps us grasp His sovereignty and understand that He is the ultimate source of all life. Knowing that God is personal and purposeful assures us that He has intentions for our lives and directs events according to His plan. Recognizing the triune nature of God helps us comprehend how He can be both one and yet exist in a relational community. Understanding that God is love allows us to experience His love more fully and reflect that love in our relationships with others.

## Think About It

1. How does understanding God's nature as self-existent and necessary impact your view of His sovereignty?
2. In what ways does recognizing God as personal and purposeful affect your understanding of His involvement in your life?
3. How does contemplating the triune nature of God deepen your appreciation for the complexity and unity within the Godhead?
4. Reflect on the statement "God is love." How does this reality impact your understanding of His character and His love for you?

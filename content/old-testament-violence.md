## Old Testament Violence

The issue of violence in the Old Testament has long been a topic of controversy and criticism. Critics argue that the God of the Old Testament is portrayed as a vindictive and bloodthirsty deity, commanding genocide and indiscriminate massacre. However, it is essential to examine whether these criticisms are valid, or if there may be morally sufficient reasons behind God's commands.

### The Canaanite Culture

A basic understanding of Canaanite culture reveals its inherent moral wickedness. The Canaanites were a brutal and aggressive people who engaged in practices such as bestiality, incest, and even child sacrifice. Their deviant sexual acts were considered normal. God's judgment was primarily directed at the Canaanite religion rather than the people themselves. It is important to note that individual Canaanites who repented could find mercy (Joshua 2). God's desire is for the wicked to turn from their sins rather than face destruction ([Ezekiel 18:31](https://www.bibleref.com/Ezekiel/18/Ezekiel-18-31.html)–32; 33:11).

### The Role of Israel in God's Plan

God used the conquest of Canaan to create a religious and historical context in which He could introduce the Messiah to the world. This Messiah would bring salvation not only to Israel but also to Israel's enemies, including Canaan ([Psalm 87:4](https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/87/Psalm-87-4.html)–6; [Mark 7:25](https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/7/Mark-7-25.html)–30). The purpose of this conquest was not only to punish the sinful nations but also to bring about redemption and salvation.

### Time for Repentance

It is worth noting that God gave the Canaanite people over 400 years to repent of their evil ways. The book of Hebrews refers to them as "disobedient," suggesting moral culpability on their part ([Hebrews 11:31](https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/11/Hebrews-11-31.html)). The Canaanites were aware of God's power and had the opportunity to seek repentance. Unfortunately, they continued their rebellion against God until the end.

### Killing Non-Combatants

Critics often point out that God commanded the Israelites to kill non-combatants. While it is true that the Canaanite women did not fight, their seductive behavior in Numbers 25 indicates their participation in the sinful practices of their culture ([Numbers 25:1](https://www.bibleref.com/Numbers/25/Numbers-25-1.html)–3). Additionally, it is important to recognize that no human person, including infants, is truly innocent. Scripture teaches that all people are born in sin ([Psalm 51:5](https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/51/Psalm-51-5.html); 58:3). Infants are as morally culpable for Adam's sin as adults are.

### God's Sovereignty Over Life

God is sovereign over all life and has the right to give or take it as He sees fit. He ultimately takes every person's life at death. While it is wrong for humans to take a life, except in cases of capital punishment, war, and self-defense, it does not mean that it is wrong for God to do so. God alone has the authority to determine when and how life ends. Ultimately, our lives belong to Him.

### Consideration for Children

One might argue that it would have been cruel for God to spare only the infants and children of Canaan, as they would have faced death due to starvation without the protection and support of their parents. Moreover, these children would likely have grown up sympathetic to the evil religions practiced by their parents. By ending the culture of idolatry and perversion in Canaan, God sought to protect future generations from continuing in those sinful practices.

### The Eternal State of Infants

The fate of the infants killed in Canaan raises questions about their eternal state. If God took them before reaching moral accountability, they would have gone straight to heaven. In this view, those children are in a far better place than if they had lived into adulthood as Canaanites. It is essential to trust in God's justice and mercy, even in difficult and complex situations.

### Why This Matters

Understanding the violence in the Old Testament is crucial for believers as it helps us grapple with challenging theological questions. It allows us to explore God's character and His ways, recognizing that His perspective is eternal and beyond our understanding. By examining the context and reasons behind God's commands, we can deepen our faith and trust in His sovereignty.

### Think About It

1. How does knowing the moral wickedness of the Canaanite culture affect your understanding of God's judgment?
2. What are some possible reasons why God commanded the destruction of Canaan?
3. How does the concept of God's sovereignty over life challenge or strengthen your faith?
4. Reflect on the eternal state of infants killed in Canaan. How does this perspective influence your understanding of God's justice and mercy?

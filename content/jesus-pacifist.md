## Jesus as a Non-Violent Figure

Jesus is often described as a pacifist, someone who opposes violence and war for any purpose. His message during His time on Earth emphasized non-violence and love for one's enemies. However, it is important to note that the Bible also acknowledges that there are times when war may be necessary. So, while Jesus can be seen as a figure of peace, it is not accurate to label Him solely as a pacifist.

### Jesus' Non-Violent Message

In the Bible, Jesus teaches His followers to turn the other cheek and to love their enemies ([Matthew 5:38](https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/5/Matthew-5-38.html)–44). These teachings emphasize forgiveness and non-retaliation. Jesus encourages His disciples to pursue peaceful resolutions and to respond to hostility with kindness and compassion. His non-violent approach is evident in His interactions with people, including the Roman centurion whom He commended for his faith ([Matthew 8:5](https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/8/Matthew-8-5.html)–13). Jesus did not tell the centurion to leave the army, indicating that He was not advocating for pacifism.

### Instances of Violence in Prophecy

While Jesus' earthly ministry focused on non-violence, the Bible also contains prophecies that depict Him engaging in violence. In [Revelation 19:15](https://www.bibleref.com/Revelation/19/Revelation-19-15.html), it is written that Jesus will come with a sharp sword to strike down nations and rule them with an iron scepter. This imagery suggests a future war against the forces of evil. Additionally, [Revelation 19:13](https://www.bibleref.com/Revelation/19/Revelation-19-13.html) mentions that Jesus' robe will be "dipped in blood," further alluding to a violent conflict. These prophecies indicate that there will be a time when violence becomes necessary in establishing Jesus' millennial kingdom.

### The Disciples and Weapons

Contrary to the idea that Jesus was a pacifist, His disciples were recorded as owning weapons. On the night of His betrayal, Jesus instructed His followers to bring swords, and they had two ([Luke 22:37](https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/22/Luke-22-37.html)–39). Jesus did not condemn their ownership of weapons but rather cautioned against their misuse. When Peter attempted to use his sword during Jesus' arrest, Jesus healed the injured man and told Peter to put away his weapon ([John 18:10-11](https://www.bibleref.com/John/18/John-18-10.html)). This interaction suggests that Jesus acknowledged the presence of weapons among His disciples but did not endorse violence as a means to achieve His mission.

### The Balance of Life's Activities

The book of Ecclesiastes presents a balanced view of life's activities, including times for killing, tearing down, war, and peace ([Ecclesiastes 3:1](https://www.bibleref.com/Ecclesiastes/3/Ecclesiastes-3-1.html), 3, 8). These verses demonstrate that there are moments when conflict and even war are appropriate responses to certain situations. They emphasize that being a follower of Jesus does not require pacifism but rather calls for standing against evil and pursuing righteousness.

### Conflict in Pursuit of Truth

Jesus Himself stated that He came not to bring peace but a sword ([Matthew 10:34](https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/10/Matthew-10-34.html)–36). This statement does not advocate for warfare but rather highlights the potential conflict that arises when truth confronts opposing ideologies. Jesus openly challenged the religious and political leaders of His time because they were not seeking God's righteousness ([Luke 13:31](https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/13/Luke-13-31.html)–32; 19:45–47). His willingness to engage in conflict when necessary shows that He prioritized truth over maintaining peace at any cost.

### God's Role in Warfare

Throughout the Old Testament, there are numerous instances where God used His people in warfare to bring judgment upon nations whose sin had reached its full measure. For example, before the battle of Jericho, Joshua encountered "the commander of the army of the Lord," who held a drawn sword ([Joshua 5:13-14](https://www.bibleref.com/Joshua/5/Joshua-5-13.html)). This figure is believed to be the pre-incarnate Christ. These accounts demonstrate that God is not a pacifist and intervenes in human affairs when necessary to execute justice.

## Why This Matters

Understanding Jesus' stance on violence is crucial for Christians as they navigate moral and ethical dilemmas related to war and conflict. While Jesus taught non-violence and love for enemies, the Bible also acknowledges that there are times when war may be justified. This recognition helps Christians discern when it is appropriate to engage in warfare in defense of justice and the protection of innocent lives.

## Think About It

1. How does Jesus' emphasis on non-violence impact your understanding of conflict resolution and forgiveness in your own life?
2. In what situations do you think it is justifiable for Christians to participate in warfare? How can you reconcile this with Jesus' teachings?
3. Reflect on the balance between pursuing peace and standing against evil in the world. How can you actively promote peace while also opposing injustice and oppression?

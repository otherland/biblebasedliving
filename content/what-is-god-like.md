Title: 'Discovering the Divine: What God is Really Like'
---

## What is God Like?

Every culture throughout history has had its own understanding of what God is like. Some have believed that God controls the weather and depicted Him as a storm god throwing lightning bolts (Baal worship in Canaan). Others worshiped the sun, considering it the most powerful entity (Ra worship in Egypt). Pantheistic beliefs saw God as being present in everything, while some turned to agnosticism or worshiped an "Unknown God" to cover all bases ([Acts 17:23](https://www.bibleref.com/Acts/17/Acts-17-23.html)).

However, these assumptions only provide a partial picture of who God truly is. While it is true that God controls the weather, He also has control over much more. He is more powerful than the sun, and He transcends everything. Thankfully, even though there are aspects of God that we may not fully understand, He has revealed Himself to us through the Bible. In fact, God desires to be known ([Psalm 46:10](https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/46/Psalm-46-10.html)).

Norman Geisler and Frank Turek, in their book "I Don't Have Enough Faith to Be an Atheist," provide some important insights into the nature of truth. They state that truth is discovered, not invented, and it exists independently of anyone's knowledge of it. Truth is also transcultural, meaning that if something is true, it applies to all people, everywhere, at all times. Furthermore, truth is unchanging even though our beliefs about truth may change.

Therefore, as we seek to understand what God is like, we are simply seeking to discover truths that already exist.

### God's Existence

First and foremost, the Bible asserts that God exists. It does not argue for His existence; it simply states it. The fact that God exists should be self-evident through the works He has created ([Psalm 19:1-6](https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/19/Psalm-19-1.html)). [Genesis 1:1](https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/1/Genesis-1-1.html) declares, "In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth." This simple yet powerful statement reveals that God created the entire universe, including time, space, matter, and energy, by His own decree.

Albert Einstein's Theory of General Relativity affirms that all time, space, and matter had a definite, simultaneous beginning. According to the law of causality, what has a beginning has a cause. Therefore, God serves as the ultimate cause behind the existence of all things. He is not only the creator of everything but also almighty ([Joel 1:15](https://www.bibleref.com/Joel/1/Joel-1-15.html)), eternally self-existent ([Psalm 90:2](https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/90/Psalm-90-2.html)), and beyond everything in creation ([Psalm 97:9](https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/97/Psalm-97-9.html)).

Furthermore, the same God who created all things also exercises control over them. He is sovereign ([Isaiah 46:10](https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/46/Isaiah-46-10.html)). A person who creates something owns it and possesses the authority to utilize it as they see fit. As [Isaiah 44:24](https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/44/Isaiah-44-24.html) states, God is the One "who has made all things, who alone stretched out the heavens, who spread out the earth by myself." The following verse emphasizes that He can overthrow the knowledge of the wise and render it meaningless. Clearly, God possesses the power to do as He pleases.

### The Nature of God

God is not a physical being that can be represented by any created thing. In fact, any attempt to create such a representation is considered blasphemous ([Exodus 20:4-6](https://www.bibleref.com/Exodus/20/Exodus-20-4.html)). Instead, God is spirit ([John 4:24](https://www.bibleref.com/John/4/John-4-24.html)), existing in a non-physical form. He is unchanging ([Malachi 3:6](https://www.bibleref.com/Malachi/3/Malachi-3-6.html)), meaning His character and attributes remain constant throughout time.

God is all-knowing ([1 John 3:20](https://www.bibleref.com/1-John/3/1-John-3-20.html)) and present everywhere ([Psalm 139:7-13](https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/139/Psalm-139-7.html)). His knowledge encompasses everything, and He is present in every corner of creation. Additionally, God is holy and glorious ([Isaiah 6:3](https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/6/Isaiah-6-3.html)), meaning He is set apart and possesses an awe-inspiring majesty. He is just ([Deuteronomy 32:4](https://www.bibleref.com/Deuteronomy/32/Deuteronomy-32-4.html)) and will righteously judge all sin and unrighteousness ([Jude 1:15](https://www.bibleref.com/Jude/1/Jude-1-15.html)).

The concept of God's judgment highlights another important aspect of His nature: He is a moral being. C. S. Lewis, in his book "Mere Christianity," argues that just as there are observable laws of nature (such as gravity and entropy), there are also observable laws of morality. Lewis states, "First, that human beings, all over the earth, have this curious idea that they ought to behave in a certain way, and cannot really get rid of it. Secondly, that they do not in fact behave in that way. They know the Law of Nature; they break it." This universal belief in right and wrong reflects the nature of God who created us in His image ([Genesis 1:26](https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/1/Genesis-1-26.html); [Ecclesiastes 3:11](https://www.bibleref.com/Ecclesiastes/3/Ecclesiastes-3-11.html)).

### Jesus Reveals God

Jesus Christ, during His time on Earth, provided a unique glimpse into the nature of God. He declared that anyone who had seen Him had seen the Father ([John 14:7-9](https://www.bibleref.com/John/14/John-14-7.html)). Through Jesus, we come to understand that God seeks to save the lost ([Luke 19:10](https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/19/Luke-19-10.html)). He embodies compassion ([Matthew 14:14](https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/14/Matthew-14-14.html)), mercy ([Luke 6:36](https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/6/Luke-6-36.html)), and forgiveness ([Matthew 9:1-8](https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/9/Matthew-9-1.html)). Simultaneously, Jesus revealed that God would judge unrepentant sin ([Luke 13:5](https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/13/Luke-13-5.html)) and expressed His anger towards those who lived falsely and refused to acknowledge the truth (Matthew 23).

Above all, Jesus demonstrated that God is love ([1 John 4:8](https://www.bibleref.com/1-John/4/1-John-4-8.html)). Out of love, God sent His Son into the world ([John 3:16](https://www.bibleref.com/John/3/John-3-16.html)), who willingly died on the cross for sinners ([Romans 5:8](https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/5/Romans-5-8.html)). It is through love that God still calls sinners to repentance and offers the grace to be called children of God ([1 John 3:1](https://www.bibleref.com/1-John/3/1-John-3-1.html)).

### Why This Matters

Understanding what God is like has significant implications for our lives. Recognizing that God exists and is in control reminds us that we are not alone or without purpose. It also reaffirms our need to acknowledge Him as the ultimate authority in our lives.

Realizing that God is a moral being helps us understand the importance of living according to His standards. It prompts us to seek righteousness and avoid sinful behaviors. Moreover, comprehending that God is love encourages us to embrace His forgiveness, grace, and mercy in our lives.

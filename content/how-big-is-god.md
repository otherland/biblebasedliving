## How Big is God?

When we ask the question, "How big is God?" we may encounter different answers depending on the context. In children's Sunday school, the common response is that God is "bigger than you can imagine!" While this answer may satisfy the curiosity of young minds, it leaves us wondering about the nature of God's size in a more philosophical and metaphysical sense.

It is important to note that God cannot be measured in terms of physical dimensions because He is not made of material substances. He exists outside of our physical world and is preexistent and eternal ([Revelation 22:13](https://www.bibleref.com/Revelation/22/Revelation-22-13.html)). God is not a created being but is existence itself. He transcends space and time, and therefore, spatial descriptions do not apply to Him.

God is described as "spirit" ([John 4:24](https://www.bibleref.com/John/4/John-4-24.html)), which means He does not have a physical or material form. This concept can be challenging for us to grasp since we are accustomed to thinking in terms of length, depth, and height. Our perception of reality is closely tied to the material world, and we often rely on measuring devices and units to understand things better. However, when it comes to measuring God, we face a significant obstacle because He is immaterial and immeasurable. He exists infinitely in every way and cannot be quantified or fully comprehended by human means.

Despite our limitations in understanding God's vastness, we can find comfort in knowing that He loves us and has revealed Himself through His Word and His Son, Jesus Christ. We are created in His image ([Genesis 1:27](https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/1/Genesis-1-27.html)), and His love for us is demonstrated through the sacrifice of Jesus ([John 3:16](https://www.bibleref.com/John/3/John-3-16.html)). While we may never fully grasp the magnitude of God's being, we can rest assured that He is "big" enough to create the universe and "small" enough to intimately know and love each one of us.

### Why This Matters

Understanding the concept of God's size has profound implications for our faith and worldview. It reminds us that God is beyond human comprehension and defies our attempts to fit Him into our limited understanding. Recognizing the immeasurability of God's being prompts us to approach Him with awe, reverence, and humility. It encourages us to seek a deeper relationship with Him, knowing that He is greater than anything we can imagine.

### Think About It

1. How does the idea of God's immeasurability challenge your perception of Him?
2. In what ways can acknowledging God's vastness enhance your worship and devotion?
3. How does the concept of God's infinite nature affect your understanding of His love for you?

### Key Points

1. God is not made of material substances, so He has no physical dimensions.
2. God is preexistent, eternal, and transcends space and time.
3. As a spiritual being, God does not possess a physical or material form.
4. Our tendency to measure and quantify things cannot be applied to God, as He is immaterial and immeasurable.
5. Despite our limitations in understanding God's vastness, He has revealed Himself through His Word and His Son, Jesus Christ.
6. God's immeasurable nature invites us to approach Him with reverence and humility while deepening our relationship with Him.

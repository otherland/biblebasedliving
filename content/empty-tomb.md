## The Empty Tomb: Evidence of the Resurrection

The reality of the empty tomb has been central to the Christian proclamation since the earliest apostolic period. All four Gospels describe the circumstances surrounding the discovery of the empty tomb. But are there good reasons to believe that these claims are historically accurate? In this article, we will explore several arguments that have convinced many historians that Jesus' tomb was indeed found empty on the Sunday following His crucifixion.

### 1. The Known Location of Jesus' Tomb

Jesus' burial by Joseph of Arimathea is unlikely to have been a Christian fabrication. Joseph was a member of the Sanhedrin, the group responsible for Jesus' execution. It is highly unlikely that Jesus' followers would have invented a tradition about a Sanhedrin member using his own tomb to provide Jesus with a respectable burial. Recent archaeological discoveries also demonstrate that the style of tomb described in the Gospels was mainly used by wealthy individuals and people of prominence, which aligns with what we know about Joseph of Arimathea. The fact that no competing burial tradition exists further supports the conclusion that Jesus was buried in Joseph's tomb.

**Why This Matters:** The known location of Jesus' tomb, as well as its association with a member of the Sanhedrin, adds credibility to the claim that Jesus' tomb was empty.

**Think About It:** If the Jewish authorities knew the location of Jesus' tomb, why did they not produce His corpse to refute the Christian movement's claims? The absence of a corpse in the tomb suggests that Christianity began gaining converts in Jerusalem because Jesus' tomb was indeed empty.

### 2. Early Oral Formula Implying an Empty Tomb

The Apostle Paul quotes an oral formula in his letter to the Corinthians, which he received from Peter and James just five years after Jesus' crucifixion. The formula states that Christ died, was buried, and was raised on the third day. Paul's use of the phrase "that he was buried, that he was raised" implies that the tomb in which Jesus was buried was empty. As a former Pharisee, Paul would have understood that burial precedes resurrection. This oral formula, originating from the Jerusalem apostles, provides strong evidence that Jesus' tomb had been found empty and was widely known in the early Christian community.

**Why This Matters:** The early oral formula quoted by Paul implies that the tomb of Jesus was empty, reinforcing the idea that Jesus' resurrection was bodily in nature.

**Think About It:** If there was no empty tomb, Paul's claim of physical resurrection would have been contradictory. The empty tomb supports the credibility of Paul's teaching on Jesus' bodily resurrection.

### 3. Enemy Attestation of an Empty Tomb

The Gospel of Matthew reports an acknowledgment of the empty tomb by Jewish leaders themselves. They claimed that the disciples had stolen Jesus' body. If Matthew were lying, this report could have easily been discredited during his lifetime since many contemporaries were still alive when his Gospel circulated. The fact that the Jewish leaders accused the disciples of stealing the body presupposes that the tomb was indeed empty. This acknowledgement is also mentioned by Christian apologists Justin Martyr and Tertullian, who interacted with Jewish debaters in the second century. Their independent accounts corroborate the existence of an early Jewish acknowledgement of an empty tomb.

**Why This Matters:** Enemy attestation to an empty tomb adds credibility to its historicity, as it would have been easy to disprove if untrue.

**Think About It:** If the tomb still contained Jesus' body, why would the Jewish leaders accuse the disciples of stealing it? The counter-accusation made by the Jews presupposes an empty tomb.

### 4. Women as Primary Witnesses

All four Gospels report that women were the first witnesses of the empty tomb. In first-century Jewish society, women's testimony was considered less reliable than that of men. If the early Christians were fabricating a story to persuade others of Jesus' resurrection, they would not have used women as primary witnesses. The Gospels depict Jesus' male disciples as fearful and hiding, while women were the earliest witnesses. The inclusion of women as primary witnesses suggests that they truly were the initial witnesses of the empty tomb.

**Why This Matters:** The use of women as primary witnesses, despite societal norms, adds credibility to the claim of an empty tomb.

**Think About It:** Why would the early Christians portray their male leaders as cowards and place females in the role of primary witnesses? This suggests that they were unwilling to lie about the empty tomb, even though it may have been seen as embarrassing.

### Conclusion

All these arguments contribute to the cumulative proof that Jesus' tomb was empty on the first Easter. Historian Michael Grant, a skeptic of Jesus' resurrection, concluded that if we apply the same criteria used for other ancient literary sources, the evidence supports an empty tomb. However, an empty tomb is only part of the story. The reason for its emptiness is that Jesus rose from the dead. His resurrection was witnessed by numerous individuals and groups, providing sure proof that He is the risen Son of God and our only hope of salvation.

As Christians, reflecting on the evidence for the empty tomb strengthens our faith in the bodily resurrection of Jesus. It reminds us that our hope is not in vain and encourages us to share this hope with others. The empty tomb is not just a historical event; it is a powerful reminder of God's love and redemption for all who believe in Him.

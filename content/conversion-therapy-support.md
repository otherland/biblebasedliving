## Conversion Therapy Support: A Biblical Perspective

In recent years, the topic of conversion therapy has gained significant attention and sparked intense debate. As Christians, it is essential for us to approach this issue from a biblical perspective, rooted in the timeless truths of God's Word. In this article, we will explore [eight key questions](/political-and-economic-perspectives) about conversion therapy and provide biblically-grounded answers that uphold traditional Christian values.

## 1. What is conversion therapy?

Conversion therapy, also known as reparative therapy or ex-gay therapy, refers to practices aimed at changing an individual's sexual orientation or gender identity. These therapies typically involve attempts to help individuals with same-sex attractions embrace a heterosexual identity or suppress their feelings altogether. While some proponents of conversion therapy claim it can be effective, the scientific community widely discredits these practices.

### Biblical Perspective:

As Christians, we believe that God's design for human sexuality is clear in Scripture. In [Genesis 2:24](https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/2/Genesis-2-24.html), God establishes the foundation for marriage: "Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother and hold fast to his wife, and they shall become one flesh." This passage affirms the biblical understanding that marriage is between one man and one woman.

Moreover, the Bible consistently condemns sexual immorality, including homosexual behavior. In [Leviticus 18:22](https://www.bibleref.com/Leviticus/18/Leviticus-18-22.html), God explicitly states, "You shall not lie with a male as with a woman; it is an abomination." The New Testament reaffirms this view in passages such as [Romans 1:26-27](https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/1/Romans-1-26.html) and [1 Corinthians 6:9-10](https://www.bibleref.com/1-Corinthians/6/1-Corinthians-6-9.html).

Based on these biblical teachings, conversion therapy seeks to align individuals with God's intended design for human sexuality by helping them overcome same-sex attractions and embrace heterosexual relationships.

## 2. Is conversion therapy effective?

There is significant debate regarding the effectiveness of conversion therapy. While some individuals claim to have experienced changes in their sexual orientation through these therapies, the scientific consensus is that conversion therapy is not effective and can be harmful.

### Biblical Perspective:

As Christians, we believe that true transformation comes through a personal relationship with Jesus Christ. The Bible teaches that when we surrender our lives to Him, He begins a process of sanctification, transforming us from the inside out. While conversion therapy may have limited success stories, our ultimate hope for transformation rests in the power of the Gospel and the work of [the Holy Spirit](/uk-christian-identity).

[Romans 12:2](https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/12/Romans-12-2.html) exhorts believers, "Do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewal of your mind, that by testing you may discern what is the will of God, what is good and acceptable and perfect." This transformation occurs through the renewing of our minds according to God's Word, not through external interventions.

While conversion therapy may offer temporary changes, it is essential to pursue lasting transformation through a vibrant relationship with Jesus Christ and reliance on the Holy Spirit's guidance.

## 3. What are the dangers of conversion therapy?


<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/maBBfiYW-C4" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>


Critics argue that conversion therapy can be harmful to individuals who undergo these practices. They claim that it can lead to feelings of shame, anxiety, depression, and even suicidal ideation. These concerns highlight the importance of approaching this issue with sensitivity and care.

### Biblical Perspective:

As Christians, we are called to love and care for one another. [Galatians 6:2](https://www.bibleref.com/Galatians/6/Galatians-6-2.html) instructs us to "bear one another's burdens," emphasizing the importance of providing support and encouragement to those struggling with their sexual orientation or gender identity.

While some individuals may report negative experiences with conversion therapy, it is crucial to recognize that any form of counseling or therapy has the potential for harm if not conducted responsibly and ethically. As Christians, we should prioritize providing compassionate care that upholds biblical principles while respecting individuals' autonomy and mental well-being.

## 4. What does the scientific community say about conversion therapy?

The scientific community overwhelmingly rejects conversion therapy as ineffective and potentially harmful. Numerous professional organizations, including the American Psychological Association and the American Medical Association, have issued statements condemning the practice.

### Biblical Perspective:

While scientific research can provide valuable insights, it is essential to remember that our ultimate authority as Christians is God's Word. Scripture guides us in matters of faith, morality, and human sexuality. While scientific consensus may evolve over time, we can rely on the unchanging truths of God's Word as our foundation.

[Psalm 119:105](https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/119/Psalm-119-105.html) reminds us, "Your word is a lamp to my feet and a light to my path." As Christians, we should prioritize aligning our beliefs and actions with the teachings of Scripture rather than being swayed solely by scientific opinions.

## 5. Are there alternative approaches to supporting individuals struggling with their sexual orientation or gender identity?

While conversion therapy may not be the ideal approach, there are alternative ways to support individuals who are grappling with their sexual orientation or gender identity. Providing a safe and nonjudgmental environment where individuals can explore their feelings and experiences is crucial.

### Biblical Perspective:

As Christians, our primary goal should be to reflect Christ's love and compassion toward all people. Jesus Himself demonstrates this in His interactions with individuals who experienced rejection or marginalization. He offers acceptance, forgiveness, and hope to those who come to Him.

When engaging with individuals struggling with their sexual orientation or gender identity, it is essential to listen attentively, offer emotional support, and provide resources that align with biblical values. Rather than seeking to change someone's sexual orientation or gender identity, our focus should be on pointing them to Christ and encouraging them in their journey of faith.

## 6. How can faith communities respond to the issue of conversion therapy?

Faith communities play a vital role in addressing the issue of conversion therapy. They can create spaces where individuals feel safe and supported, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity.

### Biblical Perspective:

The Church is called to be a place of refuge and healing for all people. It should be a community where individuals can find acceptance, love, and spiritual guidance. As Christians, we are called to extend grace and compassion to those who are struggling, just as Christ has shown us.

[James 2:8](https://www.bibleref.com/James/2/James-2-8.html) reminds us, "If you really fulfill the royal law according to the Scripture, 'You shall love your neighbor as yourself,' you are doing well." Faith communities should strive to create an atmosphere of love, grace, and acceptance, where individuals can explore their faith and seek God's guidance in their lives.

## 7. How can individuals who have undergone conversion therapy find healing and support?

Individuals who have experienced conversion therapy may carry emotional wounds and struggle with their faith. It is crucial for them to find healing and support within a loving community that understands their unique experiences.

### Biblical Perspective:

God's Word assures us that He is a God of healing and restoration. [Psalm 147:3](https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/147/Psalm-147-3.html) declares, "He heals the brokenhearted and binds up their wounds." As Christians, we should walk alongside these individuals, offering them empathy, understanding, and biblical counsel.

Support groups, counseling from trained professionals, and involvement in healthy Christian communities can provide avenues for healing. By embracing the transformative power of the Gospel and finding solace in God's unconditional love, individuals can experience true healing and restoration.

## 8. How can we engage with the broader society on the issue of conversion therapy?

Engaging with the broader society on the issue of conversion therapy requires wisdom and discernment. It is crucial to articulate our beliefs in a winsome and respectful manner while standing firm in our commitment to biblical truth.

### Biblical Perspective:

In a world that often rejects biblical values, we must remember that our primary allegiance is to Christ. We are called to be salt and light, shining God's truth in a world that desperately needs it.

[1 Peter 3:15](https://www.bibleref.com/1-Peter/3/1-Peter-3-15.html) urges us, "But in your hearts honor Christ the Lord as holy, always being prepared to make a defense to anyone who asks you for a reason for the hope that is in you; yet do it with gentleness and respect." When engaging with others, we should approach conversations with humility, grace, and a sincere desire to share the transformative power of the Gospel.

Conclusion:

As Christians, our understanding of human sexuality and gender identity is rooted in the timeless teachings of Scripture. While conversion therapy remains a controversial subject, we must approach it with biblical wisdom, compassion, and a commitment to upholding [traditional Christian values](/covenant-marriage-promotion). By pointing individuals toward [the transformative power](/uk-christian-identity) of Jesus Christ and providing support and care within faith communities, we can offer hope and healing to those grappling with their sexual orientation or gender identity.

Title: 'Unveiling the Divine Truth: Little Lower Angels Revealed'

## Little Lower Than the Angels

The concept of being "a little lower than the angels" is found in [Psalm 8:5](https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/8/Psalm-8-5.html), and it holds significant implications for our understanding of Jesus Christ. In this verse, the psalmist ponders the greatness of God's creation and asks, "What is man that you are mindful of him, and the son of man that you care for him?" The psalmist goes on to acknowledge that God has made humanity "a little lower than the heavenly beings" and has crowned them with glory and honor.

### The Original Meaning

To grasp the original meaning of this verse, we need to consider its context. In Hebrew, the term "heavenly beings" can also be translated as "angel." Therefore, [Psalm 8:5](https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/8/Psalm-8-5.html) suggests that God has made humanity slightly lower than the angels. The following verse, [Psalm 8:6](https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/8/Psalm-8-6.html), further emphasizes that God has given mankind dominion over His creation.

This understanding aligns with [Genesis 1:26-28](https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/1/Genesis-1-26.html), which reveals that God gave humanity authority over the created world. Adam, as the representative head of the human race, was created "a little lower than the angels." Despite this positioning, Adam was still crowned with glory and honor because he was made in the image of God.

### Jesus as the Second Adam

[Hebrews 2:6-8](https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/2/Hebrews-2-6.html) quotes [Psalm 8:5](https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/8/Psalm-8-5.html) and expands upon its significance. The author of Hebrews applies this verse to Jesus Christ, identifying Him as the "son of man" mentioned in [Psalm 8:4](https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/8/Psalm-8-4.html). By doing so, Hebrews emphasizes Jesus' connection to Adam as the representative head of humanity.

Jesus is referred to as the Second Adam or the new Adam who came to deal directly with the consequences brought upon mankind by the first Adam. This includes conquering death, which the first Adam could never accomplish ([1 Corinthians 15:45](https://www.bibleref.com/1-Corinthians/15/1-Corinthians-15-45.html)). The Gospel of Luke also emphasizes Jesus as the Son of Man, the one who came to deliver mankind from death through His crucifixion, burial, and resurrection.

### Jesus' Incarnation and Humility

Jesus, in His incarnation, took on sinless flesh and willingly became "a little lower than the angels." [Philippians 2:7](https://www.bibleref.com/Philippians/2/Philippians-2-7.html) describes how Jesus "made himself nothing by taking the very nature of a servant" when He took on human form. He subjected Himself to the Law and lived in perfect obedience ([Galatians 4:4](https://www.bibleref.com/Galatians/4/Galatians-4-4.html)). Jesus, who was rich, became poor for our sake ([2 Corinthians 8:9](https://www.bibleref.com/2-Corinthians/8/2-Corinthians-8-9.html)). In [Matthew 20:28](https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/20/Matthew-20-28.html), Jesus declared that He came not to be served but to serve and give His life as a ransom for many.

The angels themselves marvel at the Incarnation and desire to understand the gospel more fully ([1 Peter 1:12](https://www.bibleref.com/1-Peter/1/1-Peter-1-12.html)). Despite becoming "a little lower than the angels," Jesus never ceased to be God. He displayed the meekness and condescension of God while remaining fully divine. After His atoning work on the cross, Jesus was crowned with glory and honor. He is now seated at the right hand of God the Father ([Colossians 3:1](https://www.bibleref.com/Colossians/3/Colossians-3-1.html)).

### The Exaltation of Jesus

While Jesus was made lower than the angels for a temporary period, [Hebrews 2:7](https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/2/Hebrews-2-7.html) assures us that He is now exalted above all angels. [Philippians 2:9-11](https://www.bibleref.com/Philippians/2/Philippians-2-9.html) declares that every knee will bow before Him, and every tongue will confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God the Father.

Believers in Christ will also reign with Him in the future millennium. As the Second Adam, Christ will accomplish what the first Adam and his descendants failed to achieve due to sin. [Hebrews 2:8](https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/2/Hebrews-2-8.html) hints at this by pointing out the subjection of all things to Christ. The curse will be reversed, and believers will share in Christ's glory forever, dwelling with Him in the new heaven and new earth ([Isaiah 65:17-25](https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/65/Isaiah-65-17.html)).

### Why This Matters

Understanding Jesus' role as the Second Adam and His humility in becoming "a little lower than the angels" is crucial for Christians. It highlights Jesus' humanity and His unique ability to represent humanity before God. Jesus' incarnation and sacrificial death on the cross provide the means for our redemption and salvation. Without Jesus' willingness to humble Himself and take on human form, there would be no hope of salvation for any of us.

### Think About It

Contemplating Jesus' humility can inspire us to adopt a servant mindset. Just as Jesus came not to be served but to serve, we are called to follow His example. We should consider how we can humbly serve others, imitating Jesus' selflessness in our interactions with those around us. Additionally, reflecting on Jesus' exaltation reminds us of the ultimate victory that awaits believers in Christ. It encourages us to persevere in faith, knowing that our future is secure and that we will share in Christ's glory forever.

In conclusion, [Psalm 8:5](https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/8/Psalm-8-5.html) speaks of humanity being "a little lower than the angels," which finds its fulfillment in Jesus Christ as the Second Adam. Jesus willingly took on human form, experiencing humility and ultimately achieving victory over sin and death. Understanding this truth deepens our appreciation for Jesus' sacrifice and underscores the importance of imitating His humility and service to others.

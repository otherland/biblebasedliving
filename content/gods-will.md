## God's Will

Understanding God's will can be complex, but it can be broken down into three aspects: His sovereign will, His revealed will, and His dispositional will. Each aspect provides insights into how God's will operates in the world.

### 1. God's Sovereign Will

God's sovereign will, also known as His hidden will, reveals His role as the ruler of the universe who ordains all that happens. It encompasses God's decrees and is often unknown to us until it unfolds. Nothing occurs outside of God's sovereign will. For example, Joseph being taken to Egypt, imprisoned, and eventually becoming a savior to his people was part of God's sovereign will (Genesis 37â€“50). This aspect of God's will can be further divided into two categories: His efficacious will and His permissive will.

God's efficacious will directly contributes to the fulfillment of His desires, while His permissive will allows for an indirect fulfillment of His desires. Although God permits events and happenings, it does not mean He directly causes everything to happen. An example of God's permissive will is seen in the story of Joseph and his brothers. God allowed Joseph to be kidnapped and enslaved by his brothers, which was a sinful act. However, God used this situation for a greater purpose ([Genesis 50:20](https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/50/Genesis-50-20.html)).

**Why This Matters:** Understanding God's sovereign will helps us recognize that nothing happens outside of His control. Even when we face difficult circumstances or encounter evil, we can trust that God is still at work according to His purposes.

**Think About It:** How does knowing that God is in control of all things impact your trust in Him during challenging times?

### 2. God's Revealed Will

God's revealed will refers to what He has made known to us through the Bible. It includes His precepts or commands that guide our actions and behavior. God's revealed will is not hidden from us but is plainly stated in Scripture. For example, [Micah 6:8](https://www.bibleref.com/Micah/6/Micah-6-8.html) tells us that God requires us to act justly, love mercy, and walk humbly with Him. We also know that God's revealed will includes commands such as speaking the truth in love ([Ephesians 4:15](https://www.bibleref.com/Ephesians/4/Ephesians-4-15.html)), repenting and turning to God ([Acts 3:19](https://www.bibleref.com/Acts/3/Acts-3-19.html)), avoiding adultery ([1 Corinthians 6:18](https://www.bibleref.com/1-Corinthians/6/1-Corinthians-6-18.html)), and refraining from drunkenness ([Ephesians 5:18](https://www.bibleref.com/Ephesians/5/Ephesians-5-18.html)).

**Why This Matters:** God's revealed will provides us with guidance for living a life that pleases Him. It helps us understand what is right and wrong according to His standards.

**Think About It:** How does following God's revealed will impact your relationships with others and your personal character?

### 3. God's Dispositional Will

God's dispositional will refers to His attitude or desires. It reveals what pleases or displeases Him. For example, [1 Timothy 2:4](https://www.bibleref.com/1-Timothy/2/1-Timothy-2-4.html) states that God wants all people to be saved and come to a knowledge of the truth. This expresses His disposition towards the lost; He desires their salvation. However, while God's heart desires all to be saved, not all choose to accept His offer of salvation.

**Why This Matters:** Recognizing God's dispositional will helps us understand His heart for humanity. It reminds us of His desire for people to experience His love and salvation.

**Think About It:** How does understanding God's dispositional will impact your view of His love for humanity and your role in sharing the Gospel?

### Conclusion

Understanding God's will involves recognizing these three aspects: His sovereign will, revealed will, and dispositional will. Each aspect provides valuable insights into how God works in the world and our lives. While these concepts may seem complex at first, breaking them down into simpler terms allows us to grasp the depth of God's will and its significance for our faith.

In summary, God's sovereign will showcases His control over all things, His revealed will guides our actions and behavior, and His dispositional will reveals His desires and attitude towards humanity. Embracing these aspects of God's will leads us to a deeper understanding of His character and purpose for our lives.

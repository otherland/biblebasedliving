## God's Sense of Humor

Humor is a universal human experience that brings joy and laughter. As beings created in the image of God ([Genesis 1:27](https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/1/Genesis-1-27.html)), it is reasonable to consider whether God also possesses a sense of humor. The American Heritage Dictionary defines a "sense of humor" as the ability to perceive, enjoy, or express what is comical or funny. Therefore, if we believe that humans are capable of perceiving and expressing humor, it follows that God must also possess this ability.

However, it is important to note that what sinful man perceives as funny may not amuse a holy and perfect God. Much of what the world considers humor is crass, crude, and should have no place in a Christian's life ([Colossians 3:8](https://www.bibleref.com/Colossians/3/Colossians-3-8.html)). Additionally, humor expressed at the expense of others, tearing them down instead of building them up, goes against God's Word ([Colossians 4:6](https://www.bibleref.com/Colossians/4/Colossians-4-6.html); [Ephesians 4:29](https://www.bibleref.com/Ephesians/4/Ephesians-4-29.html)). 

### Humor in Scripture

While the Bible does not explicitly state that God has a sense of humor, there are instances where His actions can be seen as humorous. For example, when the Philistines captured the Ark of the Covenant and placed it before their idol Dagon in their temple, they found Dagon flat on his face the next day. They set him back up, only for him to be found decapitated the following morning ([1 Samuel 5:1-5](https://www.bibleref.com/1-Samuel/5/1-Samuel-5-1.html)). This comical picture illustrates God's power and supremacy over false gods. In [Psalm 59:7-8](https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/59/Psalm-59-7.html), we see God laughing at those who oppose Him and spew out swords from their lips. Similarly, Psalm 2 portrays God laughing at those who rebel against His kingship. 

### The Serious Side

While these instances may seem amusing on the surface, there is a serious side to them as well. God takes no delight in the waywardness and its consequences of those who oppose Him but rather desires to see them turn around ([Ezekiel 33:11](https://www.bibleref.com/Ezekiel/33/Ezekiel-33-11.html); [Matthew 23:37-38](https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/23/Matthew-23-37.html)). Just as one would not crack jokes in the presence of someone who has lost a loved one, God is focused on the lost and seeks those who will care for their souls. Therefore, while our lives can have times of refreshing and humor, they are also to be characterized by seriousness about making our lives count for Christ ([1 Thessalonians 5:6](https://www.bibleref.com/1-Thessalonians/5/1-Thessalonians-5-6.html),8; [Titus 2:2](https://www.bibleref.com/Titus/2/Titus-2-2.html),6).

### Why This Matters

Understanding whether God has a sense of humor can deepen our relationship with Him. Recognizing that humor is a reflection of our Creator can help us appreciate the joy and laughter He has given us. Additionally, it reminds us to align our sense of humor with biblical principles, avoiding crass and hurtful humor.

### Think About It

1. How does recognizing God's sense of humor impact your view of Him?
2. How can we cultivate a sense of humor that reflects biblical principles?
3. Can you think of any instances in your own life where God's sense of humor was evident?

In conclusion, while the Bible does not explicitly state that God has a sense of humor, there are instances where His actions can be seen as humorous. However, it is crucial to approach humor with discernment, ensuring that it aligns with biblical principles. Recognizing God's sense of humor can deepen our relationship with Him and help us appreciate the joy and laughter He has given us.

## God is Truth

### Introduction
The statement "God is truth" refers to one of the moral attributes of God. It means that truth itself proceeds from the nature of God. While many things can have truth, only one thing can be the ultimate truth, which is God Himself.

### The Attributes of God
The attributes of God can be categorized into nonmoral and moral attributes. Nonmoral attributes refer to aspects like eternality, infinity, and omnipotence. Moral attributes, on the other hand, include characteristics like truth. When we say "God is truth," we are acknowledging that truth is a moral attribute that stems from the nature of God.

### Scripture Affirming God as Truth
The Bible directly refers to God as truth in various places. Jesus Himself said, "I am the way, and the truth, and the life" ([John 14:6](https://www.bibleref.com/John/14/John-14-6.html)), and He also referred to the Holy Spirit as "the Spirit of truth" ([John 14:17](https://www.bibleref.com/John/14/John-14-17.html); 15:26; 16:13). Additionally, [Hebrews 6:18](https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/6/Hebrews-6-18.html) states that it is impossible for God to lie.

### Understanding Truth in Scripture
In the Bible, the Hebrew term for "truth" is emet, which encompasses meanings like "truth," "firmness," "stability," and "faithfulness." The Greek word for "truth" is aletheia, which denotes concepts such as "truth," "sincerity," "straightforwardness," or "reality." These terms, along with other attributes of God like His immutability (inability to change), infinity, and simplicity (cannot be partly anything), help us understand that God Himself is absolute truth. His truth is unchanging and reliable.

### The Relationship Between Truth and Righteousness
One often overlooked aspect of truth in Scripture is its synonymous relationship with righteousness. In [Romans 2:8](https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/2/Romans-2-8.html), Paul refers to those who "do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness." He further highlights the equality between unrighteousness and lies and righteousness and truth in [Romans 3:5](https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/3/Romans-3-5.html), 7. This reveals that God's moral attribute of truth is inseparable from His attribute of holiness.

### Why This Matters
Understanding that God is truth has profound implications for our lives as Christians. It means that we can trust in the unchanging nature of God's truth. In a world where opinions and perspectives may vary, we have an anchor in the unchanging character of God. This truth serves as a guide for our decisions and actions, providing us with a solid foundation.

### Think About It
Consider the significance of having a source of truth that is unwavering and reliable. How does knowing that God is truth impact your understanding of His Word? How does it influence the way you live your life? Reflect on how you can align yourself with God's truth in your thoughts, words, and actions.

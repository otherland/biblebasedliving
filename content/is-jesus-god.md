Title: Is Jesus Truly God? Exploring the Divine Nature of Christ
---

## Is Jesus God?

Many people wonder whether Jesus is truly God. While the Bible does not include a direct statement from Jesus saying, "I am God," there are several passages that strongly indicate His divine nature. For example, in [John 10:30](https://www.bibleref.com/John/10/John-10-30.html), Jesus declares, "I and the Father are one." The Jews who heard this statement understood that He was claiming to be God, and they wanted to stone Him for blasphemy. Likewise, in [John 8:58](https://www.bibleref.com/John/8/John-8-58.html), Jesus says, "Before Abraham was born, I am!" This references [Exodus 3:14](https://www.bibleref.com/Exodus/3/Exodus-3-14.html) when God revealed Himself as the "I AM." The Jews again sought to kill Jesus for blasphemy.

The concept of Jesus' deity is reiterated throughout the New Testament. In [John 1:1](https://www.bibleref.com/John/1/John-1-1.html) and 14, we read that "the Word [Jesus] was God" and "the Word became flesh," indicating that Jesus is God in human form. [Acts 20:28](https://www.bibleref.com/Acts/20/Acts-20-28.html) tells us that the church was purchased with the blood of God, referring to Jesus. Furthermore, in [Hebrews 1:8](https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/1/Hebrews-1-8.html), the Father acknowledges Jesus as God when He says, "'Your throne, O God, will last forever and ever.'"

Even Thomas the disciple recognized Jesus as God when he exclaimed, "My Lord and my God" ([John 20:28](https://www.bibleref.com/John/20/John-20-28.html)), and Jesus did not correct him. Additionally, [Titus 2:13](https://www.bibleref.com/Titus/2/Titus-2-13.html) encourages believers to await the coming of "our God and Savior, Jesus Christ." In [Revelation 19:10](https://www.bibleref.com/Revelation/19/Revelation-19-10.html), an angel instructs John to worship only God. However, throughout the Gospels and other New Testament books, we find instances where people worship Jesus without Him rebuking them. If Jesus were not God, He would have surely corrected them.

One of the most crucial reasons why Jesus must be God is that His death would not have been sufficient to pay for the sins of the world if He were not God. Only God could pay an infinite penalty for sin against an infinite God. Jesus, being God incarnate, was able to take on the sins of the world, die, and be resurrected, triumphing over sin and death.

### Why This Matters

Understanding that Jesus is God is essential for our faith. If Jesus were merely a created being, He would not have been able to pay the price for our sins. As believers, we need assurance that our Savior is fully divine and capable of providing us with eternal salvation.

### Think About It

Consider the implications of Jesus' claim to be God. How does this affect your understanding of His work on the cross and the significance of His resurrection? How does it shape your relationship with Him? Take time to reflect on the profound truth that Jesus is God, and let it deepen your faith in Him.

Title: 'Why God Allows Handicapped Individuals: Understanding His Divine Plan'
---

## God's Purpose for Disabled and Handicapped Individuals

The Bible teaches us that God is the creator of all people, including those who are physically disabled or mentally handicapped. While it may be difficult to understand why God allows some individuals to be born with disabilities or to acquire them later in life, we can find answers within the framework of the theological/philosophical debate known as "the problem of evil" or "the problem of pain." This debate seeks to reconcile the existence of suffering and brokenness in the world with the goodness and perfection of God.

### 1. The Impact of Original Sin
Disabilities and handicaps are a result of the fallen nature of our world, which began with mankind's rebellion against God. Sin entered the world through disobedience, and with it came sickness, imperfection, and disease. While not every disability can be directly attributed to personal sin (as Jesus clarified in [John 9:1](https://www.bibleref.com/John/9/John-9-1.html)â€“3), generally speaking, disabilities and handicaps can be traced back to the existence of sin.

**Why This Matters:** Recognizing that disabilities are a consequence of living in a fallen world helps us understand that God did not design us to experience such limitations. It points us towards a future where we will be free from these afflictions.

**Think About It:** How does understanding the impact of sin on the world shape our perspective on disabilities? How can we show compassion and support to disabled individuals?

### 2. Displaying God's Works and Glory
God can use disabilities and handicaps as opportunities to display His works and bring glory to Himself. When Jesus encountered a man who was born blind, He explained that the man's condition existed so "that the works of God might be displayed in him" ([John 9:3](https://www.bibleref.com/John/9/John-9-3.html)). Through healing miracles, Jesus demonstrated His power and authority over physical limitations, leading many to believe in Him.

Similarly, when Lazarus fell ill, Jesus declared that his sickness was for the glory of God, so that people witnessing the miracle of his resurrection would believe ([John 11:4](https://www.bibleref.com/John/11/John-11-4.html)).

**Why This Matters:** Recognizing that God can use disabilities to display His power and bring people to faith encourages us to trust in Him even in the midst of physical limitations.

**Think About It:** How can we see God's works and glory displayed through disabled individuals today? How does this challenge our understanding of what it means to be "able-bodied"?

### 3. Learning to Trust in God
God allows disabilities and handicaps to teach us to rely on Him rather than on our own abilities. When God called Moses, who struggled with speech, Moses tried to use his disability as an excuse for not fulfilling God's call. However, God assured Moses that He would help him speak and teach him what to say. In doing so, God demonstrated that all human ability and disability are part of His plan.

**Why This Matters:** Disabilities remind us that our strength and abilities come from God. They prompt us to trust in His provision and guidance.

**Think About It:** How can we encourage disabled individuals to trust in God's strength and provision? How can we avoid underestimating their abilities or overemphasizing their disabilities?

### 4. Weakness as a Means of Strength
God often chooses the weak and broken things of this world to accomplish His purposes. The apostle Paul writes that God chose the foolish and weak things of the world to shame the wise and strong. By using the lowly and despised things, God nullifies human boasting.

**Why This Matters:** Recognizing that God can use disabilities as a means of demonstrating His power challenges societal norms and values. It reminds us that true strength comes from relying on God rather than relying solely on our physical or mental capabilities.

**Think About It:** How does society view disabilities, and how can we challenge those perceptions? How can we affirm the value and worth of disabled individuals as bearers of God's image?

### 5. Jesus' Identification with Human Weakness
When Jesus came into the world, He voluntarily took on the limitations and vulnerabilities of humanity. He left the perfection of heaven to live among sinners on earth. Jesus experienced human frailty, empathizing with our weaknesses. He suffered on our behalf, ultimately demonstrating His love and sacrifice on the cross.

**Why This Matters:** Understanding that Jesus willingly subjected Himself to weakness and suffering helps us find comfort and hope in His ability to empathize with our struggles.

**Think About It:** How does Jesus' identification with human weakness impact your understanding of your own limitations? How can this knowledge deepen your relationship with Him?

### 6. The Temporary Nature of Disabilities
God promises that disabilities and handicaps are temporary in light of eternity. They are part of this fallen world, not the world to come. When Jesus came the first time, He healed the sick, opened blind eyes, unstopped deaf ears, and made the lame leap for joy. These miracles give us a glimpse of the future restoration when Jesus returns.

**Why This Matters:** Recognizing that disabilities are temporary encourages us to look forward to a future where all physical limitations will cease to exist.

**Think About It:** How can the hope of future restoration impact our perspective on disabilities in the present? How can we support disabled individuals by pointing them towards this future hope?

In conclusion, while it may be challenging to understand why God allows disabilities and handicaps, we can trust that He has a purpose for each individual's circumstances. Disabilities remind us of the impact of sin in the world, provide opportunities for God's works and glory to be displayed, teach us to trust in Him, challenge societal norms, remind us of Jesus' identification with human weakness, and point us towards a future where disabilities will be no more. As we engage with disabled individuals, let us show compassion, support, and a recognition of their inherent value as bearers of God's image.

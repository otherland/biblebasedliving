## Resisting Secular Influence: A Biblical Perspective

Secular influence has become increasingly pervasive in our modern society, challenging [the Christian faith](/resisting-lgbtq-education) and traditional values. As believers, it is crucial that we understand how to resist secular influence and uphold biblical principles in every aspect of our lives. In this article, we will address [eight key questions](/protecting-young-minds) about resisting secular influence from a staunchly conservative, biblical perspective.

## Question 1: What is the nature of secularism and its impact on society?

Secularism is an ideology that seeks to separate religion from public life, promoting a worldview that excludes God and denies the authority of Scripture. Its impact on society can be seen in the erosion of moral values, the rejection of biblical truth, and the marginalization of religious beliefs. As Christians, we must recognize that secularism is fundamentally incompatible with our faith. 

*"Do not conform to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind. Then you will be able to test and approve what God's will is—his good, pleasing and perfect will."* - [Romans 12:2](https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/12/Romans-12-2.html)

Secularism seeks to redefine morality based on human reasoning rather than the unchanging truth of God's Word. We must resist this influence by standing firm on the authority of Scripture and upholding biblical values in our personal lives, families, and communities.

## Question 2: How can Christians counter secular humanism in literature?

In countering secular humanism in literature, Christians can play an active role by supporting and promoting literature that aligns with biblical principles. We should seek out books that promote godly virtues, provide moral guidance, and encourage a biblical worldview. By supporting Christian authors and publishers, we can ensure that wholesome literature is available to counter the secular humanistic worldview.

*"Finally, brothers and sisters, whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable—if anything is excellent or praiseworthy—think about such things."* - [Philippians 4:8](https://www.bibleref.com/Philippians/4/Philippians-4-8.html)

Additionally, we should engage in discerning reading, critically evaluating secular literature through the lens of Scripture. By analyzing the underlying worldview and discerning its alignment with biblical truth, we can identify and challenge secular humanistic ideas presented in literature.

## Question 3: How can Christians resist the influence of atheist authors and their works?

To resist the influence of atheist authors and their works, Christians must strengthen their knowledge of the Bible and apologetics. Familiarizing ourselves with logical arguments for the existence of God and sound biblical theology equips us to engage with atheist authors' claims effectively.

*"Always be prepared to give an answer to everyone who asks you to give the reason for the hope that you have. But do this with gentleness and respect."* - [1 Peter 3:15](https://www.bibleref.com/1-Peter/3/1-Peter-3-15.html)

Furthermore, we should actively seek out Christian literature that addresses atheistic arguments and provides compelling counterarguments from a biblical perspective. By engaging in rigorous study and equipping ourselves intellectually, we can effectively resist the influence of atheist authors.

## Question 4: How can Christians preserve the sacred in a secular culture?

Preserving the sacred in a secular culture requires intentional effort on the part of believers. We must prioritize our relationship with God and live out our faith authentically, even in the face of societal pressure to conform.

*"But as for you, continue in what you have learned and have become convinced of, because you know those from whom you learned it, and how from infancy you have known the Holy Scriptures, which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus."* - [2 Timothy 3:14-15](https://www.bibleref.com/2-Timothy/3/2-Timothy-3-14.html)

Practically, this involves actively participating in church activities, cultivating a personal devotional life, and nurturing relationships with fellow believers who share our commitment to biblical values. By immersing ourselves in Scripture and prayer, we can be empowered to live as salt and light in a secular culture.

## Question 5: How can Christians engage in faith-based critique of secular art?

Engaging in faith-based critique of secular art requires a discerning approach. As Christians, we should evaluate art through the lens of biblical truth, considering whether it aligns with or contradicts God's principles.

*"Test everything; hold fast what is good."* - [1 Thessalonians 5:21](https://www.bibleref.com/1-Thessalonians/5/1-Thessalonians-5-21.html)

We can engage in faith-based critique by evaluating the underlying worldview, moral messages, and themes presented in secular art. By engaging in constructive dialogue, we can raise awareness of the potential harm of secular art and promote alternative forms of artistic expression that align with biblical values.

## Question 6: How can Christians engage in spiritual warfare within creative industries?

Engaging in spiritual warfare within creative industries requires a firm commitment to prayer, discernment, and reliance on the Holy Spirit. We should pray for God's guidance and protection as we navigate this spiritually influential realm.

*"For though we live in the world, we do not wage war as the world does. The weapons we fight with are not the weapons of the world. On the contrary, they have divine power to demolish strongholds."* - [2 Corinthians 10:3-4](https://www.bibleref.com/2-Corinthians/10/2-Corinthians-10-3.html)

Furthermore, we should actively support Christian artists and creative professionals who boldly express their faith through their work. By providing platforms and opportunities for them to shine, we can impact the creative industries from within and counter secular influences.

## Question 7: What role does spiritual discernment play in resisting secular influence?

Spiritual discernment plays a crucial role in resisting secular influence. As Christians, we are called to discern between good and evil, truth and falsehood, and godly wisdom versus worldly wisdom.

*"But solid food is for the mature, who by constant use have trained themselves to distinguish good from evil."* - [Hebrews 5:14](https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/5/Hebrews-5-14.html)

We can cultivate spiritual discernment by immersing ourselves in God's Word and seeking the guidance of [the Holy Spirit](/10-essential-bible-verses-for-strength-and-encouragement). By developing a deep understanding of Scripture and relying on the Holy Spirit's wisdom, we can resist secular influences and make choices that align with God's will.

## Question 8: How can Christians navigate the tension between engaging with secular culture and preserving biblical values?

Navigating the tension between engaging with secular culture and preserving biblical values requires wisdom, discernment, and a steadfast commitment to biblical principles. While it is important to engage with the culture around us, we must do so without compromising our faith.

*"Do not love the world or anything in the world. If anyone loves the world, love for the Father is not in them."* - [1 John 2:15](https://www.bibleref.com/1-John/2/1-John-2-15.html)

We can navigate this tension by setting boundaries that align with biblical values and seeking God's guidance in every decision. By prayerfully evaluating cultural influences and placing our relationship with God above all else, we can engage with secular culture while remaining anchored in our faith.

In conclusion, as Christians, it is crucial that we resist secular influence by standing firm on the authority of Scripture, engaging in discerning reading, strengthening our knowledge of apologetics, prioritizing our relationship with God, critically evaluating art through a biblical lens, engaging in spiritual warfare within creative industries, cultivating spiritual discernment, and navigating the tension between secular culture and biblical values. By doing so, we can be faithful witnesses of Christ in a secular world and uphold biblical principles in all aspects of our lives.

## Jesus' Mission

Throughout his life, Jesus demonstrated that he was a man on a mission. He had a clear purpose and intentionally worked to fulfill it. Even at a young age, Jesus understood that he needed to be about his Father's business ([Luke 2:49](https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/2/Luke-2-49.html)). In the final days leading up to his crucifixion, Jesus resolutely set out for Jerusalem, fully aware of the fate that awaited him ([Luke 9:51](https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/9/Luke-9-51.html)). The fundamental mission of Jesus during his time on earth was to fulfill God's plan of saving the lost.

### Seeking and Saving the Lost
Jesus himself stated in [Luke 19:10](https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/19/Luke-19-10.html), "The Son of Man came to seek and to save the lost." He made this declaration after being criticized for associating with sinners. Jesus emphasized that his mission was not to avoid those who were considered sinful but to actively seek them out and offer salvation. He sought to forgive those whom the self-righteous leaders of the day rejected. This is evident in his interactions with individuals such as the woman at the well and the Samaritans from her town ([John 4:39](https://www.bibleref.com/John/4/John-4-39.html)–41), the sinful woman with the alabaster jar ([Luke 7:37](https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/7/Luke-7-37.html)), and even one of his own disciples, Matthew, who had been a tax collector ([Matthew 9:9](https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/9/Matthew-9-9.html)).

### Welcoming Sinners
In Matthew 9, Jesus once again faced criticism for eating with tax collectors and sinners. In response, he reiterated his mission by stating, "I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners" ([Matthew 9:13](https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/9/Matthew-9-13.html)). It becomes clear that Jesus's goal was to save people from their sins. He accomplished this mission by seeking out and forgiving even the worst of sinners. No one is too sinful to come to him. In fact, Jesus actively pursued those who were lost, as illustrated in the parables of the lost sheep and the lost coin ([Luke 15:1](https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/15/Luke-15-1.html)–10). In the story of the prodigal son, Jesus taught that God always welcomes those who come to him with a repentant heart ([Luke 15:21](https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/15/Luke-15-21.html)–22).

### The Work of Jesus
Jesus fulfilled his mission on earth, bringing glory to God by completing the work assigned to him ([John 17:4](https://www.bibleref.com/John/17/John-17-4.html)). Throughout the Gospels, we see Jesus calling people to repentance and offering forgiveness to even the most undeserving. This demonstrates God's love and grace for all humanity. Jesus's mission serves as an example of how we should approach those who are lost and in need of salvation. Just as Jesus sought and saved sinners, we are called to share the message of redemption and extend God's love to all.

#### Why This Matters
Understanding Jesus's mission helps us grasp the heart of Christianity. It reminds us that our faith is not just about following rules or being morally upright. Rather, it is about recognizing our own need for salvation and extending that same grace and love to others. Jesus's mission challenges us to reach out to those who may be considered outcasts or unworthy in society's eyes, just as he did.

#### Think About It
Consider how you can actively fulfill Jesus's mission in your own life. Are there people in your community or circle of influence who may feel lost or disconnected from God? How can you extend love, grace, and forgiveness to them, just as Jesus did? Take time to pray and seek God's guidance in reaching out to those who need salvation. Remember that no one is beyond redemption, and through your actions, you can reflect the heart of Jesus.

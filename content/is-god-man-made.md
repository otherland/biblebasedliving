Title: 'Unveiling the Truth: Is God Man-Made or Divine? Exploring the Origins of Faith'

## Is God Man-Made?

Some people argue that the concept of God is merely a human fabrication, a way for us to explain things that are difficult to understand. They claim that belief in God ignores science and embraces superstition. So, is the idea of God a fantasy based on ignorance and concocted by our forefathers before science proved it to be false?

**Here’s the truth: God is not man-made; rather, God made man.**

### The First Cause

Even skeptics agree that there is a beginning for every created thing, including man. So, in order for man to have a beginning, there must be a “first cause” that existed before him. Evolutionists argue that the first cause was an impersonal force, a “big bang,” that started the universe. But even that explanation leaves a lot of unanswered questions. What caused the Big Bang? What or who put those forces into motion? No reasonable answer, outside of the Bible, has been offered.

The Bible starts with the fact of God in [Genesis 1:1](https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/1/Genesis-1-1.html), “In the beginning God . . . .” When we set aside prejudice, the Bible’s answer seems to be the most logical explanation for that first cause. In the beginning was God. He was not created and therefore needs no first cause. He has always been and always will be, apart from time and space ([Psalm 90:2](https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/90/Psalm-90-2.html)). He introduced Himself to Moses as I AM ([Exodus 3:14](https://www.bibleref.com/Exodus/3/Exodus-3-14.html)). The meaning of His name signifies the eternal aspect of His nature. He always was and always will be the Eternal, Self-existent One ([Revelation 1:8](https://www.bibleref.com/Revelation/1/Revelation-1-8.html); 4:8).

### The Nature of God

Another consideration is the nature of God as revealed in the Bible. Many attributes of God are not those that human beings would necessarily think to include if they had invented Him. God’s character includes omniscience, omnipotence, patience, consistency, love, faithfulness, and a desire to have a relationship with us. But He is also perfectly just, and that justice requires payment for man’s high treason against his Creator. The God of the Bible took on human flesh, lived among us, and then allowed the people He created to torture Him to death while He forgave them. That kind of selfless, sacrificial love is outside human experience and not present in any man-made religion. Grace is a concept exclusive to the God of the Bible.

### Man-Made Gods

Man-made gods are usually fashioned in the image of man. The gods of pagan cultures are fraught with flaws, inconsistencies, and human-like weaknesses. They are petty, selfish, cruel, and capricious; in short, they behave as man-made gods would behave, with the same sins and jealousies found in the human heart. In order for God to be man-made, His nature could only extend as far as man’s imagination. The God of the Bible far surpasses our understanding, yet He leaves hints for us to follow as we come to know Him better.

### The Human Soul

Every human being is unique and possesses an innate sense of “me.” We have an inborn understanding of the eternal and the sense that there is more beyond this world. [Genesis 1:27](https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/1/Genesis-1-27.html) says that human beings were fashioned in the image of God; [Colossians 1:16](https://www.bibleref.com/Colossians/1/Colossians-1-16.html) says we were created for His purposes and His pleasure. We were created like Him in some ways but He is not necessarily like us. If God were merely a human fabrication, then many new questions arise: What makes human beings different from animals? Where do humans get the ideas of justice, benevolence, self-sacrifice, and love—abstract qualities not found in the animal kingdom? Such traits, found in every culture in the world, would never have survived the evolutionary process. However, when we see those traits showcased within the character of God Himself, we understand why we possess them.

### The Trustworthiness of the Bible

In order to contend that God does not exist, one must deal with the accuracy of the Book that tells about Him. The Bible is a collection of books written by over 40 different authors, over a 1,500-year time span, from three continents and in three different languages. Yet it weaves together the pieces of a single story like a jigsaw puzzle. The Bible is God’s story of His relentless pursuit to redeem His fallen creation.

Those who believe that the idea of God is man-made must also consider the manner in which the Bible portrays mankind, especially the Jews. If the Jews wrote the Bible to honor themselves, they failed miserably. Even the Lord Himself is clear that He chose the Israelites for His own reasons, not because they were deserving of special treatment. The failures of the Israelite nation are showcased again and again, right up to the crucifixion of the Son of God. Humanity is portrayed realistically, complete with sin, rebellion, and punishment. No group or individual is exalted. This raises the obvious question: if man fabricated the idea of God, what was his motive? Throughout history, those proclaiming the Bible’s truths have been martyred, stoned, and driven into hiding.

### The Complexity and Design of the Universe

If the idea of God is man-made, then there is no God, really, and the biggest question left unanswered relates to the complexity and apparent design of the universe. A single strand of DNA shows such intricate brilliance that random chance cannot come close to explaining it. Beyond that, billions of perfectly synchronized atoms, molecules, systems, and universes shout to us about a Designer. Removing God from the realm of possible explanations gives rise to many unanswerable questions. No other explanation makes sense. Theories abound, but none can claim definitive scientific evidence for the startling harmonization of the universe’s complexity.

### Why This Matters

Understanding that God is not man-made but rather the Creator of all things has profound implications for our lives and worldview. It means that we are not here by accident, but by design. We have purpose and value because we were intentionally created by a loving and just God. Our existence and the complexity of the universe point to a divine intelligence behind it all. Recognizing this truth helps us find meaning, purpose, and hope in a world that often seems chaotic and confusing.

### Think About It

It's important to critically examine the claims that God is man-made and evaluate the evidence presented. Consider the logical arguments for the existence of God and the nature of humanity. Reflect on your own experiences and understanding of justice, love, and morality. Explore the trustworthiness of the Bible and its portrayal of mankind and God. Contemplate the complexity and design of the universe. Engage in open-minded exploration of these topics, seeking truth wherever it may lead.

Remember, faith in God is not blind belief; it is based on reason, evidence, and personal experience. By seeking to understand more about God's existence and His role in our lives, we can deepen our relationship with Him and find greater purpose and fulfillment.

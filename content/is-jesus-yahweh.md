## Is Jesus Yahweh

The question of whether Jesus is Yahweh is a complex theological topic that requires an understanding of the biblical texts and the teachings of Christianity. The Bible refers to God as Yahweh in [Exodus 3:13-14](https://www.bibleref.com/Exodus/3/Exodus-3-13.html), where He states, "I AM WHO I AM." This phrase, translated from the Hebrew as YHWH, is often rendered as "LORD," "Yahweh," or "Jehovah" in English translations. It signifies God's self-existence and His independence from anything else for His existence.

One of the foundational doctrines of Christianity is that Jesus is God. However, this teaching can be challenging to comprehend because the Bible also emphasizes that there is only one God. [Deuteronomy 6:4](https://www.bibleref.com/Deuteronomy/6/Deuteronomy-6-4.html) states, "Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is one." This belief in the oneness of God is known as monotheism. 

Christianity teaches that there is one God who exists in a triune nature as three Persons within one God, a plurality of Persons who are one in essence. This doctrine is known as the Trinity. While fully acknowledging the complexity and mystery surrounding this concept, Christians affirm that Jesus, as part of the Trinity, is indeed Yahweh.

Throughout both the Old and New Testaments, there are verses that affirm Jesus' divine nature. In Psalm 2, for example, it speaks of the kings of the earth opposing both Yahweh and His Anointed (Messiah), referring to Jesus. It encourages people to submit to the Son to avoid His wrath and find refuge in Him. In numerous parables and teachings, Jesus uses titles and descriptions that align with those attributed to Yahweh in the Old Testament.

For instance, Jesus refers to Himself as "I AM" ([Exodus 3:14](https://www.bibleref.com/Exodus/3/Exodus-3-14.html)) and claims to be the Shepherd ([Psalm 23:1](https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/23/Psalm-23-1.html)), the Light ([Psalm 27:1](https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/27/Psalm-27-1.html)), the Rock ([Psalm 18:2](https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/18/Psalm-18-2.html)), the Ruler of all ([Isaiah 9:6](https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/9/Isaiah-9-6.html)), the Judge of all nations ([Joel 3:12](https://www.bibleref.com/Joel/3/Joel-3-12.html)), the Bridegroom ([Isaiah 62:5](https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/62/Isaiah-62-5.html); [Hosea 2:16](https://www.bibleref.com/Hosea/2/Hosea-2-16.html)), and the eternal Word of God ([Isaiah 40:8](https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/40/Isaiah-40-8.html)). In the New Testament, Jesus reiterates these claims and equates Himself with Yahweh, saying, "Anyone who has seen Me has seen the Father" ([John 14:9](https://www.bibleref.com/John/14/John-14-9.html)) and "I and the Father are one" ([John 10:30](https://www.bibleref.com/John/10/John-10-30.html)).

Jesus also accepts worship nine times in the gospels, forgives sins, commands His disciples to pray in His name, and is referred to as God by the New Testament writers in multiple passages. These references include [Matthew 3:16-17](https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/3/Matthew-3-16.html), [John 1:1-3](https://www.bibleref.com/John/1/John-1-1.html),14, [John 20:28](https://www.bibleref.com/John/20/John-20-28.html), [Romans 9:5](https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/9/Romans-9-5.html), [Philippians 2:5-8](https://www.bibleref.com/Philippians/2/Philippians-2-5.html),9-11, [Colossians 1:16-19](https://www.bibleref.com/Colossians/1/Colossians-1-16.html), 2:9-10, [Hebrews 1:8](https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/1/Hebrews-1-8.html),13:8, [Revelation 1:8](https://www.bibleref.com/Revelation/1/Revelation-1-8.html),17, 2:8,17:14,19:16,21:6,and 22:13.

In conclusion, according to Christian theology and the teachings of Scripture, Jesus is indeed Yahweh - the I AM, the God of the Old Testament. While comprehending the concept of the Trinity may be challenging due to its mysterious nature, it is essential to recognize that Christianity affirms one God who exists in three Persons within one divine essence.

## Jesus in Every Book of the Bible

The Bible is God's Word to us, revealing who God is, what He has done, and how we are to live. In this article, we will explore how Jesus is present in every book of the Bible. Jesus is the theme of the Bible, and everything in it ultimately points to Him.

### Jesus in the Old Testament

Although Jesus did not come to earth until a specific point in history, He is integral in both the Old and New Testaments. In the Old Testament, we see our need for a Savior and the predictions of His coming, which sets the stage for His entrance into the world.

In Genesis, Jesus is seen as the Word of God, through whom all things were created. He is also referred to as the promised Seed of the woman, pointing to His future coming as a human being ([Genesis 3:15](https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/3/Genesis-3-15.html)).

In Deuteronomy, Jesus is described as a prophet greater than Moses. Moses himself prophesied that God would raise up a prophet like him ([Deuteronomy 18:15](https://www.bibleref.com/Deuteronomy/18/Deuteronomy-18-15.html)), and Jesus perfectly fulfills this prophecy.

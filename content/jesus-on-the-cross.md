## Jesus on the Cross

The crucifixion of Jesus is a significant event in Christian theology and is described in the Gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. Jesus was crucified as a means of execution by the ancient Roman Empire for those found guilty of capital offenses. It was a method reserved for slaves, foreigners, insurrectionists, and individuals guilty of heinous crimes. In the case of Jesus, the Jewish leaders accused Him of inciting rebellion and claiming to be the King of Israel.

### Crucifixion as a Method of Execution

Crucifixion was not only intended to bring about death but also to serve as a deterrent for others. The victims of crucifixion were subjected to humiliation and often left completely naked. In Jewish Law, crucifixion was considered a curse. The term "excruciating" literally means "out of crucifying," highlighting the excruciating pain and slow death associated with this form of execution. Depending on the circumstances, individuals could suffer for days after being nailed to a cross.

### The Time Jesus Spent on the Cross

Determining the exact duration of Jesus' time on the cross can be somewhat complex due to the different systems of marking time used in the Gospels. Matthew, Mark, and Luke use the Jewish system, whereas John uses the Roman system. However, by examining these accounts together, we can approximate the duration of Jesus' crucifixion.

According to Mark's Gospel, Jesus was crucified at 9:00 A.M., which is referred to as the third hour using the Jewish system of marking time ([Mark 15:24](https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/15/Mark-15-24.html)â€“25). Matthew adds that darkness covered the land from noon until 3:00 P.M., known as the sixth hour to the Jewish system ([Matthew 27:45](https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/27/Matthew-27-45.html)). At around 3:00 P.M., Jesus cried out loudly and gave up His spirit, indicating His death ([Matthew 27:50](https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/27/Matthew-27-50.html)).

Additionally, John mentions that Jesus' trial before Pontius Pilate was taking place at about the sixth hour according to the Roman system of marking time ([John 19:14](https://www.bibleref.com/John/19/John-19-14.html)). As the Romans counted their hours from midnight, the "sixth hour" would correspond to 6:00 A.M. Therefore, Jesus' trial ended around 6:00 A.M., and His crucifixion began approximately three hours later.

Combining these details, we can conclude that Jesus was on the cross for approximately six hours, from 9:00 A.M. until 3:00 P.M.

### Why This Matters

Understanding the duration of Jesus' time on the cross is significant because it highlights the immense suffering He endured for the salvation of humanity. His crucifixion was not only a physical torment but also a spiritual sacrifice. By willingly offering Himself as a sacrifice, Jesus demonstrated His love for humanity and fulfilled the prophecies concerning the Messiah's death.

The crucifixion is central to Christian theology as it represents Jesus' redemptive work on the cross. It is through His sacrificial death that believers find forgiveness for their sins and receive salvation. Recognizing the extent of Jesus' suffering deepens our understanding of His love and sacrifice, inspiring gratitude and devotion.

1. **Sacrificial Love:** Contemplate the depth of Jesus' love for humanity, as He willingly endured such excruciating pain and humiliation on the cross.
2. **Salvation:** Ponder the significance of Jesus' sacrifice in providing salvation for all who believe in Him. How does this impact your faith journey?

## Reverence for God

Reverence for God is the deep honor and respect that is both felt within the heart and demonstrated outwardly. It is the response we have towards the awesome power and majesty of the Lord God Almighty. Reverence is not just a feeling, but it also involves our actions and attitudes towards God.

### The Old Testament Perspective

In the Old Testament, God taught the Israelites how to show proper reverence through the giving of laws related to purity, holiness, and worship. This was necessary because sinful humanity does not naturally know how to worship a holy God with reverence and awe. God's presence dwelt with Israel in the Ark of the Covenant, and they were instructed not to touch it as an act of reverence. The Holy of Holies inside the tabernacle also required the highest level of reverence. Disobeying God's command about entering the Holy of Holies resulted in instant death. These strict rules were intended to define holiness and impress upon mankind the necessity for reverence in the presence of the Lord.

### The New Testament Perspective

In New Testament Christianity, reverence for God is demonstrated by our willingness to die to self and obey His commands. Jesus taught His disciples to begin their prayers with "Our Father, who is in heaven, hallowed be your name." This reminds us to treat the name of God with reverence and not use it casually or irreverently. Reverence for God is also displayed through living a life that takes seriously His hatred of sin and understanding the coming judgment for those who refuse to repent. Pursuing holiness because He is holy is another way we demonstrate reverence for God.

### True Worship

True worship is a demonstration of reverence for God. Jesus taught that true worship involves both spirit and truth. Worshipping in spirit means that our hearts are abandoned before the Lord, willing to obey everything He has said. Worshipping in truth means that our minds are engaged and filled with a biblical understanding of God's nature. True worship is not limited to an emotional experience or confined to a specific song. It is a lifestyle of knowing God and serving Him. To worship God the way He deserves, we must align our hearts with His and seek to obey Him.

### The Modern Perspective

Reverence for God is often missing in modern Christianity. There is a tendency to have a casual, "Jesus-is-my-buddy" attitude that downplays the holiness, power, and righteous wrath of God. It is important to remember that reverence does not refer to God as "The Big Guy in the Sky" or "The Man Upstairs." Instead, true reverence recognizes who God truly is and honors Him accordingly. Even the thief on the cross, after realizing who Jesus was, rebuked the other thief for his irreverence and acknowledged Jesus as the King.

### Why This Matters

Reverence for God matters because it acknowledges the greatness and holiness of our Creator. It reminds us that we are not to take God lightly or treat Him casually. Reverence calls us to live lives that are set apart, pursuing holiness and obedience to His commands. It also helps us understand the seriousness of sin and the need for repentance.

### Think About It

1. How can you demonstrate reverence for God in your daily life?
2. Are there any areas in your life where you have been treating God casually or irreverently? How can you change that?
3. Why is it important to have a proper understanding of God's holiness and power when approaching Him in worship?
4. Reflect on how knowing God more deeply can lead to a greater reverence for Him.
5. Consider the words you use when talking about God. Do they reflect reverence and honor?

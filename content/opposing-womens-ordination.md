## Opposing Women's Ordination: A [Conservative Christian Perspective](/resisting-lgbtq-education)
In recent years, the issue of women's ordination has been a topic of great debate within Christian circles. Some argue that women should be allowed to hold positions of leadership and authority within the church, including pastoral roles, while others maintain a more traditional view that restricts such roles to men. As conservative Christians, it is important for us to examine this issue from a biblical perspective and uphold the values and teachings found in Scripture.

In this article, we will address [eight key questions](/resisting-secular-influence) regarding women's ordination, providing thorough answers grounded in conservative biblical interpretation. We will explore [the biblical foundation](/preserving-traditional-marriage) for these positions, engage with relevant 
### 1. What does the Bible teach about male-only leadership roles in the church?

The Bible clearly teaches that God has ordained male leadership roles within the church. In [1 Timothy 2:12-13](https://www.bibleref.com/1-Timothy/2/1-Timothy-2-12.html), the apostle Paul states, "I do not permit a woman to teach or to assume authority over a man; she must be quiet. For Adam was formed first, then Eve." This passage highlights the order of creation as a basis for male leadership and authority.

Similarly, in [1 Corinthians 14:34-35](https://www.bibleref.com/1-Corinthians/14/1-Corinthians-14-34.html), Paul instructs, "Women should remain silent in the churches. They are not allowed to speak but must be in submission, as the law says. If they want to inquire about something, they should ask their own husbands at home; for it is disgraceful for a woman to speak in the church." These verses affirm the importance of male leadership and submission within the context of worship gatherings.


### 2. Does culture play a role in determining the eligibility of women for ordination?

While culture may influence societal norms and practices, it should not dictate our understanding of biblical principles. The teachings of Scripture are timeless and transcendent, and they provide the ultimate authority on matters of faith and practice. The Bible's teachings on male leadership roles within the church are not contingent on cultural preferences or societal norms.

Even if some cultures or societies embrace gender equality in all spheres, conservative Christians believe that [the biblical mandate](/mens-ministry) for male leadership in the church remains unchanged. Our interpretation of Scripture should not be swayed by cultural shifts but grounded in the unchanging truth of God's Word.

### 3. How do traditional Christian doctrines inform our understanding of women's ordination?

Traditional Christian doctrines, such as the doctrine of biblical inerrancy and the doctrine of creation, play a crucial role in shaping our understanding of women's ordination. The belief in the divine inspiration and infallibility of Scripture means that we view the Bible as the authoritative guide for faith and practice.

Furthermore, the doctrine of creation affirms the complementarity of male and female roles. God created man and woman with distinct purposes and responsibilities, which extend to their roles within the church. [Traditional Christian doctrines](/limiting-islamic-visibility) provide a solid foundation for upholding male-only leadership roles while respecting and valuing the unique contributions women make within other areas of ministry.

### 4. Is there room for women to exercise their gifts and talents within the church?

Absolutely. While women may not hold pastoral or teaching roles that involve authority over men, they can still exercise their gifts and talents in various other areas of ministry. The Bible presents a rich tapestry of roles for women within the church, including serving as deacons, leading women's ministries, participating in evangelism and mission work, and contributing to the spiritual growth and development of the body of Christ.

The South American Division of the Seventh-day Adventist Church recognizes the importance of women's contributions by allowing them to serve as elders. This role provides an opportunity for women to exercise their spiritual gifts, offer pastoral care, and contribute to the overall ministry of the church while adhering to conservative biblical principles regarding leadership roles.


### 5. How can we navigate the tension between equality and complementarity?

Conservative Christians understand that equality and complementarity are not mutually exclusive concepts. While men and women are equal in value and dignity before God, they have been created with distinct roles and responsibilities. Embracing this complementarity allows us to honor both male and female contributions within the church while maintaining a biblical understanding of leadership roles.

Rather than seeking to erase gender distinctions or promote a genderless society, we should celebrate the unique qualities and gifts that God has bestowed upon men and women. By recognizing and affirming these differences, we can foster an environment where both genders can thrive in their respective roles without compromising biblical principles.

### 6. How do we respond to those who advocate for women's ordination based on cultural shifts or societal pressure?

While it is important to engage in respectful dialogue with those who hold differing views, our response must be grounded in biblical truth rather than cultural shifts or societal pressure. We should lovingly present our conservative biblical interpretation and provide sound theological arguments that uphold male-only leadership roles within the church.

It is essential to emphasize the authority of Scripture as our ultimate guide and to highlight the unchanging nature of biblical teachings. Our response should be characterized by humility, grace, and a genuine desire for unity within the body of Christ, even as we hold firm to our convictions.

### 7. How can we encourage women to embrace their unique roles and contributions within the church?

As conservative Christians, we have a responsibility to create an environment where women feel valued, affirmed, and empowered to use their gifts and talents in service to God and the church. We should actively seek out opportunities for women to exercise their spiritual gifts and provide avenues for their involvement in various ministries.

Mentoring programs, leadership training, and intentional support networks can help women develop and grow in their faith while utilizing their unique abilities. By fostering a culture that celebrates and affirms women's contributions, we can create a vibrant and inclusive community where all members feel valued and supported.

### 8. How can we navigate church divisions on this issue while maintaining unity?

Navigating church divisions on the issue of women's ordination requires a commitment to biblical truth, humility, and love for one another. It is crucial to engage in respectful dialogue, seeking common ground while acknowledging areas of disagreement.

While unity is important, it should not come at the expense of compromising biblical principles. It may be necessary for churches or denominations to make difficult decisions that align with their understanding of Scripture. However, throughout this process, we should strive to maintain an attitude of love and respect toward those with differing views.

Ultimately, our focus should be on glorifying God, upholding conservative biblical interpretations, and promoting the unity of the body of Christ in all aspects of our faith and practice.
Opposing women's ordination from a conservative Christian perspective requires a faithful commitment to upholding the teachings of Scripture and traditional Christian doctrines. While recognizing and affirming women's unique contributions and gifts, we must maintain a steadfast belief in the biblical mandate for male leadership within the church.

By engaging in respectful dialogue, emphasizing biblical truth, and fostering an environment that values and supports women's contributions, we can navigate this issue with grace and love. May our commitment to conservative biblical interpretation guide our understanding of women's roles in the church and lead us to a deeper unity within the body of Christ.

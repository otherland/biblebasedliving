## Yeshua Jesus

In the discussion surrounding the name of our Lord, some individuals argue that He should only be referred to as "Yeshua" and that using the name "Jesus" is blasphemous. They claim that the name "Jesus" is unbiblical because it originated from a modern invention, the letter "J," which did not exist in Greek or Hebrew. However, it is important to note that "Yeshua" is the Hebrew name for our Lord, and its English equivalent is "Joshua," while "Jesus" is the Greek transliteration of the Hebrew name. Both names, "Joshua" and "Jesus," essentially refer to the same person.

Changing the language of a word does not alter its meaning. For instance, we call a bound and covered set of pages a "book." In German, it becomes a "Buch," in Spanish it is a "libro," and in French, it is a "livre." The language may change, but the object remains the same. Similarly, we can refer to Jesus as "Jesus," "Yeshua," or even "耶稣" (Yēsū in Cantonese) without changing His nature. In any language, His name signifies "The Lord Is Salvation."

Regarding the controversy over the letter "J," it is essentially inconsequential. It is true that the languages in which the Bible was written did not have a letter equivalent to "J." However, this does not mean that we cannot use the spelling "Jesus" when speaking or writing in English. Different languages have their own spellings for words. For example, Americans write "Savior," while the British write "Saviour." The presence or absence of a particular letter does not alter whom we are referring to. Jesus is still the Savior, regardless of how we spell His name.

The Bible does not command us to exclusively speak or write His name in Hebrew or Greek. It never even suggests such an idea. On the Day of Pentecost, when the message of the gospel was proclaimed, the apostles spoke in various languages to ensure that people from different language groups could understand. The Holy Spirit enabled Jesus to be known in a way that transcended language barriers. Therefore, spelling or language does not hold significance.

We refer to Him as "Jesus" because, as English-speaking individuals, we have come to know Him through English translations of the Greek New Testament. Scripture does not prioritize any specific language over another, nor does it indicate that we must use Hebrew when addressing the Lord. The command is simply to "call on the name of the Lord," with the promise that we "shall be saved." Whether we call on Him in English, Korean, Hindi, or Hebrew, the result remains the same: the Lord is salvation.

### Why This Matters

Understanding the significance of Jesus' name can help us appreciate His role as our Savior and recognize that His salvation is available to all people, regardless of their native language. It emphasizes the universality of His message and highlights the power of the Holy Spirit to bridge linguistic gaps. By focusing on His redemptive work rather than getting caught up in debates about names and spellings, we can maintain unity and direct our efforts towards proclaiming His gospel to all nations.

### Think About It

1. How does knowing that Jesus' name means "The Lord Is Salvation" influence your understanding of His purpose and mission?
2. Do you think it is important to pronounce Jesus' name exactly as it would have been in Hebrew or Greek? Why or why not?
3. Reflect on [Acts 2:21](https://www.bibleref.com/Acts/2/Acts-2-21.html) and [Joel 2:32](https://www.bibleref.com/Joel/2/Joel-2-32.html). What do these verses teach us about calling on the name of the Lord for salvation?

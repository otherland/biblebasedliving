## Does God Pursue Us

The pursuit of God is a central theme throughout the Bible. While human beings are commanded to pursue God and promised that they will find Him when they do, it is also clear that God is the initiator of these spiritual pursuits. Jesus said that no one can come to Him unless the Father first draws them ([John 6:44](https://www.bibleref.com/John/6/John-6-44.html)). This concept can be understood through several parables that Jesus shared to illustrate God's pursuit of mankind.

### The Initiation of God's Pursuit

From the very beginning, God has pursued us. After Adam and Eve sinned, they did not run towards God but instead hid among the trees of the garden. However, God did not give up on them. He called out to them, asking "Where are you?" ([Genesis 3:9](https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/3/Genesis-3-9.html)). This act of seeking them out exemplifies God's heart of reconciliation and His desire to have a relationship with His creation.

### Parables Illustrating God's Pursuit

Jesus used parables such as the lost sheep and the lost coin to teach about God's pursuit of us. In these parables, Jesus emphasized that God knows each person intimately and values them greatly. He highlighted the importance of every individual by comparing them to a lost sheep or a lost coin. Just as a shepherd would leave his flock to search for one lost sheep, God actively pursues each one of us.

### The Ultimate Act of Pursuit

God's pursuit of us culminated in the sending of His beloved Son, Jesus Christ, to die in our place ([John 3:16](https://www.bibleref.com/John/3/John-3-16.html)–18; [2 Corinthians 5:21](https://www.bibleref.com/2-Corinthians/5/2-Corinthians-5-21.html); 9:15). We were unable to reach God through our own efforts, so He reached down to us. This act of sacrifice demonstrates the extent to which God is willing to pursue us and reconcile us to Himself.

### God's Pursuit Despite Our Obstinacy

Even when we are obstinate and resistant, God continues to pursue us. In the book of Isaiah, the Lord reveals that He revealed Himself to those who did not ask for Him and was found by those who did not seek Him. He held out His hands to an obstinate people who continually provoked Him ([Isaiah 65:1](https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/65/Isaiah-65-1.html)–3). This demonstrates God's persistent pursuit of humanity, even when we turn away from Him.

### Jesus' Pursuit of His Creation

Jesus walked among the people He loved and lamented their spiritual stubbornness. He expressed His longing to gather the people of Jerusalem together, but they were unwilling ([Matthew 23:37](https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/23/Matthew-23-37.html)). Jesus came in the flesh to pursue those He had created, but many rejected Him ([John 1:11](https://www.bibleref.com/John/1/John-1-11.html)–13). However, God's message of redemption has gone out to the whole world, and salvation is available to all who believe ([John 3:16](https://www.bibleref.com/John/3/John-3-16.html); 12:46; [Romans 1:16](https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/1/Romans-1-16.html)).

### The Continuation of God's Pursuit

Through His followers, Jesus has continued to pursue men and women from every era, nation, tribe, and tongue. The disciples were instructed to be witnesses to the ends of the earth ([Acts 1:8](https://www.bibleref.com/Acts/1/Acts-1-8.html)), and since then, believers have spread the good news that God is pursuing a relationship with them. The pursuit of God extends to believers today through the indwelling Holy Spirit. Through the Holy Spirit, God comforts, corrects, and compels His children to obey His Word. He disciplines us as part of His work in conforming us to the image of His Son ([Romans 8:29](https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/8/Romans-8-29.html); [Hebrews 12:5](https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/12/Hebrews-12-5.html)–7).

### Why This Matters

Understanding that God pursues us is essential because it reveals His love and desire for a relationship with us. It reminds us that our salvation is not based on our own efforts but on God's grace. Recognizing God's pursuit can also motivate us to respond to His love by seeking a deeper relationship with Him.

### Think About It

Consider the significance of God pursuing us even when we are obstinate or resistant. How does this revelation of God's character impact your view of Him? How can you respond to God's pursuit in your own life?

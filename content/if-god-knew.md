## Did God Know Satan Would Rebel?

The question of whether God knew that Satan would rebel is an important one. According to the Bible, God is described as being omniscient, meaning that He is all-knowing. This concept is supported by various passages in Scripture such as [Job 37:16](https://www.bibleref.com/Job/37/Job-37-16.html), [Psalm 139:2](https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/139/Psalm-139-2.html)–4 and 147:5, [Proverbs 5:21](https://www.bibleref.com/Proverbs/5/Proverbs-5-21.html), [Isaiah 46:9-10](https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/46/Isaiah-46-9.html), and [1 John 3:19](https://www.bibleref.com/1-John/3/1-John-3-19.html)–20. These verses leave no doubt that God's knowledge is infinite, and He knows everything that has happened in the past, is happening now, and will happen in the future.

When we look at some of the superlatives used in these verses such as "perfect in knowledge," "his understanding has no limit," and "he knows everything," it becomes clear that God's knowledge is not just greater than our own, but infinitely greater. He knows all things completely. If God's knowledge were not perfect, there would be a deficiency in His nature. However, any deficiency in God's nature would mean that He cannot be God because His essence requires the perfection of all His attributes. Therefore, the answer to the first question is "yes, God knew that Satan would rebel."

## Why Did God Create Satan Knowing He Would Rebel?

The second part of the question, "Why did God create Satan knowing ahead of time he was going to rebel?" is a bit trickier because the Bible does not always provide comprehensive answers to "why" questions. However, we can still gain some limited understanding.

To begin with, it is important to note that saying "Satan would rebel" is not the same as saying "Satan rebelled." The angel Lucifer had free will and made his own choices. God did not create Lucifer as the devil; He created him good ([Genesis 1:31](https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/1/Genesis-1-31.html)).

In trying to understand why God created Satan, knowing he would rebel, we should consider a few important facts:

### Lucifer's Original Purpose

Lucifer had a good and perfect purpose before his fall. His rebellion does not change God's original intent from something good to something bad.

### God's Sovereignty

God's sovereignty extends to Satan, even in his fallen condition. This means that God is able to use Satan's evil actions to ultimately bring about God's holy plan.

### God's Plan of Salvation

God's plan of salvation was ordained from eternity past. Salvation requires something to be saved from, so God allowed Satan's rebellion and the spread of sin.

### The Role of Suffering

The suffering that Satan brought into the world actually became the means by which Jesus, in His humanity, was made the complete and perfect Savior of mankind. Through His suffering, Jesus brings many sons and daughters to glory.

### Destruction of Satan's Work

From the very beginning, God's plan in Christ included the destruction of Satan's work. This is mentioned in [1 John 3:8](https://www.bibleref.com/1-John/3/1-John-3-8.html).

Ultimately, we cannot fully understand why God created Satan, knowing he would rebel. It may be tempting to assume that things would be "better" if Satan had never been created or to declare that God should have done things differently. However, such assumptions and declarations are unwise. In fact, claiming that we know better than God how to run the universe is falling into the same sin as the devil himself when he tried to exalt himself above the Most High ([Isaiah 14:13](https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/14/Isaiah-14-13.html)–14).

## Why This Matters

Understanding why God created Satan, knowing he would rebel, is significant for several reasons. Firstly, it highlights the sovereignty and omniscience of God. It reminds us that He is in control of all things, even the actions of rebellious beings. Secondly, it emphasizes the importance of free will. Lucifer had the ability to make his own choices, and his rebellion serves as a reminder that even creatures created good can choose to reject God. Finally, it points to the ultimate victory of Christ over Satan and sin. God's plan of redemption and salvation is not thwarted by rebellion, but rather accomplished through it.

## Think About It

Reflecting on the fact that God knew Satan would rebel, yet still created him, raises several thought-provoking questions. It challenges us to consider our own understanding of God's sovereignty and His purposes in allowing evil to exist. It also invites us to reflect on our own choices and the consequences they have in light of God's omniscience. Ultimately, it should lead us to a place of humility and trust in God's perfect wisdom and plan for our lives.

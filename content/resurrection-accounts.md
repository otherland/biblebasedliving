## Resurrection Accounts

The events surrounding Jesus' resurrection can be challenging to understand due to the various accounts found in the Gospels. It is important to remember that the writers of the Gospels did not attempt to provide an exhaustive narrative of the resurrection events. Instead, they focused on conveying the central truths - that Jesus was resurrected from the dead and that He appeared to many people.

### The Excitement and Chaos

After Jesus' resurrection, Jerusalem was filled with excitement and chaos. Many people were going in different directions, groups were separated, and several different groups paid visits to the tomb, possibly more than once. This context helps explain why there are variations in the details of the resurrection accounts.

### Consistency in Eyewitness Testimonies

While there may be apparent inconsistencies in some details, it is important to recognize that the resurrection accounts from the four Gospels are consistent in their central message. The writers provide eyewitness testimonies of Jesus' resurrection and His appearances to many individuals.

The apparent inconsistencies are often related to "side issues" rather than essential elements of the resurrection accounts. For example, some differences may arise when considering how many angels were seen in the tomb or the exact sequence of appearances. However, these variations do not undermine the trustworthiness of the accounts.

### A Possible Harmony of Events

To better understand the sequence of events leading up to and following Jesus' resurrection, we can consider a possible harmony of the narratives found in Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John:

1. Jesus is buried as several women watch.
2. The tomb is sealed and guarded.
3. At least three women prepare spices to go to the tomb.
4. An angel descends from heaven, rolls away the stone, and sits on it.
5. The women arrive at the tomb and find it empty. Mary Magdalene leaves to inform the disciples.
6. The women still at the tomb see two angels who tell them about Jesus' resurrection.
7. The women leave to bring the news to the disciples.
8. Mary, the mother of James, and other women see Jesus on their way to find the disciples.
9. The women share what they have seen and heard with the disciples.
10. Peter and John run to the tomb, find it empty, and see the grave clothes.
11. Mary Magdalene returns to the tomb, sees the angels, and then sees Jesus.
12. Jesus appears to Peter later that same day.
13. Jesus appears to Cleopas and another disciple on their way to Emmaus.
14. The two disciples report the event to the Eleven in Jerusalem.
15. Jesus appears to ten disciples (Thomas is missing).
16. Jesus appears to all eleven disciples (including Thomas).
17. Jesus appears to seven disciples by the Sea of Galilee.
18. Jesus appears to about 500 disciples in Galilee.
19. Jesus appears to His half-brother James.
20. Jesus commissions His disciples.
21. Jesus teaches His disciples the Scriptures and promises to send the Holy Spirit.
22. Jesus ascends into heaven.

This possible harmony provides an overview of the key events following Jesus' resurrection.

### Why This Matters

Understanding the resurrection accounts is essential for Christians because they provide evidence for the central truth of Christianity: that Jesus was resurrected from the dead. The consistency in eyewitness testimonies helps reinforce this truth and strengthens our faith in Jesus as Lord and Savior.

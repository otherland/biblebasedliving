## Sickness and the Sovereignty of God

The concept of sickness and its relationship to the sovereignty of God is an important aspect of Christian theology. The Bible teaches that God is almighty and in complete control of all things, including sickness. However, it is crucial to understand that allowing something to happen and causing something to happen are two different things.

When we look at the origins of sickness, we can trace it back to the fall of humanity into sin. When Adam and Eve rebelled against God, they brought about all manner of evil, including sickness. Sickness is a manifestation of natural evil, which includes things like natural disasters and physical illnesses. It is a state where good health is missing, a corruption or perversion of the originally good and healthy state of being.

While God did not directly cause Adam and Eve to sin, He allowed their rebellion for His own purposes and to bring about His perfect plan. Evil is not caused by God but allowed by Him to exist. The Greek word for evil, ponerous, implies a malignancy that corrupts a good and healthy state of being.

## The Consequences of Sin

The consequences of Adam's sin affected all of humanity, including the introduction of sickness into the world. In [Romans 8:20-22](https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/8/Romans-8-20.html), it states that creation was subjected to frustration following the fall, not by its own choice but by the will of God. This frustration includes sickness and decay. However, there is hope as creation longs for liberation from its bondage to sin and awaits the glorious freedom that comes through Christ.

It is important to note that until that day of liberation comes, God uses sickness and other forms of evil to fulfill His sovereign purposes, bring glory to Himself, and exalt His holy name. Sometimes, He miraculously heals sickness as we see in the ministry of Jesus who went through Israel healing various illnesses and even raising the dead. Other times, God uses sickness as a form of discipline or judgment against sin, as demonstrated in the cases of King Uzziah and Nebuchadnezzar.

## The Role of Sickness in God's Plan

While sickness can be a consequence of our fallen world, our bodies, and poor health choices, it is important to remember that all sickness and disease are allowed by God for His purposes. We may not always understand these purposes, but God is in control. He determines the boundaries of evil, just as He did with Satan in the book of Job.

In 3 John 2, we see an indication that God desires His people to be in good health. However, even believers may experience sickness and suffering in this life. It is through their suffering that they can glorify God, even if they do not fully understand why He has allowed it. In eternity, when we stand in His presence, all questions will be answered or perhaps become irrelevant as we bask in His glory.

## Why This Matters

Understanding the relationship between sickness and the sovereignty of God is essential for our faith. It helps us navigate the challenges of life and suffering. Knowing that God is in control and has a plan even in the midst of sickness gives us hope and comfort. It also reminds us that our ultimate healing comes through Christ and the liberation from sin that He offers.

## Think About It

1. How does understanding the sovereignty of God impact your perspective on sickness and suffering?
2. How can we find comfort and hope in knowing that God is in control even in the midst of sickness?
3. Reflect on instances where you have seen God work through sickness or suffering to bring about His purposes.
4. How does the concept of God allowing sickness challenge our understanding of His goodness?

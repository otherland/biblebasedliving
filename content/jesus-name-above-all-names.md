Title: 'Exalting Jesus: The Supreme Name Above All Names'

## Jesus: The Name Above All Names

The Bible tells us that the name of Jesus is above every other name. In [Philippians 2:9-11](https://www.bibleref.com/Philippians/2/Philippians-2-9.html), the apostle Paul declares, “Therefore God exalted him to the highest place and gave him the name that is above every name, that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, in heaven and on earth and under the earth, and every tongue acknowledge that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.” This passage highlights the exalted status of Jesus and the authority that comes with His name. Let's explore what this means and why it matters for Christians.

### Jesus' Humility and Exaltation

In this passage, Paul emphasizes the importance of humility by presenting Jesus as the ultimate example. He explains that Jesus, who is fully God, willingly emptied Himself of His divine privileges and took on the form of a humble servant. Despite being equal with God, Jesus chose to live a life of obedience and service, ultimately sacrificing Himself on the cross for the salvation of humanity.

Through His self-emptying and obedience, Jesus demonstrated unparalleled humility. As a result, God exalted Him to the highest place of honor. Jesus, who stooped down low, was raised by the Father to His glorious position in heaven. This exaltation includes receiving a name above all names, a name that acknowledges Jesus Christ's absolute lordship as divine King of the universe.

### The Supreme Authority of Jesus

The name that is above every other name signifies Jesus' supreme authority over all creation. It is a divine name that carries immense weight and demands worship. In [Philippians 2:10](https://www.bibleref.com/Philippians/2/Philippians-2-10.html), Paul states that every knee will bow at the name of Jesus—in heaven, on earth, and even under the earth. This means that every created being will acknowledge Jesus as Lord.

It is crucial to note that this universal acknowledgment of Jesus' authority does not imply universal salvation. Instead, it points to the time when every creature will recognize His sovereignty. Jesus, who sits at the right hand of God in the place of honor, is Lord over all. He is the one Lord, through whom all things were created and through whom we live.

This supreme authority of Jesus extends to both the living and the dead. He is the Lord upon whom the church calls, our Mediator, Intercessor, and Reconciler. Jesus is the One who grants us entrance into the Kingdom of Heaven. By acknowledging Jesus as Lord, we affirm His divinity and recognize His supreme authority over our lives.

### Why This Matters

Understanding that Jesus has been given the name above all names has significant implications for our faith and daily lives. Here are a few reasons why this truth matters:

1. **Worship**: Recognizing Jesus as Lord means acknowledging His divine authority and responding with heartfelt worship. We should bow our knees and submit ourselves to Him in reverence and adoration.

2. **Humility**: Jesus' example of humility challenges us to cultivate a humble attitude in our own lives. Just as He emptied Himself for the sake of others, we are called to set aside our selfish desires and serve one another with love.

3. **Obedience**: Jesus' obedience to the Father's will, even unto death, sets an example for us to follow. We should strive to obey God's commands and live a life that brings glory to Him.

4. **Salvation**: Recognizing Jesus as Lord is essential for salvation. It is through faith in Him that we receive forgiveness of sins and eternal life. By acknowledging His lordship, we enter into a personal relationship with Him and experience the transformation of our hearts.

5. **Hope**: The exalted status of Jesus gives us hope for the future. As believers, we can rest assured that He has conquered sin and death, and one day He will return to establish His kingdom fully. This hope encourages us to persevere through trials and challenges, knowing that our ultimate victory is in Him.

### Think About It

1. How does recognizing Jesus as the name above all names impact your understanding of His authority in your life?
2. In what ways can you emulate Jesus' humility in your relationships with others?
3. How does acknowledging Jesus as Lord influence your worship and obedience?
4. Reflect on the hope that comes from knowing Jesus has been exalted. How does this hope shape your perspective and actions?

Remember, the name of Jesus is not just a mere title but represents His supreme authority and divinity. As followers of Christ, let us continually honor and acknowledge Him as Lord, allowing His name to have its rightful place in our lives.

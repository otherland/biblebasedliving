## Mocking God: Understanding the Purpose of Free Will

### Introduction

Every day, all around the world, there are individuals who mock God. They go to great lengths to blaspheme, ridicule, and challenge their Creator. This audacious display of mockery can be disheartening and raises questions about why God allows it to continue. In order to understand this, we must delve into the concept of free will and its role in our relationship with God.

### 1. Free Will: A Gift from God

God created mankind with the precious gift of free will. As stated in [Revelation 4:11](https://www.bibleref.com/Revelation/4/Revelation-4-11.html), "Thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive glory and honor and power: for thou hast created all things, and for thy pleasure they are and were created" (KJV). In creating us with free will, God desired a genuine relationship with His children, rather than mindless servants. Just as human parents desire a loving relationship with their children, God wanted fellowship with us â€“ thinking individuals with our own quirks and personalities.

### Why This Matters

Understanding that free will is a gift from God helps us appreciate the depth of His love for us. It shows that He desires our voluntary love and worship, rather than mere obedience. This knowledge encourages us to make intentional choices that align with His will.

### 2. The Consequence of Free Will

With free will comes the ability to choose between good and evil, right and wrong. Unfortunately, this also means that individuals have the freedom to disobey, blaspheme, or even mock God. [Galatians 6:7](https://www.bibleref.com/Galatians/6/Galatians-6-7.html) warns us that God will not be mocked forever. While mockery may seem temporary, there will come a day of reckoning when individuals reap what they have sown.

### Why This Matters

Recognizing the consequences of our actions helps us understand the seriousness of mocking God. It challenges us to reflect on our choices and consider the impact they may have on our relationship with Him. It also reminds us that there is accountability for our actions, both in this life and in eternity.

### 3. The Solution: Restoring the Relationship

Despite our ability to mock God, He has provided a solution for our broken relationship with Him. Through the sacrifice of Jesus Christ on the cross, we have the means to restore a loving relationship with God. This act of ultimate love offers forgiveness and redemption to those who believe in Him.

Understanding the solution God has provided through Jesus Christ gives us hope and reassurance. It shows that despite our shortcomings and failures, we can experience restoration and forgiveness through faith. It reminds us of the depth of God's love and His desire for reconciliation with His creation.

### Think About It

Consider how your understanding of free will impacts your relationship with God. Does it encourage you to seek a genuine, voluntary relationship with Him? How does knowing that God will not be mocked forever affect your choices and actions?

### 4. The Purpose of Mockery: A Test of Faith

While mockery may appear disheartening, it serves as a test of faith. Just as trials refine our character, mockery challenges us to strengthen our belief in God even in the face of opposition. It reveals the depth of our commitment to Him and allows us to grow spiritually.

### Why This Matters

Recognizing the purpose behind mockery helps us navigate through challenging times. It encourages us to hold firm to our faith and trust in God's sovereignty, even when faced with ridicule. It reminds us that our response to mockery can serve as a testimony of our unwavering devotion to Him.

### 5. Responding to Mockery: Grace and Love

In the face of mockery, Christians are called to respond with grace and love. Jesus taught us to love our enemies and pray for those who persecute us ([Matthew 5:44](https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/5/Matthew-5-44.html)). By responding with kindness and compassion, we demonstrate the transformative power of God's love and His ability to change hearts.

### Why This Matters

Responding to mockery with grace and love sets us apart as followers of Christ. It reflects His character and can have a profound impact on those who witness our response. It presents an opportunity to showcase the love of God and potentially lead others to a relationship with Him.

### Think About It

Consider a time when you faced mockery or ridicule for your faith. How did you respond? Did your response reflect the love and grace of Christ? How could you grow in responding to mockery with kindness and compassion?

### 6. The Final Judgment: God's Justice Prevails

While it may seem that mockery goes unpunished, there will come a day when God's justice prevails. The Bible assures us that every individual will be held accountable for their actions, including their mockery of God. On that day, the true nature of every person's heart will be revealed, and God's justice will be fully realized.

### Why This Matters

The promise of God's ultimate justice provides comfort and reassurance. It reminds us that even in the face of apparent injustice, God sees all and will bring about justice in His perfect timing. It encourages us to trust in His sovereignty and find peace in knowing that He is in control.

### Conclusion

Mocking God is a reality that we must grapple with in a world where free will exists. However, understanding the purpose of free will helps us appreciate the depth of God's love for us and the desire for a genuine relationship with His children. While mockery may seem disheartening, we can find hope in the solution provided through Jesus Christ, which offers forgiveness and restoration. Responding to mockery with grace and love showcases the transformative power of God's love and sets us apart as followers of Christ. Ultimately, we can find reassurance in the promise of God's justice, knowing that He sees all and will bring about judgment in due time.

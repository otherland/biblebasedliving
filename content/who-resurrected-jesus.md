## Who Resurrected Jesus

The resurrection of Jesus is a foundational event in Christianity. It is important to understand who was involved in this miraculous event. According to the Bible, all three Persons of the Trinity played a role in the resurrection of Jesus.

### God Raised Jesus from the Dead

In [Acts 2:24](https://www.bibleref.com/Acts/2/Acts-2-24.html), Peter declares that "God raised [Jesus] from the dead." This statement provides the basic answer to the question of who resurrected Jesus. However, as we delve deeper into Scripture, it becomes evident that there is more to this answer.

### The Father, Son, and Holy Spirit

Scripture reveals that each Person of the Trinity was involved in the resurrection. [Galatians 1:1](https://www.bibleref.com/Galatians/1/Galatians-1-1.html) states that the Father raised Jesus from the dead. First Peter 3:18 indicates that the Spirit raised Jesus from the dead, and [Romans 1:4](https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/1/Romans-1-4.html) also supports this notion. Additionally, [Romans 8:11](https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/8/Romans-8-11.html) affirms that God will resurrect believers "through His Spirit." Furthermore, Jesus Himself predicted His own resurrection in [John 2:19](https://www.bibleref.com/John/2/John-2-19.html) and [John 10:18](https://www.bibleref.com/John/10/John-10-18.html).

So, when we consider who resurrected Jesus, we can say that it was God. By this, we mean that all three Persons of the Trinity were involved in this divine act. It may seem puzzling how Jesus could be said to raise Himself, but we must remember that He was not just a man who died; He was the eternal Son of God incarnate.

### The Authority of Jesus

While it may be difficult for us to comprehend, Jesus possessed divine authority over life and death. In [John 10:17](https://www.bibleref.com/John/10/John-10-17.html)–18, Jesus makes a unique statement that sets Him apart from any mortal being: "I lay down my life—only to take it up again. No one takes it from me, but I lay it down of my own accord. I have authority to lay it down and authority to take it up again."

Jesus' authority to both lay down His life and raise it up again stems from His divine nature. He is the eternal Son of God, and even though wicked men could kill His physical body, they could not diminish His divine power or change His eternal nature. Jesus claimed to be the resurrection Himself, declaring in [John 11:25](https://www.bibleref.com/John/11/John-11-25.html), "I am the resurrection and the life." He has absolute authority over life and death, as affirmed in [Revelation 1:18](https://www.bibleref.com/Revelation/1/Revelation-1-18.html).

### The Involvement of the Trinity

It is crucial to understand that all three Persons of the Trinity are involved in various aspects of creation, salvation, and the resurrection of Jesus. In [1 Corinthians 8:6](https://www.bibleref.com/1-Corinthians/8/1-Corinthians-8-6.html) and [Genesis 1:1](https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/1/Genesis-1-1.html)–2, we see that all three Persons participated in creation. Similarly, in [John 3:6](https://www.bibleref.com/John/3/John-3-6.html) and [John 3:16](https://www.bibleref.com/John/3/John-3-16.html), we find that all three are involved in salvation. Therefore, it should not come as a surprise that all three Persons are responsible for the resurrection of Christ Jesus.

### Why This Matters

Understanding who resurrected Jesus is essential because it reveals the divine nature of Jesus as the Son of God. It underscores His authority over life and death, reinforcing the Christian belief in His divinity. Recognizing that all three Persons of the Trinity were involved in the resurrection helps us grasp the depth of this miraculous event and highlights the unity and cooperation within the Godhead.

### Think About It

Reflecting on the resurrection of Jesus can deepen our appreciation for the power and authority of God. It prompts us to consider the significance of Jesus' claim to be the resurrection and the life. Contemplating how all three Persons of the Trinity worked together in this extraordinary event invites us to embrace a fuller understanding of God's triune nature. Ultimately, contemplating the resurrection can inspire gratitude and awe for God's redemptive plan and His victory over sin and death through Jesus Christ.

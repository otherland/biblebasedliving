## The Meaning of Yahweh

Yahweh is a name for God that is found in the Old Testament. It is based on the Hebrew consonants YHWH and is considered one of the sacred names for God. In ancient Hebrew, vowels were not normally written, so the pronunciation of Yahweh has been a subject of debate. Jehovah is another name for God that is based on the Latin equivalents of the Hebrew letters, JHVH. Both Jehovah and Yahweh are used to refer to God's name in different translations of the Bible.

The name Yahweh comes from the Hebrew word for "I am." In the book of Exodus, when God met Moses at the burning bush and commanded him to lead the people out of Egypt, Moses asked who he should say has sent him. God replied, "I am who I am" and instructed Moses to tell the people that "I am" has sent him. God also said, "The LORD [YHWH], the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, has sent me to you." This name represents God's self-existence and self-sufficiency. It signifies that God is not dependent on anyone or anything for His existence.

The ancient Hebrew scribes considered God's name too sacred to write or pronounce. When vowels were later added to the text, they took the vowels from the word Adonai, which means "lord" or "master," and inserted them between the consonants YHWH. Instead of pronouncing Yahweh, they pronounced it as Adonai. This practice continues today, and most English versions of the Bible translate YHWH as "LORD" in all capital letters. The pronunciation yäˌwā is an approximation based on our best estimate of how YHWH would have been pronounced.

Yahweh is the covenant name for the God of Israel. In [Exodus 6:3](https://www.bibleref.com/Exodus/6/Exodus-6-3.html), God says, "I appeared to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, as God Almighty, but by my name the LORD I did not make myself known to them." This statement may seem contradictory because both Noah (in [Genesis 9:26](https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/9/Genesis-9-26.html)) and Abraham (in [Genesis 22:14](https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/22/Genesis-22-14.html)) spoke of Yahweh by that name. Moses himself suggests that the Hebrews were already familiar with the name Yahweh in [Exodus 4:1](https://www.bibleref.com/Exodus/4/Exodus-4-1.html). The explanation is that while the patriarchs knew the name Yahweh, they did not experience its full impact. They knew God as "Almighty," but they had yet to witness the fulfillment of His promises and understand the depth of His character.

Yahweh is not only the name of Israel's God but also the God who came to earth as Jesus Christ. In [Matthew 1:21](https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/1/Matthew-1-21.html), it says, "She will bear a son, and you shall call his name Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins." The name Jesus is derived from the Latin form of the Greek form of Yeshua, which means "Yahweh saves." Both Yahweh and Jesus are equated as the one who saves His people from their sins.

### **Why This Matters**

Understanding the meaning of Yahweh helps us grasp the nature and character of God. It reveals that God is self-existent and self-sufficient, not dependent on anyone or anything. He is faithful to His promises and desires a personal relationship with His people. Recognizing Yahweh as the covenant name for the God of Israel deepens our understanding of His involvement in human history and His plan for redemption.

### **Think About It**

Reflecting on the significance of God's self-existence and self-sufficiency can lead us to trust Him more fully. When we understand that God is not dependent on anyone or anything, we can have confidence in His power and provision. Recognizing Yahweh as the covenant-keeping God who fulfills His promises encourages us to hold onto hope and seek a deeper relationship with Him. How does knowing the meaning of Yahweh impact your understanding of who God is?

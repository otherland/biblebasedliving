## Jesus' Childhood

The Bible provides limited information about Jesus' childhood, with the exception of [Luke 2:41](https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/2/Luke-2-41.html)–52. Apart from this incident, we have few details about Jesus' early years. However, from the account in Luke, we can gather a few important aspects regarding Jesus' childhood.

### Devout Parents

Jesus was raised by parents who were devout in their religious observances. According to Jewish law, Joseph and Mary made an annual pilgrimage to Jerusalem for the Feast of the Passover. When Jesus was 12 years old, they brought Him along on the trip to celebrate the Feast together. This demonstrates that His parents were committed to fulfilling their religious obligations.

### In the Temple

During the Feast of the Passover in Jerusalem, Jesus stayed behind in the temple while His parents left to return home. It is important to note that Jesus' decision to remain in the temple was not mischievous or disobedient. Instead, it was a natural result of His understanding that He needed to be about His Father's business. In this incident, we see Jesus displaying extraordinary wisdom and knowledge, astonishing the temple teachers with His understanding. Additionally, Jesus listened attentively and asked questions of His elders, showing respect and taking the role of a humble student.

#### Why This Matters

This incident highlights Jesus' unique qualities even at a young age. It showcases His wisdom and understanding, setting Him apart from others. It also emphasizes the importance of being attentive to God's calling and having a desire to learn from those who are wiser and more experienced.

#### Think About It

Consider how Jesus' actions in the temple demonstrate His commitment to fulfilling God's purpose for His life. Reflect on your own willingness to learn from others and seek wisdom in your spiritual journey.

### Obedience to Parents

After staying in the temple, Jesus returned home with His parents to Nazareth. The Bible tells us that He was obedient to them. This obedience to His earthly parents aligns with the fifth commandment, which emphasizes honoring one's father and mother. Jesus' submission to His parents was an essential part of His perfect obedience to the Mosaic law, which He fulfilled on our behalf.

### Growth and Favor

The Bible tells us that Jesus grew in wisdom and stature and in favor with God and men ([Luke 2:52](https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/2/Luke-2-52.html)). This implies that as Jesus progressed through childhood and into adolescence, He experienced normal human growth physically, intellectually, and spiritually. It also indicates that Jesus was esteemed and respected by both God and those around Him.

#### Why This Matters

Jesus' growth in wisdom and favor emphasizes His humanity. Despite being the Son of God, He underwent the natural processes of development just like any other human being. This aspect of Jesus' life demonstrates His ability to relate to our human experiences.

#### Think About It

Contemplate the significance of Jesus' growth in wisdom and favor. Consider how this aspect of His life can inspire us to strive for personal growth and seek favor with God and others.

### Limited Information

While the Bible provides some insight into Jesus' childhood, it is important to note that little else is known about this period of His life. The Scriptures do not offer extensive details about His upbringing beyond the incident in the temple. However, it is crucial to trust that God has revealed all that we need to know about Jesus' childhood.

#### Why This Matters

The limited information about Jesus' childhood reminds us of the importance of trusting in God's sovereign plan. It reinforces the idea that God has intentionally chosen not to disclose certain aspects of Jesus' early years, and we should trust in His wisdom.

#### Think About It

Consider the reasons why God chose not to reveal more information about Jesus' childhood. Reflect on your trust in God's plan even when certain details are unknown or unclear.

### Extra-Biblical Accounts

Some extra-Biblical writings, such as the Gospel of Thomas, contain stories about Jesus' youth. However, it is important to note that the reliability of these accounts is uncertain. Without clear evidence or confirmation from reliable sources, it is challenging to determine the accuracy of these stories.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, the Bible provides limited information about Jesus' childhood. From the incident in the temple, we gain insights into Jesus' wisdom, respectfulness, and commitment to His Father's business. Additionally, His obedience to His parents exemplifies His fulfillment of the Mosaic law. The fact that Jesus grew in wisdom and favor with both God and men underscores His humanity and relatability. It is essential to trust in God's plan and accept that He has revealed all that we need to know about Jesus' childhood. While extra-Biblical accounts exist, their reliability remains uncertain. Ultimately, the focus should be on the information provided in the Bible, which serves as a reliable source for understanding Jesus' childhood.

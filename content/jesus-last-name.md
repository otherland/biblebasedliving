## Jesus: The Chosen One

When we talk about Jesus, we often refer to Him as "Jesus Christ." However, it's important to understand that Christ is not His last name but a title. In Greek, the word Christ is transliterated from a term meaning "Anointed One" or "Chosen One." Its Hebrew equivalent is the source of the word Messiah. So, when we say "Jesus Christ," we are acknowledging that Jesus is the Chosen One of God, the Messiah.

### The Distinction between Jesus and the Christ

In [Acts 18:5](https://www.bibleref.com/Acts/18/Acts-18-5.html), we see a clear distinction between the name Jesus and the title the Christ: "Paul was occupied with the word, testifying to the Jews that the Christ was Jesus" (ESV). This passage highlights that Paul's preaching was focused on proving that Jesus was indeed the Messiah, the Christ. Jesus, the man, fulfilled the role of the Christ as foretold in the Law and the Prophets.

### Identifying People in Biblical Times

Unlike today, people in biblical times did not have last names or surnames. Instead, they were identified in various ways. For instance, individuals with common names like Jesus would be distinguished through other means. Some were identified by their fathers' names, such as Levi, son of Alphaeus ([Mark 2:14](https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/2/Mark-2-14.html)), James, son of Zebedee ([Mark 3:17](https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/3/Mark-3-17.html)), James, son of Alphaeus (verse 18), and Bartimaeus, son of Timaeus ([Mark 10:46](https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/10/Mark-10-46.html)).

Others were known by their hometowns or home countries. For example, Jesus was often referred to as "Jesus of Nazareth" ([Mark 10:47](https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/10/Mark-10-47.html); [Luke 24:19](https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/24/Luke-24-19.html); [John 18:5](https://www.bibleref.com/John/18/John-18-5.html)). Similarly, individuals like Lucius of Cyrene ([Acts 13:1](https://www.bibleref.com/Acts/13/Acts-13-1.html)), Mary Magdalene ([Matthew 27:56](https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/27/Matthew-27-56.html)), and Judas Iscariot ([Matthew 10:4](https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/10/Matthew-10-4.html)) were identified by their places of origin.

Additionally, some people received nicknames to distinguish them from others with the same name. Jesus gave the disciple Simon the nickname Peter ([John 1:42](https://www.bibleref.com/John/1/John-1-42.html)). Another Simon was referred to as "Simon the Zealot" ([Matthew 10:4](https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/10/Matthew-10-4.html)).

### Understanding Jesus' Mission

While Christ is not Jesus' last name, referring to Him as "Jesus Christ" helps identify His mission in the world. Jesus has various titles, each revealing a different aspect of His identity and purpose. The angel told Mary that He would be called "the Son of God" ([Luke 1:35](https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/1/Luke-1-35.html)), and Isaiah prophesied that He would be known as "Immanuel" ([Isaiah 7:14](https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/7/Isaiah-7-14.html)). Others recognized Him as the "Son of David" ([Matthew 15:22](https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/15/Matthew-15-22.html)).

Regardless of the title we use, we must acknowledge that "there is salvation in no one else!" God has given us no other name under heaven through which we can be saved ([Acts 4:12](https://www.bibleref.com/Acts/4/Acts-4-12.html), NLT). As Christians, we believe that Jesus has been given "the name above all names," and one day, every knee will bow and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord ([Philippians 2:9](https://www.bibleref.com/Philippians/2/Philippians-2-9.html)â€“11).

### Why This Matters

Understanding the significance of Jesus' title as the Christ deepens our appreciation for His role in fulfilling God's plan for salvation. Recognizing that Christ is not a last name but a title helps us grasp the biblical narrative more accurately. By acknowledging Jesus as the Chosen One, we affirm His unique position as the Messiah and Savior.

### Think About It

Consider how knowing that Christ is not Jesus' last name but a title impacts your understanding of biblical references to Jesus. How does this knowledge enhance your understanding of Jesus' mission and purpose? Reflect on the significance of Jesus being identified by various titles and what they reveal about His identity.

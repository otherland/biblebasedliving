## Jesus of Nazareth

Jesus of Nazareth is a significant figure in Christian theology and is often referred to by this specific name. The name "Jesus of Nazareth" is used to distinguish him from others who share the same name and also to identify his place of residence. In biblical times, people were often identified by their native area or place of residence. This naming convention helps to provide clarity and context when referring to individuals.

### 1. Jesus' Residence in Nazareth

Jesus spent a significant part of his life in the town of Nazareth before beginning his public ministry. After Joseph, Mary, and Jesus returned from Egypt, where they had fled to protect Jesus from Herod, they settled in Nazareth. This was done to fulfill what was said through the prophets: "He will be called a Nazarene" ([Matthew 2:23](https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/2/Matthew-2-23.html)). Although this specific prophecy is not found in any of the books of the Old Testament, it is believed that it refers to the humble origin of the Messiah, who would be despised and rejected.

### 2. Significance of Being Called a Nazarene

Being called a Nazarene carried a certain connotation during that time. The people of Nazareth were often despised and condemned, and their reputation influenced how others perceived those associated with the town. Nathanael's response to Philip's announcement about Jesus, "Can anything good come from Nazareth?" ([John 1:46](https://www.bibleref.com/John/1/John-1-46.html)), reflects this perception. The phrase "Jesus of Nazareth" implies an association with a despised and lowly birth.

### Why This Matters:

Understanding the significance of Jesus being called "Jesus of Nazareth" helps us appreciate the humble circumstances surrounding his birth and upbringing. It also highlights the fulfillment of prophecies that predicted the Messiah's lowly origins and rejection by men.

### Think About It:

Consider how Jesus' identity as "Jesus of Nazareth" challenges our preconceived notions about power, influence, and social status. How does his association with a despised town impact our understanding of his mission and purpose?

## The Impact of Jesus

Although Jesus of Nazareth was born and raised in humble circumstances, his impact on the world has been greater than anyone who has ever lived. He came to fulfill the purpose of saving humanity from their sins, a feat that could only be accomplished by God incarnate.

### 3. Identifying Jesus' Purpose

Jesus' purpose on earth was clearly stated when an angel appeared to Joseph in a dream, saying, "She will give birth to a son, and you are to give him the name Jesus because he will save his people from their sins" ([Matthew 1:21](https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/1/Matthew-1-21.html)). This declaration revealed that Jesus' mission was to bring salvation to humanity by reconciling them with God.

### 4. Fulfillment of Prophecies

Throughout his life and ministry, Jesus fulfilled numerous prophecies found in the Old Testament. These prophecies foretold many aspects of his life, including his birth, ministry, crucifixion, and resurrection. The fulfillment of these prophecies provides evidence of Jesus' divine identity and purpose.

#### The Prophecy of Jesus' Humility

One prophecy that sheds light on Jesus' humble origins is found in Isaiah 53. This passage speaks of the Messiah as "a root out of dry ground" who would have no form or comeliness. It describes him as being despised and rejected by men, with people hiding their faces from him and esteeming him not ([Isaiah 53:2-3](https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/53/Isaiah-53-2.html)). By being "Jesus of Nazareth," Jesus fully embodies the humility and rejection foretold by this prophecy.

### Why This Matters:

Recognizing the fulfillment of prophecies in Jesus' life strengthens the belief that he is the promised Messiah. It provides evidence of his divine nature and reinforces the credibility of the biblical accounts.

### Think About It:

Reflect on the prophecies fulfilled in Jesus' life and consider how they impact your understanding of his identity and mission. How do these fulfillments strengthen your faith in him as the Son of God?

### 5. The Name "Jesus"

The name "Jesus" holds great importance as it reveals Jesus' role as the Savior. The angel who appeared to Joseph instructed him to name the child Jesus because he would save people from their sins ([Matthew 1:21](https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/1/Matthew-1-21.html)). The name "Jesus" derives from the Hebrew name "Yeshua," which means "Yahweh saves." This name highlights Jesus' divine mission to reconcile humanity with God through salvation.

### 6. The Association with Nazareth

The association with Nazareth further emphasizes Jesus' humble background and the fulfillment of prophecies concerning the Messiah's rejection and lowly origins. Being referred to as "Jesus of Nazareth" highlights his identification with a despised town and underscores his role as a humble servant.

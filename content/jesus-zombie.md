## Jesus' Resurrection: A True Return to Life

### Introduction
The idea of Jesus being a zombie has been raised in popular culture, particularly in relation to zombies and the concept of a zombie apocalypse. While some may ask this question to discredit the resurrection altogether, others may genuinely wonder if there are any similarities between Jesus' resurrection and the reanimation of a zombie. In order to address this question, it is important to understand the definition of a zombie and how it differs from the Christian belief about Jesus' resurrection.

### What is a Zombie?
In popular culture, a zombie is typically defined as "a dead person's body, reanimated but continuing the process of decay." This portrayal of zombies is often seen in the sub-genre of horror literature and films. The concept of zombies originated from Haitian Voodoo practices of zombification, where a dead body is believed to be possessed and utilized by a demon. Another depiction of zombies involves a person's soul returning to their body, causing it to move again while still technically dead. More recently, zombies have been portrayed as part of a modern-day plague, with an infection that transforms humans into strong, energetic, and deadly creatures.

### Jesus' Resurrection: A True Return to Life
The idea that Jesus' resurrection could be compared to being a zombie is not accurate when considering the biblical account. Jesus' resurrection was not a reanimation but a true return to life. When Jesus was resurrected, His physical body was perfected and glorified. His resurrection body does not experience decay, has no appearance of death, and is forever immune from death, injury, and sickness. In no sense can Jesus be considered still dead. As [Revelation 1:18](https://www.bibleref.com/Revelation/1/Revelation-1-18.html) states, "I am the Living One; I was dead, and now look, I am alive for ever and ever!"

### Why This Matters
Understanding the distinction between Jesus' resurrection and the concept of zombies is crucial for believers. Jesus' resurrection is a foundational belief in Christianity, demonstrating His victory over sin and death. By being raised to life, Jesus conquered the power of death and offers eternal life to all who believe in Him. Recognizing the uniqueness of Jesus' resurrection helps us appreciate the significance of our own future resurrection as believers.

### Think About It
Consider the implications of Jesus' resurrection being a true return to life rather than a reanimation as seen in zombie lore. How does this truth impact your understanding of Jesus' power over death and the hope we have in Him? How does it shape your view of your own future resurrection?

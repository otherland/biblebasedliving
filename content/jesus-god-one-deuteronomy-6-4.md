Title: Discover the One God of Deuteronomy 6:4 - Unveiling the Ultimate Truth
---

## Jesus, God, and [Deuteronomy 6:4](https://www.bibleref.com/Deuteronomy/6/Deuteronomy-6-4.html)

[Deuteronomy 6:4](https://www.bibleref.com/Deuteronomy/6/Deuteronomy-6-4.html) states, "Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God, the LORD is one." This verse has been foundational in Judaism and is also significant for Christians. However, some may wonder how Christianity reconciles this belief in the oneness of God with the belief that Jesus is also God. In order to understand this, we need to delve into the meaning of [Deuteronomy 6:4](https://www.bibleref.com/Deuteronomy/6/Deuteronomy-6-4.html) and explore the Christian understanding of the Trinity.

### The Meaning of "The LORD is One"

When [Deuteronomy 6:4](https://www.bibleref.com/Deuteronomy/6/Deuteronomy-6-4.html) says "The LORD is one," it is important to note that the Hebrew word for "one" used here is "echad." This word signifies unity rather than singularity. It is also used in [Genesis 2:24](https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/2/Genesis-2-24.html) to describe how a husband and wife become "one" flesh. Clearly, this does not mean they become a singular being. Instead, it emphasizes their unity with each other. Furthermore, it is worth mentioning that there is a Hebrew word that denotes absolute singularity, "yachid," but it is not used in reference to God in the Hebrew Scriptures.

Therefore, when [Deuteronomy 6:4](https://www.bibleref.com/Deuteronomy/6/Deuteronomy-6-4.html) says "The LORD is one," it affirms the biblical teaching of one God. It does not imply a denial of the possibility of multiple persons within the Godhead.

### The Doctrine of the Trinity

The Christian belief in Jesus as God does not contradict [Deuteronomy 6:4](https://www.bibleref.com/Deuteronomy/6/Deuteronomy-6-4.html) because Christians understand the one true God to exist in three distinct persons: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. This belief is encapsulated in the doctrine of the Trinity.

In [Matthew 28:19](https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/28/Matthew-28-19.html), Jesus instructs his followers to baptize new disciples in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. This indicates that all three persons are functioning as the same God. Another instance where all three persons of the Trinity are simultaneously present is during the baptism of Jesus. [Luke 3:21-22](https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/3/Luke-3-21.html) recounts how Jesus was baptized, the Holy Spirit descended upon him in the form of a dove, and a voice from heaven declared, "You are my Son, whom I love; with you I am well pleased." This event demonstrates the unity and coexistence of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.

### The Deity of Jesus

Each person of the Trinity is referred to as God in the Bible. While the Father is explicitly called God, Jesus is also referred to as God in several passages such as [John 1:1](https://www.bibleref.com/John/1/John-1-1.html); 14; [Romans 9:5](https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/9/Romans-9-5.html); [Colossians 2:9](https://www.bibleref.com/Colossians/2/Colossians-2-9.html); [Hebrews 1:8](https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/1/Hebrews-1-8.html)–9; and [1 John 5:20](https://www.bibleref.com/1-John/5/1-John-5-20.html). Likewise, the Holy Spirit is identified as God in [Acts 5:3](https://www.bibleref.com/Acts/5/Acts-5-3.html)–4 and [1 Corinthians 3:16](https://www.bibleref.com/1-Corinthians/3/1-Corinthians-3-16.html).

Some may argue that God cannot have a Son in the traditional sense of human procreation. However, the Father/Son relationship within the Trinity is not about biological birth but rather serves as a metaphor to help us grasp the inner workings of the Trinity. The Son and the Holy Spirit have existed eternally alongside the Father, enjoying perfect fellowship within the Trinity. In this way, God exists in both perfect unity and community.

### Why This Matters

Understanding the relationship between Jesus and God is crucial for Christians because it shapes our understanding of salvation and our relationship with God. If Jesus is not truly God, then his sacrifice on the cross would not have been sufficient to atone for our sins. However, if Jesus is indeed God, then his death and resurrection hold tremendous significance for our redemption.

### Think About It

The concept of the Trinity can be complex and challenging to fully comprehend. Yet, it reveals the depth and richness of God's nature. Just as a husband and wife can be united in marriage while still maintaining their individual identities, so too can the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit exist as distinct persons while being united in the Godhead. The Trinity illustrates the perfect love and unity that exists within God.

As Christians, we can find comfort and assurance in knowing that our salvation is secure because Jesus, as both fully human and fully divine, has accomplished our redemption. Embracing this truth deepens our relationship with God and enables us to experience the fullness of his love and grace.

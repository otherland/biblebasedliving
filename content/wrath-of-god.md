## The Wrath of God

The concept of the wrath of God is often understood as the emotional response to perceived wrong and injustice. It can be translated as anger, indignation, vexation, or irritation. Both humans and God express wrath, but there is a significant difference between the wrath of God and the wrath of man. God's wrath is always holy and justified, while man's wrath is rarely justified and never holy.

### The Wrath of God in the Old Testament

In the Old Testament, we see that the wrath of God is a divine response to human sin and disobedience. One common trigger for divine wrath was idolatry, as described in [Psalm 78:56-66](https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/78/Psalm-78-56.html). The Old Testament consistently portrays God's wrath directed towards those who do not follow His will ([Deuteronomy 1:26-46](https://www.bibleref.com/Deuteronomy/1/Deuteronomy-1-26.html), [Joshua 7:1](https://www.bibleref.com/Joshua/7/Joshua-7-1.html), [Psalm 2:1-6](https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/2/Psalm-2-1.html)). The prophets also spoke about a future day of wrath ([Zephaniah 1:14-15](https://www.bibleref.com/Zephaniah/1/Zephaniah-1-14.html)). God's wrath against sin and disobedience is justified because His plan for mankind is holy and perfect, just as He Himself is.

To turn away God's wrath, repentance is necessary. God provided a way for sinners to gain divine favor through repentance. Rejecting this perfect plan means rejecting God's love, mercy, grace, and favor, thereby incurring His righteous wrath.

### The Wrath of God in the New Testament

The New Testament also supports the idea of God as a God of wrath who judges sin. We find an example of this in the story of the rich man and Lazarus, where serious consequences are portrayed for the unrepentant sinner ([Luke 16:19](https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/16/Luke-16-19.html)–31). [John 3:36](https://www.bibleref.com/John/3/John-3-36.html) states that whoever believes in Jesus has eternal life, but whoever rejects Him will not see life because God's wrath remains on them. Jesus took upon Himself God's wrath for our sins when He died on the cross ([Romans 5:6](https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/5/Romans-5-6.html)–11). Those who do not believe in Jesus will face judgment on the day of wrath ([Romans 2:5](https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/2/Romans-2-5.html)–6).

### The Difference Between God's Wrath and Human Wrath

In contrast to God's holy wrath, human wrath is warned against in the Bible. [Romans 12:19](https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/12/Romans-12-19.html), [Ephesians 4:26](https://www.bibleref.com/Ephesians/4/Ephesians-4-26.html), and [Colossians 3:8-10](https://www.bibleref.com/Colossians/3/Colossians-3-8.html) caution against human wrath. Only God is able to avenge because His vengeance is perfect and holy, while human wrath is sinful and opens the door to demonic influence. As Christians, anger and wrath are inconsistent with our new nature in Christ ([2 Corinthians 5:17](https://www.bibleref.com/2-Corinthians/5/2-Corinthians-5-17.html)). To be free from wrath, believers need the Holy Spirit to sanctify and cleanse their hearts from these feelings. Romans 8 shows victory over sin in the life of someone living in the Spirit ([Romans 8:5-8](https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/8/Romans-8-5.html)). [Philippians 4:4-7](https://www.bibleref.com/Philippians/4/Philippians-4-4.html) teaches us that a mind controlled by the Spirit is filled with peace.

### Why This Matters

Understanding the concept of God's wrath is crucial for Christians. It reminds us of the seriousness of sin and disobedience. It also highlights the importance of repentance and belief in Jesus as the only way to escape God's wrath. Recognizing the difference between God's holy wrath and our own sinful anger helps us cultivate a Christ-like character filled with love, mercy, and grace.

### Think About It

1. How does knowing about God's wrath affect your understanding of sin and disobedience?
2. Reflect on your own emotions and actions during times of anger or wrath. How can you align yourself more with Christ's nature?
3. Consider the significance of Jesus taking upon Himself God's wrath for our sins. How does this impact your relationship with Him?

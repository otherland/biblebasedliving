## Unlimited Love: A Reflection of God's Nature

God's love is a foundational attribute, an essential part of who He is. It is a love that knows no boundaries, measurements, or exceptions. God's love is unlimited, far beyond human comprehension, and serves as the wellspring of all forms of human love. In fact, human affections pale in comparison to the unlimited love of the Father, who is love Himself.

### God's Love: Beyond Human Comprehension

God's love surpasses our understanding. It goes beyond what we can fathom or imagine. [Psalm 103:8-12](https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/103/Psalm-103-8.html) reminds us that God's love is as high as the heavens are above the earth and that He removes our sins from us as far as the east is from the west. This demonstrates the vastness of His love and its ability to bring about forgiveness and restoration.

### No One Beyond Redemption

Because God's love is unlimited, no one is beyond redemption. Even those who seem to have committed the most heinous acts can experience transformation through the revelation of God's grace. A powerful example of this is found in the testimony of David Berkowitz, also known as the "Son of Sam," a notorious serial killer who found salvation in prison. His story serves as a reminder that there is no sin too great for God to forgive. As [Romans 5:20](https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/5/Romans-5-20.html) tells us, "where sin increased, grace abounded all the more" (NLT).

### The Testimony of Comrade Duch

The story of Comrade Duch, a Khmer Rouge killer who later found redemption at the cross, also illustrates the unlimited nature of God's love. Duch committed grievous atrocities, yet he too experienced the transformative power of God's grace. His life serves as a testament to the fact that even the vilest sinner can find forgiveness and redemption in Christ. The Bible makes it clear that when it says God loves the world, there are no exceptions. God's grace is inexhaustible.

### The Love of the Triune God

God's unlimited love is further evident in the love shared by the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit within the Trinity. This eternal and unending relationship demonstrates a selfless and sacrificial love. Jesus declared that the Father loves Him and has placed everything in His hands ([John 3:35](https://www.bibleref.com/John/3/John-3-35.html)). The Father also expressed His love for His Son, saying, "This is my Son, whom I love; with him, I am well pleased. Listen to him!" ([Matthew 17:5](https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/17/Matthew-17-5.html)).

### The Unified Work of Salvation

The unlimited love of God secures our salvation. The Father's justice was satisfied through the sacrifice of the Son, who bore the penalty for our sins. When we place our faith in Jesus Christ, the Holy Spirit regenerates us and takes up residence within us. This unified work of all three Persons of the Trinity ensures our salvation and demonstrates the depth of God's love for us.

### The Offense and Foolishness of God's Love

While God's love is unlimited, deep, and profound, it is not His only attribute revealed in Scripture. God is also infinitely holy and perfectly just. The sacrifice of Jesus on the cross reflects not only God's love but also His holiness and justice. The cross demonstrates how seriously God views sin, as He poured out the just penalty on Christ while offering His Son for our transgressions.

## Why This Matters

Understanding and embracing the concept of unlimited love is crucial for every believer. It reveals the overwhelming grace and mercy of God, emphasizing that no one is beyond redemption. This truth challenges our human tendency to judge others or deem certain sins unforgivable. It humbles us by reminding us that we too are recipients of this unlimited love.

## Think About It

1. Reflect on times when you may have struggled to accept that God's love is unlimited. How does the concept of unlimited love challenge your own understanding of forgiveness and grace?

2. Consider the testimonies of individuals like David Berkowitz and Comrade Duch. How do their stories demonstrate the transforming power of God's love? How does their redemption reflect the unlimited nature of God's grace?

3. Contemplate the depth and significance of the love shared within the Trinity. How does this eternal, selfless, and sacrificial love impact your understanding of God's love for you?

4. Ponder the offense and foolishness of God's unlimited love in the eyes of skeptics. How can we respond to those who struggle to comprehend or accept the concept of an unlimited, all-encompassing love?

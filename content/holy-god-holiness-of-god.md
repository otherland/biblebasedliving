## The Holiness of God: Understanding His Majestic Being and Moral Purity

The holiness of God is a foundational concept in Christian theology. It refers to the unparalleled majesty of His incomparable being and His blameless, faultless, and unblemished moral purity. When we speak of God's holiness, we are acknowledging that He is set apart from everything else in existence. In this article, we will explore the holiness of God, its significance, and its implications for our lives.

### **The Two Meanings of Holy**

In Christian theology, the word "holy" has two meanings. First, it refers to God Himself as the epitome of perfection and righteousness. God is eternal, preeminent, omnipotent, omniscient, and omnipresent. He is beyond full human comprehension and our language lacks the superlatives necessary to justly describe Him. We are drawn to Him for His unequaled goodness and majesty.

Secondly, holy also refers to something or someone that has been set apart for God's use or separated from the common. For example, in the Old Testament, there were vessels in the temple that were set aside for use by God's priests. When Belshazzar profaned these holy artifacts by using them for idol worship, he committed sacrilege.

### **The Ambivalence of Human Response**

The holiness of God brings about a mixture of attraction and dread in the hearts and minds of mortal man. We are drawn to Him because He is our Creator who made us in His image. However, as inherently flawed creatures, we also cower in fear when faced with the all-revealing light of His majestic glory.

In [Isaiah 6:1](https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/6/Isaiah-6-1.html)–5, the prophet Isaiah stood in awestruck wonder before the Lord. Yet, at the same time, he recoiled in reverential fear because of his own unworthiness and sinfulness. This ambivalence of attraction and dread is also seen in the experiences of other biblical figures such as Daniel and the apostle John.

### **The Holiness of God Revealed**

Throughout the Bible, we see the holiness of God revealed in various ways. The Scriptures affirm that there is none holy like the Lord and that there is no rock like our God. God's actions are just, true, and deserving of our reverential fear and respect. He alone is holy, and all nations will come to worship Him.

### **Why This Matters: Awe and Reverence**

Understanding the holiness of God should lead us to a place of awe and reverence. We should be in awe of His greatness, goodness, and perfection. Our hearts should be filled with reverence for His holiness and the fact that He is set apart from all that is sinful and evil.

Recognizing God's holiness also helps us understand our own need for redemption. In the presence of God's holiness, we become acutely aware of our own sinfulness and unworthiness. It is only through Jesus Christ, who was sinless and gave His life as a sacrifice for our sins, that we can be made right with God.

### **Think About It: Reflecting God's Holiness**

As believers, we are called to reflect the holiness of God in our lives. While we will not achieve sinless perfection on this side of eternity, our conduct should align with His moral purity. We are called to be salt and light in the world, preserving godly values and pointing others towards Christ.

Living a holy life means being set apart from the sinful behaviors and attitudes prevalent in society. It means seeking to imitate Christ's example of love, compassion, forgiveness, and righteousness. By doing so, we bring honor to God and become agents of transformation and renewal in the world.

### **The Holiness of God and Our Relationship with Him**

The holiness of God should not only evoke reverence and awe but also draw us into an intimate relationship with Him. Despite our sinfulness, God desires to have a personal relationship with us. Through faith in Jesus Christ, we are adopted as His children and can call Him "Father." It is through the redemptive work of Jesus that we can approach God with confidence and receive His forgiveness and grace.

### **Conclusion**

In conclusion, the holiness of God is a foundational concept in Christian theology. It refers to His unparalleled majesty and faultless moral purity. Recognizing God's holiness should lead us to awe and reverence, as well as an understanding of our need for redemption. As believers, we are called to reflect His holiness in our lives and to have an intimate relationship with Him. May we continually seek to know and understand the holiness of God as we grow in our faith and walk with Him.

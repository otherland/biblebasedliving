## Marriage Preservation Programs: Nurturing Strong Christian Marriages
Marriage is a sacred institution designed by God to reflect His love for His people. In today's world, where marriages are facing numerous challenges, it is crucial for Christians to seek ways to preserve and strengthen the bonds of matrimony.

## 2. How do marriage preservation programs differ from traditional marriage counseling?

Marriage preservation programs complement traditional marriage counseling but offer a distinct approach.

These couples share their stories of redemption, provide practical tools, and teach biblical principles for saving and strengthening marriages.

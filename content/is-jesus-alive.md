## Is Jesus Alive?

As Christians, we believe that Jesus Christ is alive. While the idea of someone rising from the dead may seem difficult to comprehend, it is supported by historical evidence and biblical teachings. In this article, we will explore the concept of Jesus' resurrection and explain why it matters to our faith.

### Jesus' Pre-Existence and Eternal Life
Before discussing Jesus' resurrection, it is important to understand that He existed before His earthly life. According to [Philippians 2:5](https://www.bibleref.com/Philippians/2/Philippians-2-5.html)–11 and [John 1:1](https://www.bibleref.com/John/1/John-1-1.html)–3, Jesus was already alive as one with God before the creation of the world. The eternal Son of God has always been alive. Therefore, when Jesus was crucified and buried, His spirit was still alive.

### The Promise of Eternal Life
Throughout His ministry, Jesus spoke about life beyond the physical world. He promised eternal life to those who believed in Him ([John 3:16](https://www.bibleref.com/John/3/John-3-16.html)–18) and explained that His kingdom was not of this world ([John 18:36](https://www.bibleref.com/John/18/John-18-36.html)). This concept of eternal life goes beyond our earthly existence and encompasses the spiritual realm.

### The Breath of Life and the Spirit
When God created the first man, He breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, making him a living soul ([Genesis 2:7](https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/2/Genesis-2-7.html)). This life came directly from God, who is eternal. Humans have a spirit that is meant to live forever, just as God will live forever. While our bodies may die, our spirits continue to exist.

### Jesus' Death and Resurrection
When Jesus died on the cross, His body truly died and was buried, but His spirit remained alive. He committed His spirit into the Father's hands ([Luke 23:46](https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/23/Luke-23-46.html)). On the third day, God raised Jesus from the dead, reuniting His spirit with a glorified body ([Philippians 3:21](https://www.bibleref.com/Philippians/3/Philippians-3-21.html)). Over five hundred people witnessed Jesus after His resurrection ([1 Corinthians 15:6](https://www.bibleref.com/1-Corinthians/15/1-Corinthians-15-6.html)), and the New Testament was written by eyewitnesses who confirmed that Jesus was truly alive.

### Jesus' Ascension and Current State
Forty days after His resurrection, Jesus ascended bodily into heaven in the presence of His disciples ([Acts 1:9](https://www.bibleref.com/Acts/1/Acts-1-9.html)–11). He returned to the Father, as He had predicted ([John 14:1](https://www.bibleref.com/John/14/John-14-1.html)–2; [John 20:17](https://www.bibleref.com/John/20/John-20-17.html)). Today, Jesus is alive in heaven with God, the angels, and all those who have trusted in Him for salvation ([2 Corinthians 5:8](https://www.bibleref.com/2-Corinthians/5/2-Corinthians-5-8.html)). He sits at the right hand of the Father ([Colossians 3:1](https://www.bibleref.com/Colossians/3/Colossians-3-1.html)) and intercedes for His followers on earth ([Hebrews 7:25](https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/7/Hebrews-7-25.html)). Furthermore, Jesus has promised to return again ([John 14:1](https://www.bibleref.com/John/14/John-14-1.html)–2).

### The Significance of Jesus' Resurrection
The resurrection of Jesus holds immense significance for Christians. It confirms that Jesus is the Son of God and that His sacrifice on the cross was accepted by God. It also gives us hope for eternal life. Just as Jesus' spirit never died, our spirits will also live forever ([John 11:25](https://www.bibleref.com/John/11/John-11-25.html)–26). How we respond to God's offer of salvation determines our destiny.

### Why This Matters
The belief in Jesus' resurrection is foundational to Christianity. Without His resurrection, our faith would lose its power. The resurrection proves that sin and death have been conquered through Christ's sacrifice, offering forgiveness and eternal life to all who believe. It assures us that we serve a living Savior who continues to be actively involved in our lives.

### Think About It
Consider the significance of Jesus' resurrection in your own life. How does the assurance of eternal life impact your faith? Reflect on the hope and joy that come from knowing that death is not the end but a doorway to everlasting life with God. Let the truth of Jesus' resurrection strengthen your faith and inspire you to share the good news with others.

## King of Glory: The Majesty of God

In the book of Psalms, we find a series of verses that refer to the "King of glory." These verses, found in Psalm 24, convey a sense of awe and reverence for God. They invite us to consider the magnitude and power of our Creator. Let's explore this concept and its significance in our lives.

### The King of Glory Revealed

[Psalm 24:7-10](https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/24/Psalm-24-7.html) says, "Lift up your heads, you gates; be lifted up, you ancient doors, that the King of glory may come in. Who is this King of glory? The Lord strong and mighty, the Lord mighty in battle. Lift up your heads, you gates; lift them up, you ancient doors, that the King of glory may come in. Who is he, this King of glory? The Lord Almightyâ€”he is the King of glory."

The Hebrew word translated as "glory" in Psalm 24 carries the connotation of solemnity and power. It signifies weightiness and importance. Thus, calling God the "King of Glory" means recognizing Him as the most awe-inspiring and powerful ruler, deserving of our utmost respect.

The psalmist employs a form of personification known as apostrophe when addressing the "gates" and "ancient doors." This poetic technique commands them to open wide and allow the entrance of the King of glory. Even if these doors are already lofty, they must rise even higher to admit such an exalted presence as the Lord Himself.

### Connecting with Shekinah Glory

There is a connection between the King of glory in Psalm 24 and the Shekinah glory described in Exodus 33. When God instructed Moses to build the Ark of the Covenant, He promised to appear in a cloud over the atonement cover or mercy seat ([Leviticus 16:2](https://www.bibleref.com/Leviticus/16/Leviticus-16-2.html)). The mercy seat was seen as God's glorious throne on earth. It was from this mercy seat that God spoke to Moses ([Exodus 25:22](https://www.bibleref.com/Exodus/25/Exodus-25-22.html)).

Psalm 24 likely commemorates the entrance of the Ark of the Covenant into Jerusalem during David's reign ([2 Samuel 6:12-17](https://www.bibleref.com/2-Samuel/6/2-Samuel-6-12.html)) or into the temple during Solomon's reign ([2 Chronicles 5:7](https://www.bibleref.com/2-Chronicles/5/2-Chronicles-5-7.html)). The King of glory, represented by the Ark, entered through the gates of Jerusalem and the doors of the temple in a grand procession.

### Jesus as the King of Glory

In [1 Corinthians 2:8](https://www.bibleref.com/1-Corinthians/2/1-Corinthians-2-8.html), Jesus is referred to as "the Lord of glory." His triumphal entry into Jerusalem, where He was hailed by a jubilant crowd (Matthew 21), can be seen as a fulfillment of Psalm 24. Jesus is the one with clean hands and a pure heart who ascends the mountain of the Lord ([Psalm 24:3-4](https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/24/Psalm-24-3.html)). He receives blessings from the Lord (verse 5) and is proclaimed as the "King of glory, the Lord strong and mighty, the Lord mighty in battle" (verse 8).

### Why This Matters

Understanding God as the King of glory helps us grasp His majesty and power. It reminds us that we serve a God who is worthy of our reverence and awe. Recognizing His authority and sovereignty can deepen our faith and inspire us to worship Him wholeheartedly.

Furthermore, recognizing Jesus as the King of glory has profound implications for our salvation. Through His sacrificial death and resurrection, Jesus conquered sin and death, demonstrating His power and might. Embracing Him as our Lord and Savior allows us to enter into a personal relationship with the King of glory and experience His love, grace, and forgiveness.

### Think About It

1. Reflect on a time when you were truly in awe of God's majesty. How did it impact your faith and perspective?
2. In what ways can recognizing Jesus as the King of glory shape your daily life and interactions with others?
3. How does understanding God's glory influence your worship and devotion?

As we contemplate the concept of the King of glory, may we be filled with a deep sense of reverence and awe for our majestic God. Let us worship Him with all our hearts, acknowledging His authority and sovereignty in our lives. May we also find comfort and hope in Jesus, the King of glory, who has triumphed over sin and death on our behalf.

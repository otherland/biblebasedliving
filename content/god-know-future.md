Title: 'Divine Revelation: How God Knows the Future Unfolding'

## God's Knowledge of the Future

The Bible, as the word of God, contains accurate prophetic content. One example is the prophecy that Christ would be born in Bethlehem of Judea, which was foretold in [Micah 5:2](https://www.bibleref.com/Micah/5/Micah-5-2.html). Micah made this prophecy around 700 B.C., and it was fulfilled centuries later when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea ([Luke 2:1-20](https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/2/Luke-2-1.html); [Matthew 2:1-12](https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/2/Matthew-2-1.html)). This fulfillment demonstrates the accuracy and reliability of the Bible's prophetic claims.

Peter Stoner, in his book "Science Speaks," has shown that the probability of coincidence in prophetic Scripture is extremely low. By examining just eight prophecies concerning Christ, Stoner found that the chance of any one man fulfilling all eight prophecies is 1 in 10 to the 17th power. That would be 1 chance in 100,000,000,000,000,000. Considering Jesus fulfilled many more than just eight prophecies, it is evident that the Bible accurately foretells the future. 

The Bible declares that God has the ability to foretell the future. [Isaiah 46:9-10](https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/46/Isaiah-46-9.html) states, "Remember the former things long past, for I am God, and there is no other; I am God and there is no one like Me, declaring the end from the beginning, and from ancient times things which have not been done, saying, 'My purpose will be established, and I will accomplish all My good pleasure.'" This passage emphasizes that God is unmatched in His ability to declare the end from the beginning. He can stand at the start and accurately predict what will happen.

God possesses omniscience; He knows everything that is actual and possible. Additionally, God is eternal ([Psalm 90:2](https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/90/Psalm-90-2.html)). As an eternal and omniscient being, He has experienced our past, present, and future. He is the Alpha and Omega, the Beginning and the End ([Revelation 21:6](https://www.bibleref.com/Revelation/21/Revelation-21-6.html)). This means that God has complete knowledge of all time periods.

While there are still prophecies in the Bible that await fulfillment, we can trust that they will come to pass because God knows the future. Events are unfolding according to His plan and timing. As believers, we can take comfort in knowing that the one true, personal, eternal, and all-knowing God of the Bible holds the future in His hands.

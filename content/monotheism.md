Title: 7 Proven Benefits of Embracing Monotheism in Christianity

## Monotheism

Monotheism is the belief in one true God who is the only creator, sustainer, and judge of all creation. It differs from henotheism, which believes in multiple gods with one supreme God over all, and polytheism, which is the belief in the existence of more than one god.

### The Biblical Basis for Monotheism

The Bible provides several verses that support monotheism. In [Deuteronomy 4:35](https://www.bibleref.com/Deuteronomy/4/Deuteronomy-4-35.html), it is stated that "You were shown these things so that you might know that the LORD is God; besides Him there is no other." [Deuteronomy 6:4](https://www.bibleref.com/Deuteronomy/6/Deuteronomy-6-4.html) says, "Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God, the LORD is one." Other verses such as Malachi 2:10a, [1 Corinthians 8:6](https://www.bibleref.com/1-Corinthians/8/1-Corinthians-8-6.html), [Ephesians 4:6](https://www.bibleref.com/Ephesians/4/Ephesians-4-6.html), [1 Timothy 2:5](https://www.bibleref.com/1-Timothy/2/1-Timothy-2-5.html), and [James 2:19](https://www.bibleref.com/James/2/James-2-19.html) also emphasize the belief in one God.

While these biblical references may not be convincing for those who do not believe in the authority of the Bible, they serve as a starting point for those who are familiar with its teachings. Moreover, the supernatural evidence presented in Scripture and the life and resurrection of Jesus Christ can provide additional support for monotheism.

### Historical Anthropology and Monotheism

The study of historical anthropology reveals an interesting trend in religious development. Contrary to the popular evolutionary theory that suggests religions have evolved from monotheism to polytheism, many cultures actually show vestiges of monotheism early in their development. This suggests that most religions have begun with a belief in one God before devolving into polytheism.

Even within polytheistic religions, there is often a central god who is considered sovereign over the rest. This functional monotheism or henotheism further supports the idea that monotheism is deeply ingrained in human religious beliefs.

### Philosophical Arguments for Monotheism

There are several philosophical arguments that support the belief in one God. One such argument is based on the idea that if there were more than one God, the universe would be in disorder due to multiple creators and authorities. However, since the universe is not in disorder, it follows that there is only one God.

Another argument stems from the concept of God being a completely perfect being. If there were a second God, they would have to differ in some way, which would mean they are less than perfect and not truly God. Therefore, there can only be one completely perfect being.

Additionally, the infinite existence of God poses a challenge to the existence of multiple gods. If God's existence is infinite and cannot be divided into parts, it follows that there cannot be two infinite beings. Therefore, there can only be one infinite God.

### Why This Matters

Understanding monotheism is important because it forms the foundation of many religious beliefs and practices. It provides a framework for understanding the nature of God and our relationship with Him. Monotheism also highlights the uniqueness and supremacy of God, emphasizing His role as the creator and sustainer of all things.

Think About It

Consider how monotheism shapes your understanding of God and your relationship with Him. How does the belief in one true God impact your daily life and decisions? Reflect on how monotheism sets Christianity apart from other religions that may embrace polytheism or henotheism.

Title: Discover the Divine Majesty of God the Father in Christian Faith
---

## God the Father

The concept of the Trinity is a fundamental belief in Christianity. It teaches that there is one God who exists in three distinct Persons: God the Father, God the Son (Jesus Christ), and God the Holy Spirit. While this concept may be difficult to fully comprehend, it is accepted by faith because it is taught in the Bible.

### 1. The Trinity: One God in Three Persons

According to the Bible, there is only one God ([Deuteronomy 6:4](https://www.bibleref.com/Deuteronomy/6/Deuteronomy-6-4.html); [1 Corinthians 8:6](https://www.bibleref.com/1-Corinthians/8/1-Corinthians-8-6.html)). However, this one God exists eternally as three Persons: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit ([Matthew 28:19](https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/28/Matthew-28-19.html); [Luke 3:21](https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/3/Luke-3-21.html)–22; [2 Corinthians 13:14](https://www.bibleref.com/2-Corinthians/13/2-Corinthians-13-14.html)). Each Person of the Trinity is equal and eternal, with no one being inferior to another ([John 1:1](https://www.bibleref.com/John/1/John-1-1.html)–2). They share the same essence and nature. The Athanasian Creed expresses it as "In this Trinity, no one is before or after, greater or less than the other; but all three persons are in themselves, coeternal and coequal; and so we must worship the Trinity in unity and the one God in three persons."

**Why This Matters:** Understanding the nature of God as a triune being deepens our appreciation for His complexity and unity. It also helps us grasp the relational aspect of God's existence, with each Person of the Trinity having a distinct role.

**Think About It:** Just as water can exist as a liquid, solid (ice), or gas (steam) while retaining its essential nature as H2O, so too does God exist as three Persons while remaining one God.

### 2. God the Father: The First Person of the Trinity

God the Father is the first Person of the Trinity and serves as its functional head. While He is an infinite, personal Spirit ([John 4:24](https://www.bibleref.com/John/4/John-4-24.html)), the term "Father" has been used to identify Him from eternity past. He is referred to as "Father" in relation to His Son ([John 3:16](https://www.bibleref.com/John/3/John-3-16.html)–17) and His chosen people ([Exodus 4:22](https://www.bibleref.com/Exodus/4/Exodus-4-22.html)–23; [1 Corinthians 1:3](https://www.bibleref.com/1-Corinthians/1/1-Corinthians-1-3.html)). It is important to note that God the Father is neither male nor female, but Scripture uses masculine pronouns to portray His parental closeness and authoritative role as God. Some passages in the Bible also describe God the Father using feminine imagery, which displays His tender care and concern for His people ([Isaiah 66:13](https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/66/Isaiah-66-13.html); [Matthew 23:37](https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/23/Matthew-23-37.html)).

**Why This Matters:** Recognizing God the Father's character and roles helps us approach Him with reverence, gratitude, and trust. It emphasizes His love for us as His children and His desire for an intimate relationship with us.

**Think About It:** Just as a loving father provides guidance, protection, and provision for his children, so too does God the Father care for His creation and provide for the needs of His children.

### 3. The Functional Head of the Trinity

While God the Father is not superior in essence or being to the Son or the Holy Spirit, He serves as the functional head of the Trinity. Both God the Son and God the Holy Spirit voluntarily submit to Him on a functional level to accomplish the will of God ([John 14:24](https://www.bibleref.com/John/14/John-14-24.html)–26, 20:21). God the Son is eternally begotten by God the Father and is sent from Him alone (John 17), while God the Holy Spirit proceeds from God the Father through the Son ([John 15:26](https://www.bibleref.com/John/15/John-15-26.html)).

**Why This Matters:** Understanding this functional hierarchy within the Trinity helps us comprehend how each Person of the Trinity works together in unity to fulfill their unique roles in creation, redemption, and sanctification.

**Think About It:** Just as a well-coordinated team has a captain who directs the actions of the players, so too does God the Father direct the will of God the Son and God the Holy Spirit to accomplish His purposes.

### 4. The Author of All Divine Acts

As the functional head of the Trinity, God the Father can be understood as the author of all acts of God. He is the one who created the heavens and the earth (Genesis 1-2), and He did this through God the Son by the power of God the Holy Spirit ([Genesis 1:1](https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/1/Genesis-1-1.html)–2; [Colossians 1:16](https://www.bibleref.com/Colossians/1/Colossians-1-16.html)). He is also the source for all other divine acts, including election, calling, salvation, sanctification, glorification, and more. [Romans 11:36](https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/11/Romans-11-36.html) says, "For from Him and through Him and to Him are all things. To Him be the glory forever. Amen" (ESV).

**Why This Matters:** Recognizing God the Father as the ultimate source and authority behind all divine acts helps us trust in His sovereignty, wisdom, and goodness. It reminds us that everything exists for His glory.

**Think About It:** Just as an architect envisions and designs a building, which is then constructed by contractors and brought to completion according to the architect's plans, so too does God the Father author and oversee all divine acts.

### 5. Revealed through Jesus Christ

Through His life and ministry, Jesus frequently taught His followers about who God the Father is and what He is like. The Gospel narratives provide us with a clear picture of God the Father. We learn that God is a Father who deeply loves His children ([John 16:27](https://www.bibleref.com/John/16/John-16-27.html)); He is to be prayed to ([Matthew 6:6](https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/6/Matthew-6-6.html)); He is the source of salvation for all who come through Jesus ([John 14:6](https://www.bibleref.com/John/14/John-14-6.html)); and He has a will that we should seek after ([John 6:38](https://www.bibleref.com/John/6/John-6-38.html)).

**Why This Matters:** Jesus' teachings about God the Father help us understand His character, desires, and intentions. They guide us in our relationship with Him and inform our understanding of the nature of God.

**Think About It:** Just as a child learns about their father's character, desires, and will through their interactions and conversations, so too do we learn about God the Father through Jesus' teachings and our personal relationship with Him.

### Conclusion

Understanding God the Father as the first Person of the Trinity and the functional head of the Godhead provides us with a deeper comprehension of His roles, character, and relationships within the Trinity. While our understanding may be limited, we can trust in His infinite wisdom, love, and sovereignty. Through Jesus Christ, we can experience a personal relationship with God the Father, approaching Him as a loving Father who desires to be intimately involved in our lives. May we seek to know Him more deeply and honor Him in all that we do.

## The Enemy of God: Understanding Opposition to God's Presence and Purposes

As Christians, it is important to understand the concept of an enemy of God. An enemy is someone who dislikes or hates another and seeks to harm, contradict, and fight against them. In the context of our faith, an enemy of God is someone who opposes the presence and purposes of God in this world.

### Satan: The Primary Enemy

The Bible specifically identifies Satan, also known as the devil, as the primary enemy of God ([1 Timothy 5:14](https://www.bibleref.com/1-Timothy/5/1-Timothy-5-14.html)–15). Throughout history, Satan has sought to thwart God’s plan, harm humans, and lead them away from God. He is constantly at work to deceive and manipulate people in order to turn them against God.

### Other Enemies of God

In addition to Satan, Scripture mentions many other enemies of God and His people. They are often referred to as adversaries or foes. Any person who disobeys the Lord’s commands becomes an enemy of God. Sin sets us against God, as we read in [Colossians 1:21](https://www.bibleref.com/Colossians/1/Colossians-1-21.html): “Once you were alienated from God and were enemies in your minds because of your evil behavior.”

The apostle Paul also referred to unsaved sinners as enemies of God in [Romans 5:10](https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/5/Romans-5-10.html), NLT: “For since our friendship with God was restored by the death of his Son while we were still his enemies, we will certainly be saved through the life of his Son.”

### Historical Enemies of God's People

Throughout Israel’s history, the people of God had to contend with enemies committed to their destruction. The Egyptians, Canaanites, Philistines, and Babylonians are just a few examples of cruel and oppressive enemy nations featured in the Old Testament. These nations opposed God’s people and were counted as enemies of God. However, whenever God's people faced such enemies, He fought on their behalf (2 Kings 19).

### Jesus Christ and His Enemies

Jesus Christ, throughout His life, faced opposition from both human and spiritual enemies. This was foretold in [Genesis 3:15](https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/3/Genesis-3-15.html). Herod the Great, for instance, tried to have the infant Jesus killed, but he failed ([Matthew 2:13](https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/2/Matthew-2-13.html), 16–20). Satan himself tempted Jesus in the wilderness ([Mark 1:12](https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/1/Mark-1-12.html)–13). At times, Satan opposed the Lord through His friends and followers. For example, Peter tried to discourage Jesus from fulfilling His mission ([Matthew 16:22](https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/16/Matthew-16-22.html)–23). The Jewish leaders also plotted to kill Jesus as predicted in Old Testament Scripture ([Psalm 2:2](https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/2/Psalm-2-2.html); [Isaiah 53:3](https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/53/Isaiah-53-3.html)).

Ultimately, Jesus' enemies succeeded in executing Him ([Matthew 27:22](https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/27/Matthew-27-22.html); [Acts 2:23](https://www.bibleref.com/Acts/2/Acts-2-23.html)), but they were unsuccessful in thwarting God’s plan. Jesus overcame every enemy, including death itself, through His resurrection ([Matthew 22:44](https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/22/Matthew-22-44.html); [Philippians 2:9](https://www.bibleref.com/Philippians/2/Philippians-2-9.html)–11). In doing so, He secured victory for His followers.

### Christians and Their Enemies

Jesus Christ made it clear that Christians would face many enemies because of their faith in Him. In [2 Timothy 3:12](https://www.bibleref.com/2-Timothy/3/2-Timothy-3-12.html), we read, “In fact, everyone who wants to live a godly life in Christ Jesus will be persecuted.” Christians can expect opposition and persecution due to their allegiance to God.

However, Christ also provided an example for Christians to follow when facing enemies of God and their threats. In [1 Peter 2:21](https://www.bibleref.com/1-Peter/2/1-Peter-2-21.html)–24, we are instructed to follow in His steps by not retaliating or making threats. We are called to entrust ourselves to God who judges justly. Through His sacrifice on the cross, Jesus bore our sins so that we might die to sin and live for righteousness.

### Remaining Vigilant

The Bible instructs believers to be cautious yet courageous when dealing with the enemies of God. In [1 Peter 5:8](https://www.bibleref.com/1-Peter/5/1-Peter-5-8.html), we are warned to be sober-minded and watchful, as the devil prowls around like a roaring lion, seeking someone to devour. We need to remain vigilant and stand firm in our faith, knowing that God is ultimately in control.

### The Defeat of God's Enemies

The enemies of God are fighting a losing battle. [Psalm 92:9](https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/92/Psalm-92-9.html) declares, “Surely your enemies, Lord, surely your enemies will perish; all evildoers will be scattered.” God's victory is assured, and His enemies will ultimately be defeated.

Finally, the last enemy of God to be eradicated is death itself. In [1 Corinthians 15:25](https://www.bibleref.com/1-Corinthians/15/1-Corinthians-15-25.html)–26, we read, “For he must reign until he has put all his enemies under his feet. The last enemy to be destroyed is death.” This truth is further emphasized in [2 Timothy 1:10](https://www.bibleref.com/2-Timothy/1/2-Timothy-1-10.html) and [Revelation 21:4](https://www.bibleref.com/Revelation/21/Revelation-21-4.html).

## Why This Matters

Understanding the concept of an enemy of God helps us navigate the challenges and opposition we may face as Christians. It reminds us that we are engaged in a spiritual battle and need to remain steadfast in our faith. By recognizing the tactics of the enemy and relying on God's strength, we can overcome obstacles and continue to fulfill God's purposes for our lives.

## Think About It

1. How does knowing that Satan is the primary enemy of God affect your perception of spiritual warfare?
2. In what ways have you personally faced opposition or persecution because of your faith? How did you respond?
3. How can you apply the example of Jesus' response to His enemies in your own life when facing opposition?
4. Reflect on the assurance that God will ultimately defeat all His enemies. How does this give you hope and confidence as a believer?

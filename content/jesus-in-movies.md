Title: Top 10 Inspiring Jesus Movies Every Christian Must Watch
---

## Jesus in Movies

Numerous movies and television programs have portrayed Jesus, but not all of these portrayals are accurate. Some are deliberately blasphemous, while others are well-meaning attempts to represent Christ and His earthly life. However, it is important to examine whether these depictions are biblical and allowed.

### The Second Commandment

Some Christians claim that any representation of Jesus on film breaks the second commandment which states, "You shall not make for yourself an image in the form of anything in heaven above or on the earth beneath or in the waters below" ([Exodus 20:4](https://www.bibleref.com/Exodus/20/Exodus-20-4.html)). However, it is crucial to understand that this commandment prohibits actual idolatry and images intended for improper worship ([Exodus 20:5](https://www.bibleref.com/Exodus/20/Exodus-20-5.html)). It does not condemn every form of visual representation.

The key term in the second commandment is "pecel," which refers to an object specifically intended for worship: an idol ([Exodus 20:4](https://www.bibleref.com/Exodus/20/Exodus-20-4.html)). When this term appears elsewhere in the Bible, it is always connected to idolatry and improper worship. Therefore, the commandment does not prohibit all artistic representations of Jesus.

### Concerns with Portraying Jesus on Film

While artistic representations of Jesus are not inherently sinful, portraying Him on film introduces concerns. Movies and television have a powerful influence on our perception and can shape our understanding of Jesus if we are not careful. Details from these media can become assumptions, traditions, and even dogmas. Many modern expectations about Jesus are driven by His depiction in works of art, leading some people to be offended when Jesus is not visualized in a stereotypical fashion.

However, it is important to recognize that misconceptions about Jesus can occur through means other than cinema. He can also be misrepresented in print, static art, preaching, and conversation. The Bible does not forbid all artistic depictions of Jesus. Since the Bible provides limited details about His fully human life, we are free to use our "sanctified imagination" to speculate. Films of actors portraying Christ are not sinful in themselves. If a specific portrayal is deeply and profanely wrong, the sin lies in the blasphemy, not in the image itself.

### Why This Matters

Understanding the nuances of depicting Jesus on film is important because it affects our perception of Him and can shape our beliefs. Movies and television have a significant impact on how we understand and relate to Jesus, as well as how we perceive His character and teachings. It is crucial to approach these portrayals with discernment and remain grounded in biblical truth.

### Think About It

1. How does your understanding of Jesus' portrayal in movies affect your perception of Him?
2. Are there any specific movies or portrayals of Jesus that have influenced your beliefs or understanding of Him?
3. How can you ensure that your understanding of Jesus remains rooted in biblical truth despite various portrayals in media?

In conclusion, while artistic representations of Jesus on film are not inherently sinful, it is essential to approach them with discernment. The second commandment does not prohibit all artistic depictions of Jesus, as its focus is on objects intended for worship and idolatry. However, movies and television can shape our perception of Jesus if we are not careful. It is important to rely on biblical truth and utilize sanctified imagination when engaging with portrayals of Jesus. By doing so, we can ensure that our understanding of Him remains grounded in His word.

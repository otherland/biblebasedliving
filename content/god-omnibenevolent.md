Title: 'Divine Love Unveiled: Understanding God''s Omnibenevolence'
---

## God: The Omnibenevolent Being

When we talk about God being omnibenevolent, we are referring to the belief that God is completely and perfectly good in every aspect of His being. The term "omnibenevolent" stems from the Latin words "omni," meaning "all," and "benevolent," meaning "good" or "charitable." Essentially, it means that God is all-good, and there is no part of Him that is not purely good. While human beings can do good things, only God is truly omnibenevolent.

### The Perfection of God's Goodness

To understand omnibenevolence fully, we must also consider God's other attributes, such as His omniscience (all-knowing) and omnipotence (all-powerful). If God is a perfect being who is completely self-sustaining and independent of any need, then He must also be perfectly good. If God were merely a good and powerful being but not entirely good, it would imply an element of contingency. In other words, we could conceive of a being with potentially greater benevolence, making that being greater than God Himself. Since the goodness of anything is measured by its perfection, God must be perfectly good to be considered omniscient and omnipotent.

### The Problem of Evil

One common objection to the concept of God's omnibenevolence, along with His omnipotence and omniscience, is the problem of evil. How can there be evil in the world if God is all-knowing, all-powerful, and perfectly good? This question has been debated by philosophers for centuries. Some propose that evil originated from Lucifer's rebellion and subsequently from humanity's free will choices. They argue that evil was not caused by God but rather by the misuse of free will. However, this raises another question: Why did God create beings capable of choosing evil? The answer often provided is that God desired beings who could make choices, as He did not want to create mere robots.

### The Bible and God's Goodness

When we examine the Bible, it consistently presents God as wholly good. Jesus Himself proclaimed that no one is truly good except God ([Mark 10:18](https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/10/Mark-10-18.html)). Numerous testimonies in Scripture affirm God's goodness ([Psalm 106:1](https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/106/Psalm-106-1.html); 135:3; [Nahum 1:7](https://www.bibleref.com/Nahum/1/Nahum-1-7.html)). The message of salvation through Christ is described as "good news" ([Luke 2:10](https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/2/Luke-2-10.html)), and the revelation of Christ is referred to as "the goodness and loving kindness of God our Savior" ([Titus 3:4](https://www.bibleref.com/Titus/3/Titus-3-4.html), ESV). In fact, it is God's goodness that leads us to repentance ([Romans 2:4](https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/2/Romans-2-4.html)). The indwelling Spirit of God produces goodness in our lives ([Galatians 5:22](https://www.bibleref.com/Galatians/5/Galatians-5-22.html)), and God brings goodness to fruition in our lives through faith ([2 Thessalonians 1:11](https://www.bibleref.com/2-Thessalonians/1/2-Thessalonians-1-11.html)).

### Why This Matters

Understanding God's omnibenevolence has significant implications for our relationship with Him. It assures us that every aspect of His being is characterized by perfect goodness. This means that we can trust Him completely, knowing that His intentions and actions toward us are always motivated by love and goodness. Recognizing God's omnibenevolence also helps us navigate the problem of evil, as we can have confidence that He is not the author of evil but rather the source of all goodness.

### Think About It

Consider the implications of a God who is not omnibenevolent. Would you feel comfortable placing your trust in a being who had the potential to be more benevolent than they currently are? How does the concept of God's omnibenevolence impact your understanding of His character? Take time to reflect on how this attribute of God's goodness influences your relationship with Him and your perspective on the problem of evil.

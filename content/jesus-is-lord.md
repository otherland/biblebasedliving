Title: 'Jesus is Lord: Embracing the Ultimate Authority in Christian Faith'
---

## Jesus is Lord

### Introduction

In Christianity, the title "Lord" refers to someone who has authority, control, or power over others. It is a way of acknowledging someone as a master or ruler. In the time of Jesus, the term "Lord" was often used as a sign of respect towards earthly authorities. For example, when a leper called Jesus "Lord," it was an expression of respect for Him as a healer and teacher ([Matthew 8:2](https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/8/Matthew-8-2.html)). However, after Jesus' resurrection, the title "Lord" took on a deeper meaning. It became a declaration of Jesus' deity, affirming that He is God.

### The Deity of Jesus

The proclamation that "Jesus is Lord" signifies that Jesus is God. This understanding began with Thomas' exclamation when he saw the resurrected Jesus: "My Lord and my God!" ([John 20:28](https://www.bibleref.com/John/20/John-20-28.html)). From then on, the apostles preached that Jesus is Lord, meaning that He is God. In Peter's sermon on the Day of Pentecost, he declared that God had made Jesus, whom they crucified, both Lord and Messiah ([Acts 2:36](https://www.bibleref.com/Acts/2/Acts-2-36.html)). Peter also proclaimed in Cornelius's house that Jesus is "Lord of all" ([Acts 10:36](https://www.bibleref.com/Acts/10/Acts-10-36.html)). The confession of "Jesus is Lord" is linked to His resurrection in [Romans 10:9](https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/10/Romans-10-9.html), emphasizing the significance of His lordship.

### Jesus' Authority and Sovereignty

When we say "Jesus is Lord," we acknowledge that Jesus has complete authority and power over all things. He is described as having "all authority in heaven and on earth" ([Matthew 28:18](https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/28/Matthew-28-18.html)). Jesus also claimed to be Lord numerous times during His earthly ministry ([Luke 19:31](https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/19/Luke-19-31.html); [John 13:13](https://www.bibleref.com/John/13/John-13-13.html)). Furthermore, the New Testament equates the "LORD" mentioned in the Old Testament with the "Lord Jesus." For example, [Psalm 34:8](https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/34/Psalm-34-8.html) says, "Taste and see that the LORD is good," and in [1 Peter 2:3](https://www.bibleref.com/1-Peter/2/1-Peter-2-3.html), Jesus is referred to as the "Lord" who is good. This identification highlights Jesus' divine nature and His role as the ultimate authority.

### The Humility of Jesus

Despite His status as Lord and God, Jesus demonstrated humility during His time on earth. Through His Incarnation, He revealed the true meaning of meekness ([Matthew 11:29](https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/11/Matthew-11-29.html)). Just before His arrest, Jesus used His authority to teach the disciples about humility by washing their feet ([John 13:14](https://www.bibleref.com/John/13/John-13-14.html)). He taught that the last would be first in His kingdom ([Matthew 19:30](https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/19/Matthew-19-30.html)). By exemplifying humility, Jesus showed that true lordship involves serving others rather than seeking power or control.

### Submission to Jesus' Authority

To declare "Jesus is Lord" implies a commitment to obey Him. Jesus questioned why people called Him "Lord, Lord" but did not do what He said ([Luke 6:46](https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/6/Luke-6-46.html)). Acknowledging Jesus' lordship logically leads to submitting to His authority. If Jesus is Lord, then He has ownership over our lives and has the right to guide and direct us. This submission to Jesus' authority is an essential aspect of being a follower of Christ.

### The Significance of Believing in Jesus as Lord

Saying "Jesus is Lord" goes beyond mere words; it requires a genuine belief in the heart. The apostle Paul states that no one can truly say "Jesus is Lord" except by the Holy Spirit ([1 Corinthians 12:3](https://www.bibleref.com/1-Corinthians/12/1-Corinthians-12-3.html)). Faith in the Lord Jesus is necessary for salvation ([Acts 16:31](https://www.bibleref.com/Acts/16/Acts-16-31.html)). When we acknowledge Jesus as Lord and Savior, we recognize His divinity and surrender our lives to Him. It is through this confession that we receive salvation and enter into a relationship with God.

### Conclusion

Jesus is Lord, which means He is God and has supreme authority over all things. This truth is foundational in Christianity and has significant implications for believers. It requires acknowledging Jesus' deity, submitting to His authority, and living a life that reflects His teachings. As Christians, we are called to proclaim and live out the truth that Jesus is Lord. One day, every knee will bow and every tongue will acknowledge that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father ([Philippians 2:9](https://www.bibleref.com/Philippians/2/Philippians-2-9.html)â€“11).

**Why This Matters**

Understanding the lordship of Jesus is crucial for our faith. It shapes our view of God's authority, our relationship with Jesus, and how we live our lives as His followers. Recognizing Jesus as Lord impacts our worship, obedience, and service to Him. It is a foundational truth that leads us to salvation and transformation in Christ.

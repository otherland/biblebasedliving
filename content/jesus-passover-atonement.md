Title: 'Jesus'' Ultimate Passover Atonement: Revealing the Divine Sacrifice'
---

## Jesus' Passover Atonement

The Passover sacrifice in the Old Testament was a significant event that typified Jesus Christ as the Lamb of God. The paschal lamb, which had to be a male without spot or blemish, represented Jesus perfectly. Just as the Israelites applied the blood of the sacrifice in faith, we also apply the spotless blood of Christ to our hearts. In this way, "Christ our Passover has been sacrificed for us" ([1 Corinthians 5:7](https://www.bibleref.com/1-Corinthians/5/1-Corinthians-5-7.html)).

### The Symbolism of Yom Kippur

Some object to considering Jesus' sacrifice at Passover as an atonement because they believe atonement was provided through the sacrifices on Yom Kippur (the Day of Atonement). However, there are two ways to counter this objection.

Firstly, Jesus fulfilled the symbolism of Yom Kippur as well. He bore our sins in His own body ([1 Peter 2:24](https://www.bibleref.com/1-Peter/2/1-Peter-2-24.html)) and tasted death for everyone ([Hebrews 2:9](https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/2/Hebrews-2-9.html)). His sacrifice was better than those offered on Yom Kippur because it was permanent, voluntary, and removed sin entirely ([Hebrews 9:8-14](https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/9/Hebrews-9-8.html)).

Secondly, Jewish tradition does view the Passover sacrifice as expiatory, meaning it removes sin from God's view. The lamb died under God's outpoured wrath, covering over the sins of the one offering it. This is supported by the medieval Jewish commentator Rashi, who stated that the Paschal blood propitiated and atoned for individuals (Ex. R. 15, 35b, 35a).

### The Saving Power of the Passover Sacrifice

During the tenth and final plague in Egypt, the Passover sacrifice saved individuals from death ([Exodus 12:23](https://www.bibleref.com/Exodus/12/Exodus-12-23.html)). Based on the redemptive offering of the Passover blood, the firstborn were spared. This event can be compared to a king who sets aside indictments against his sons when they present him with a gift before facing his judgment seat. Similarly, God atoned for the Israelites' sins because of their participation in the Passover (Ex. R. 15.12, on Exodus 12.10).

The Passover lambs brought atonement to the believing Jewish households on that significant night of judgment and redemption. The mark of blood acted as an atonement for those within the house who partook of the paschal offering and also served as a sign for the destroying angel to pass by the house (Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra, pg. 388).

### Jesus: The Lamb of God

When John the Baptist saw Jesus, he declared, "Look, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!" ([John 1:29](https://www.bibleref.com/John/1/John-1-29.html)). Jesus is referred to as the "Passover lamb" because, like the paschal lamb, He was silent before His accusers ([Isaiah 53:7](https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/53/Isaiah-53-7.html)). In His death, Jesus bore the wrath of God, preserved the lives of all who trust in Him, and granted freedom to those enslaved by sin.

### Why This Matters

Understanding Jesus' fulfillment of the Passover sacrifice and His role as the Lamb of God helps us grasp the depth and significance of His sacrifice on the cross. It reinforces our faith in Jesus as our Savior and reminds us that salvation is possible through Him alone. Recognizing this biblical truth enables us to appreciate the Old Testament foreshadowing of Christ's redemptive work and strengthens our relationship with God.

### Think About It

Consider how Jesus' sacrifice as our Passover lamb impacts your understanding of salvation. How does this knowledge deepen your gratitude towards Him? Reflect on how Jesus' fulfillment of Old Testament symbolism strengthens your faith in Him as the promised Messiah. Take a moment to thank God for sending Jesus as the perfect sacrifice for your sins.

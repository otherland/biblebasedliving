## The Presence of God

The presence of God is a topic that holds great significance in the Christian faith. In the beginning, Adam and Eve experienced intimate fellowship with God in the Garden of Eden ([Genesis 3:8](https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/3/Genesis-3-8.html)). However, sin entered the world and hindered our ability to be in the physical presence of God ([Exodus 33:20](https://www.bibleref.com/Exodus/33/Exodus-33-20.html)). As a result, only the holy and sinless angels are now in His physical presence ([Luke 1:19](https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/1/Luke-1-19.html)). Yet, as Christians, we have the privilege of experiencing the presence of God within us through the indwelling Holy Spirit ([John 14:23](https://www.bibleref.com/John/14/John-14-23.html); 15:4). This indwelling presence is made possible through our faith in the Lord Jesus Christ.

### The Indwelling Presence of God

The presence of God within us is a reality that we become aware of through our obedience to His Word. As believers, we are chosen by God and belong to Him ([1 Peter 2:9](https://www.bibleref.com/1-Peter/2/1-Peter-2-9.html)). Therefore, it is only natural that He would be present among us. It is important to note that while we may anger God through our sin, true believers never lose the presence of the Holy Spirit. We may, however, lose the "sense" of His presence from time to time. Just as a landlord temporarily leaves his house but leaves his belongings behind, so too does God's presence remain with us even when we feel distant from Him.

### The Joy of God's Presence

The practical result of being in God's presence is joy. Unfortunately, many Christians appear gloomy and dejected due to a lack of this sense of God's presence. However, for those who walk with the Lord in obedience and faith, fellowship with Him is sweet. This sweet fellowship sustains us, especially during trials, for "the joy of the Lord shall be your strength" ([Nehemiah 8:10](https://www.bibleref.com/Nehemiah/8/Nehemiah-8-10.html)). Trials and difficulties serve to refine our faith and develop perseverance. As we persevere through these challenges, our sense of God's presence increases, along with our joy.

### Why This Matters

Understanding the presence of God is essential to our Christian walk. It reminds us that we are not alone but rather have the indwelling Holy Spirit guiding and empowering us. Knowing that God is always present with us can bring comfort and assurance, even in the midst of trials. It also encourages us to seek obedience, trusting that as we do, our sense of His presence will grow, leading to greater joy in our lives.

### Think About It

1. How does knowing that God is always present with you impact your daily life?
2. Have you ever experienced a time when you felt distant from God's presence? How did you regain a sense of His nearness?
3. Reflect on a difficult situation you have faced. Did your sense of God's presence increase or decrease during that time? How did it impact your faith and perseverance?

In conclusion, the presence of God is a reality that Christians experience through the indwelling Holy Spirit. Though sin has separated us from God's physical presence, we can still enjoy fellowship with Him by walking in obedience and faith. The joy that comes from being in God's presence sustains us through trials and strengthens our faith. Remembering that God is always present with us can bring comfort, assurance, and a greater sense of joy in our lives.

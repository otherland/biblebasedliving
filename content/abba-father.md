## Abba Father

In Scripture, there are many different names used to describe God. One of the most significant names is "Abba Father." The word "Abba" is an Aramaic word that means "Father." It signifies the close, intimate relationship between a father and his child, as well as the childlike trust that a young child puts in their "daddy." The term "Abba Father" is found in three passages of the Bible: [Mark 14:36](https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/14/Mark-14-36.html), [Romans 8:15](https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/8/Romans-8-15.html), and [Galatians 4:6](https://www.bibleref.com/Galatians/4/Galatians-4-6.html).

### What does "Abba Father" mean?

The phrase "Abba Father" doubly emphasizes the fatherhood of God. It assures us of God's care for His children and signifies a special relationship with Him. When we become born-again Christians, we are adopted into the family of God and can call Him our "Father" ([John 1:12-13](https://www.bibleref.com/John/1/John-1-12.html)). This adoption makes us heirs with Christ and allows us to approach God with boldness and full assurance of faith ([Romans 8:16-17](https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/8/Romans-8-16.html); [Hebrews 10:19](https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/10/Hebrews-10-19.html), 22).

### Our relationship with God as His children

Being able to call God our "Father" is life-changing. It means that He no longer deals with us as enemies but as family. The Holy Spirit testifies with our spirit that we are God's children ([Romans 8:16](https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/8/Romans-8-16.html)). We have a new relationship with Him and a new standing before Him. Instead of running from God and trying to hide our sin, we can run to Him, calling out "Abba, Father!" and finding forgiveness in Christ.

As children of God, we are called to live a life worthy of our calling ([Ephesians 4:1](https://www.bibleref.com/Ephesians/4/Ephesians-4-1.html)). Our adoption into God's family gives us hope, security for the future, and an eternal inheritance that can never perish, spoil, or fade ([1 Peter 1:4](https://www.bibleref.com/1-Peter/1/1-Peter-1-4.html)). It also calls us to a higher standard and a different way of life.

### Why This Matters

Understanding the significance of calling God "Abba Father" helps us comprehend the depth of our relationship with Him. It reminds us that we are not just servants or creations of God but His beloved children. The term "Abba Father" reflects the intimate, loving, and trustworthy nature of our Heavenly Father.

By embracing this truth, we can approach God with confidence and find comfort in His care for us. It also motivates us to live lives that honor Him and reflect His character. Recognizing ourselves as children of God encourages us to seek His guidance, trust in His provision, and find solace in His love.

### Think About It

Reflect on your relationship with God. Do you truly see Him as your loving Father? How does understanding God as "Abba Father" impact your perspective on prayer, worship, and daily living? Take time to thank God for adopting you into His family and ask Him to deepen your understanding of what it means to be His child.

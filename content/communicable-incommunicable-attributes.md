## Communicable and Incommunicable Attributes of God

The attributes of God can be divided into two categories: communicable and incommunicable. Communicable attributes are those that humans can also possess, although only to a finite extent. Incommunicable attributes, on the other hand, are exclusive to God and cannot be shared with His creatures.

### Communicable Attributes

1. **Love**: God is love, and humans can also love, although imperfectly. Our ability to love is derived from God's love for us.

2. **Justice**: While humans have a sense of justice and can carry out justice, we do so imperfectly. God, however, is perfectly just.

3. **Creativity**: God is the Creator, and while humans are creative, we cannot create ex nihilo (out of nothing) as God can.

4. **Grace and Mercy**: God extends grace and mercy towards us, and as we grow in Christ and are transformed by the Holy Spirit, we can also exhibit these attributes in a more meaningful and perfected sense.

5. **Goodness**: God is inherently good, and we are called to reflect His goodness in our lives.

6. **Truthfulness**: God is the source of all truth, and as followers of Christ, we are called to live in truthfulness.

7. **Rational Thought**: Humans have been created in the image of God, which includes the capacity for rational thought and reasoning.

8. **Relationality**: God exists in perfect relationship within the Trinity, and we are created for relationship with Him and with others.

### Why This Matters

Understanding the communicable attributes of God helps us to realize that as His image-bearers, we have been designed to reflect His character in our lives. It also highlights our need for the transforming work of the Holy Spirit to help us grow in these attributes and become more like Christ.

### Think About It

- How can you grow in exhibiting the communicable attributes of God in your own life? 
- In what ways do you see these attributes reflected in the lives of other believers?

### Incommunicable Attributes

1. **Omnipotence**: God is all-powerful, and His power is beyond human comprehension. We can define this attribute, but we cannot fully comprehend or possess it.

2. **Immutable**: God is unchanging, while humans are subject to change and growth.

3. **Self-Existence**: God exists independently of anything else, whereas humans are dependent on Him for our existence.

### Why This Matters

Recognizing and honoring the incommunicable attributes of God reminds us of His uniqueness and greatness. It calls us to revere, worship, trust, and praise the Creator who possesses these attributes that are beyond our comprehension.

### Think About It

- How does recognizing God's omnipotence, immutability, and self-existence impact your understanding of who He is?
- How can focusing on these incommunicable attributes deepen your awe and reverence for God?

In conclusion, the communicable attributes of God are those that humans can possess to a finite extent. These include love, justice, creativity, grace, mercy, goodness, truthfulness, rational thought, and relationality. As we grow in Christ and are transformed by the Holy Spirit, we can exhibit these attributes more meaningfully. On the other hand, the incommunicable attributes of God are exclusive to Him and include omnipotence, immutability, and self-existence. Recognizing both sets of attributes helps us understand our relationship with God and our purpose as His image-bearers. Let us strive to reflect His communicable attributes while acknowledging and revering His incommunicable attributes.

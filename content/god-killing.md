## God's Actions in the Old Testament

God's actions in the Old Testament, specifically instances where He is recorded as killing multitudes of people, have led to some misconceptions and questions about His character. It is important to note that the English translation of the sixth commandment in the King James Version, which reads "Thou shalt not kill" ([Exodus 20:13](https://www.bibleref.com/Exodus/20/Exodus-20-13.html)), has contributed to this confusion. However, the original Hebrew word, "ratsach," is more accurately translated as "murder" rather than "kill." Modern translations render the command as "You shall not murder." The Bible in Basic English conveys its meaning as "Do not put anyone to death without cause."

It is true that God intentionally killed many people throughout history. However, it is crucial to differentiate between killing and murder. Murder refers to the premeditated and unlawful taking of a life, while killing encompasses a broader scope of taking a life. The same Law that forbids murder permits killing in self-defense ([Exodus 22:2](https://www.bibleref.com/Exodus/22/Exodus-22-2.html)).

In order for God to commit murder, He would have to act unlawfully. It is important to recognize that God is God — His works are perfect, all His ways are just, and He does no wrong ([Deuteronomy 32:4](https://www.bibleref.com/Deuteronomy/32/Deuteronomy-32-4.html)). When humanity disobeys God, they face His wrath ([Exodus 19:5](https://www.bibleref.com/Exodus/19/Exodus-19-5.html); [Exodus 23:21-22](https://www.bibleref.com/Exodus/23/Exodus-23-21.html); [Leviticus 26:14-18](https://www.bibleref.com/Leviticus/26/Leviticus-26-14.html)). Additionally, God is described as a just judge who is angry with the wicked every day ([Psalm 7:11-12](https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/7/Psalm-7-11.html)).

Some argue that executing the innocent constitutes murder. However, from a biblical perspective, there are no truly innocent people compared to God's holiness. All have sinned ([Romans 3:23](https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/3/Romans-3-23.html)), and the penalty for sin is death (Romans 6:23a). God has just cause to wipe out humanity, but His mercy spares us from complete destruction.

## God's Actions in the Old Testament: Examples

Throughout the Old Testament, there are specific instances where God chose to bring about death and destruction. Let's explore some of these examples to gain a better understanding:

### The Flood

One of the most well-known instances is the story of the Great Flood, where God decided to destroy all living creatures except for Noah, his family, and the animals on the ark ([Genesis 7:21-23](https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/7/Genesis-7-21.html); [1 Peter 3:20](https://www.bibleref.com/1-Peter/3/1-Peter-3-20.html)). God's decision to wipe out humanity was justified by the wickedness that had consumed the earth. The Bible states, "Then the LORD saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth and that every intent of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually" ([Genesis 6:5](https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/6/Genesis-6-5.html)).

### The Conquest of Canaan

During the conquest of Canaan by the Israelites, God commanded them to destroy entire cities and nations, leaving nothing alive ([Deuteronomy 20:16-17](https://www.bibleref.com/Deuteronomy/20/Deuteronomy-20-16.html)). This command was given because the Canaanites were engaged in abominable practices, including burning their own children as sacrifices to their gods ([Deuteronomy 12:31](https://www.bibleref.com/Deuteronomy/12/Deuteronomy-12-31.html)). God used Israel as an instrument of judgment against these evil practices and wanted to prevent Israel from following in their footsteps ([Deuteronomy 20:18](https://www.bibleref.com/Deuteronomy/20/Deuteronomy-20-18.html)).

### God's Mercy Amidst Judgment

Even in these dire judgments, God offered mercy. For example, before destroying Sodom and Gomorrah, God promised Abraham that He would spare the whole city if just ten righteous people could be found there. Although ten righteous individuals were not found, God saved "righteous Lot" and his family ([Genesis 18:32](https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/18/Genesis-18-32.html); [Genesis 19:15](https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/19/Genesis-19-15.html); [2 Peter 2:7](https://www.bibleref.com/2-Peter/2/2-Peter-2-7.html)). Similarly, during the destruction of Jericho, God spared Rahab the harlot and her family because of her faith ([Joshua 6:25](https://www.bibleref.com/Joshua/6/Joshua-6-25.html); [Hebrews 11:31](https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/11/Hebrews-11-31.html)). These instances demonstrate that, even in judgment, God extends mercy to those who trust in Him.

It can be challenging to understand why God would order such devastating actions. However, it is important to approach these events from a biblical perspective and consider some key points:

### God's Holiness and Justice

God is holy and just, and He cannot tolerate sin or evil. His actions are ultimately motivated by His perfect nature. When confronted with unrepentant wickedness, God's justice demands a response. The destruction He brings upon sinful nations and individuals is a reflection of His righteousness.

### Human Sinfulness

From a biblical standpoint, every person is tainted by sin. Compared to God's holiness, there are no truly innocent individuals. All have fallen short of God's standards ([Romans 3:23](https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/3/Romans-3-23.html)). Therefore, when God executes judgment on humanity, it is not an act of murder but rather a just response to sin.

### God's Mercy

Despite the judgments recorded in the Old Testament, God consistently displays mercy. He offers opportunities for repentance and salvation. The examples of Lot and Rahab show that God is willing to spare those who exhibit faith in Him. It is through His mercy that anyone can find forgiveness and salvation.

### The Final Judgment

It is essential to remember that the judgments depicted in the Old Testament are not the final word. Each person will face their own judgment when they die ([Hebrews 9:27](https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/9/Hebrews-9-27.html)). God, as a just judge, holds the unrighteous accountable for their actions ([2 Peter 2:9](https://www.bibleref.com/2-Peter/2/2-Peter-2-9.html)). However, He has also provided a way for salvation through Jesus Christ (Romans 6:23b). In Christ, believers can receive the gift of eternal life.

## Why This Matters

Understanding God's actions in the Old Testament is crucial for believers. It allows them to grasp the depth of God's holiness, justice, and mercy. Recognizing God's righteousness in executing judgment helps us appreciate His perfect nature and understand the consequences of sin. Additionally, comprehending His mercy in offering salvation through faith in Jesus Christ allows believers to embrace the hope and assurance of eternal life.

## Think About It

Reflecting on God's actions in the Old Testament prompts several important questions:

1. How does understanding God's justice and holiness impact your view of sin?
2. How does recognizing God's mercy influence your perception of His character?
3. In what ways can you demonstrate gratitude for God's gift of salvation through Jesus Christ?
4. How can a deeper understanding of God's actions in the Old Testament strengthen your faith?

Take time to ponder these questions and seek a deeper understanding of God's nature through prayer, study, and reflection on His Word.

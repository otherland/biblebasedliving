## Angry with God

When something tragic happens in our lives, it is natural for us to ask God, "Why?" We may find ourselves angry with God, questioning why He allowed the tragedy to occur. This anger stems from two flawed ways of thinking. First, we may believe that life should be easy and that God should prevent unpleasant circumstances from happening to us. When He doesn't, we get angry with Him. Second, when we don't fully comprehend God's sovereignty, we lose confidence in His ability to control everything, including the events that impact our lives. This lack of understanding can lead to frustration and anger toward God. However, it's important to remember that our anger at God is often rooted in our own human limitations and desire for control.

Tragedies serve as a reminder that we are not in control. As much as we may try to influence outcomes, it is ultimately God who is in charge of His creation. Every event that occurs is either caused or allowed by God. Even the smallest details do not escape His notice ([Matthew 10:29-31](https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/10/Matthew-10-29.html)). While we may complain and get angry, blaming God for our circumstances, it is important to trust Him and surrender our bitterness and pain to Him. Acknowledging our own prideful desire to impose our will over His can grant us His peace and strength to navigate through difficult situations ([1 Corinthians 10:13](https://www.bibleref.com/1-Corinthians/10/1-Corinthians-10-13.html)).

Our understanding of God's sovereignty must be accompanied by an understanding of His other attributes such as love, mercy, kindness, goodness, righteousness, justice, and holiness. When we view our difficulties through the lens of God's Word, we begin to see them in a different light. Scripture assures us that our loving and holy God works all things together for our good ([Romans 8:28](https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/8/Romans-8-28.html)). He has a perfect plan and purpose for us that cannot be thwarted ([Isaiah 14:24](https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/14/Isaiah-14-24.html), 46:9-10). It is essential to recognize that this life is not meant to be devoid of trouble. Job reminds us that "man is born to trouble as surely as sparks fly upward" ([Job 5:7](https://www.bibleref.com/Job/5/Job-5-7.html)), and that life is short and "full of trouble" ([Job 14:1](https://www.bibleref.com/Job/14/Job-14-1.html)). Following Christ does not guarantee a life free from problems. In fact, Jesus Himself said, "In this world you will have trouble," but He also reassured us that He has "overcome the world" ([John 16:33](https://www.bibleref.com/John/16/John-16-33.html)). Through Him, we can find peace amidst the storms of life ([John 14:27](https://www.bibleref.com/John/14/John-14-27.html)).

It is important to note that inappropriate anger is sinful ([Galatians 5:20](https://www.bibleref.com/Galatians/5/Galatians-5-20.html); [Ephesians 4:26-27](https://www.bibleref.com/Ephesians/4/Ephesians-4-26.html), 31; [Colossians 3:8](https://www.bibleref.com/Colossians/3/Colossians-3-8.html)). Ungodly anger can be self-destructive, give the devil a foothold in our lives, and rob us of joy and peace. Holding onto anger can breed bitterness and resentment in our hearts. Instead, we must confess our anger to the Lord and release it to Him. It is crucial to approach God in prayer during times of grief, anger, and pain. David serves as an example in [2 Samuel 12:15-23](https://www.bibleref.com/2-Samuel/12/2-Samuel-12-15.html) when he fervently prayed for his sick baby's survival. Even when the baby passed away, David worshiped the Lord and proclaimed that he would someday be reunited with his child in God's presence. David cried out to God during his baby's illness and worshiped Him afterward. This demonstrates the importance of pouring out our hearts to God and being honest about our feelings. He knows our hearts, so there is no need to hide anything from Him. By expressing ourselves humbly before Him, we allow Him to work through us and shape us into His likeness.

Ultimately, we must ask ourselves if we can trust God with everything, including our lives and the lives of our loved ones. The answer is a resounding yes! Our God is compassionate, full of grace and love. As disciples of Christ, we can trust Him with all things. When tragedies occur, we can trust that God can use them to draw us closer to Him and strengthen our faith, leading us to maturity and completeness ([Psalm 34:18](https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/34/Psalm-34-18.html); [James 1:2-4](https://www.bibleref.com/James/1/James-1-2.html)). Through our experiences, we can become a testimony of comfort to others ([2 Corinthians 1:3-5](https://www.bibleref.com/2-Corinthians/1/2-Corinthians-1-3.html)). However, this is not an easy process. It requires daily surrendering of our own will to His, faithful study of His attributes as revealed in His Word, consistent prayer, and practical application of what we learn to our own situations. By doing so, our faith will gradually grow and mature, equipping us to trust Him through future tragedies that are sure to come.

In summary, it is important to recognize that being angry with God is not justified. Anger at God often stems from an inability or unwillingness to trust Him even when we don't understand His ways. Instead of directing our anger towards God, we should pour out our hearts to Him in prayer and trust that He is in control of His perfect plan.

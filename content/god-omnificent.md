## God's Omnificence: The Power to Create All Things

The concept of omnificence refers to the ability to create all things, possessing unlimited power to bring forth existence. In the Bible, the first verse of Genesis affirms God's omnificence: "In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth." This divine attribute is also emphasized in [Colossians 1:15](https://www.bibleref.com/Colossians/1/Colossians-1-15.html)–17, which speaks of Jesus, the second Person of the Trinity, as the image of the invisible God and affirms that all things were created through Him and for Him.

God's omnificence stems from His omnipotence, which denotes His infinite power. Scripture attests that God is stronger and more powerful than any created being or object. [Job 37:23](https://www.bibleref.com/Job/37/Job-37-23.html) states, "The Almighty is beyond our reach and exalted in power; in his justice and great righteousness, he does not oppress." In [Jeremiah 32:17](https://www.bibleref.com/Jeremiah/32/Jeremiah-32-17.html), it is acknowledged that God made the heavens and the earth by His great power and outstretched arm, with nothing being too hard for Him. Thus, God possesses the power to do all things.

Another attribute closely related to God's omnificence is His omniscience, which characterizes Him as infinite in knowledge. In the act of creation, God's omniscience worked hand in hand with His omnificence. [Proverbs 3:19](https://www.bibleref.com/Proverbs/3/Proverbs-3-19.html) reveals that by wisdom the Lord laid the earth's foundations and by understanding He set the heavens in place. Being omnificent, having created all things, naturally equips God with comprehensive knowledge. First [John 3:20](https://www.bibleref.com/John/3/John-3-20.html) asserts that God is greater than our hearts and knows all things. [Isaiah 46:10](https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/46/Isaiah-46-10.html) further elucidates that God knows the future as well as the past, making known the end from the beginning. Even our thoughts are known to Him before they are formed: "Before a word is on my tongue you, LORD, know it completely" ([Psalm 139:4](https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/139/Psalm-139-4.html)).

The Bible unveils numerous other attributes of God, many of which find expression in His creative work. [Romans 1:20](https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/1/Romans-1-20.html) affirms that since the creation of the world, God's invisible qualities—His eternal power and divine nature—have been clearly seen and understood through what has been made. Psalm 104 is a psalm replete with praise for our omnificent God. It marvels at the multitude of His works and acknowledges the wisdom displayed in their creation. The psalm extols the creation of light, clouds, wind, seas, mountains, valleys, beasts of the field, birds of the sky, trees, sun and moon, and the very rhythm of life. All these serve as testaments to God's omnificence.

[Psalm 40:5](https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/40/Psalm-40-5.html) contemplates the depth of God's omnificence and acknowledges that His wonders are too numerous to declare: "Many, LORD my God, are the wonders you have done. . . . None can compare with you; were I to speak and tell of your deeds, they would be too many to declare." God's creative power is limitless and surpasses our ability to fully comprehend. He is our omnificent Creator, Sustainer, and the sole source of eternal life. [Acts 17:28](https://www.bibleref.com/Acts/17/Acts-17-28.html) encapsulates this truth by stating that in Him we live, move, and have our being.

### Why This Matters

Understanding God's omnificence is vital because it reminds us of His unmatched power and authority over all creation. Recognizing that everything around us is a product of His divine creativity deepens our appreciation for His greatness. Moreover, comprehending God's omniscience reveals His intimate knowledge of us and His meticulous involvement in our lives. This understanding fosters a sense of awe and reverence towards our Creator.

### Think About It

1. Reflect on the complexity and diversity of creation. How does the reality of God's omnificence impact your perception of His creative work?
2. Consider the implications of God's omniscience for your life. How does knowing that God knows you completely and is involved in every aspect of your existence affect your relationship with Him?
3. Meditate on the fact that God's power and knowledge are far beyond human comprehension. How does this deepen your trust in Him and His plans for your life?

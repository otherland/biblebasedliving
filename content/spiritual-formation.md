# Spiritual Formation: A Conservative Christian Perspective

## What is spiritual formation?

Spiritual formation is the process by which believers are shaped and transformed into the image of Jesus Christ. It involves the ongoing work of the Holy Spirit in our lives, changing us from the inside out to reflect the character and nature of Christ. As Christians, we are called to be disciples of Jesus and to live in obedience to His teachings. This process of spiritual formation encompasses all areas of our lives, including our thoughts, attitudes, behaviors, and relationships.

The goal of spiritual formation is to become more like Christ, growing in our love for God and others, and living out the values and principles of the Kingdom of God. It is a lifelong journey that requires intentional effort and surrender to the work of the Holy Spirit. While salvation is a one-time event, spiritual formation is an ongoing process of growth and transformation.

**Biblical Foundation:** 
- [Romans 8:29](https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/8/Romans-8-29.html) (ESV) - "For those whom he foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son..."
- [2 Corinthians 3:18](https://www.bibleref.com/2-Corinthians/3/2-Corinthians-3-18.html) (ESV) - "And we all, with unveiled face, beholding the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from one degree of glory to another..."

## How does spiritual formation differ from discipleship?

While spiritual formation and discipleship are closely related concepts, they have distinct nuances. Discipleship refers to the process of following Jesus and learning from Him. It involves studying His teachings, imitating His example, and spreading the Gospel to others. Discipleship includes teaching and evangelism, as well as personal growth in knowledge and obedience to God's Word.

On [the other hand](/exploring-the-sacred-sites-of-bethany-and-jerusalem-a-christian-pilgrimage-guide), spiritual formation goes beyond discipleship by emphasizing the transformative work of the Holy Spirit in our lives. It recognizes that true change and growth come from within, as we yield ourselves to the leading and empowering of the Spirit. Spiritual formation is not just about acquiring knowledge or practicing certain disciplines; it is about being shaped by God's Spirit into the likeness of Christ.

**Biblical Foundation:**
- [Galatians 5:22-23](https://www.bibleref.com/Galatians/5/Galatians-5-22.html) (ESV) - "But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control..."
- [Philippians 2:13](https://www.bibleref.com/Philippians/2/Philippians-2-13.html) (ESV) - "for it is God who works in you, both to will and to work for his good pleasure."

## When and how did spiritual formation start?

The concept of spiritual formation has its roots in the early church. From the very beginning, believers recognized the need for growth and transformation in their lives as they sought to follow Jesus. The early Christians practiced spiritual formation through various means such as teaching, discipleship, baptism, and liturgical worship.

In the early church, spiritual formation was seen as a vital part of Christian ministry. It involved not only teaching new believers but also guiding them in the process of becoming more like Christ. The practices and disciplines of spiritual formation were seen as essential for nurturing faith and deepening one's relationship with God.

**Biblical Foundation:**
- [Acts 2:42](https://www.bibleref.com/Acts/2/Acts-2-42.html) (ESV) - "And they devoted themselves to the apostles' teaching and the fellowship, to the breaking of bread and the prayers."

## How does Scripture guide spiritual formation?

Scripture is central to spiritual formation. It is through God's Word that we hear His voice and learn His ways. The Bible provides us with a clear understanding of who God is, who we are as His children, and how we are called to live. It contains instructions for every aspect of life and faith.

In spiritual formation, Scripture serves as a guide and a source of wisdom. It reveals God's character and values, showing us the path of righteousness. Through studying and meditating on Scripture, we gain insight into God's will and His plan for our lives. Scripture also helps us to discern truth from error, enabling us to navigate the complexities of life and make wise choices.

**Biblical Foundation:**
- [Psalm 119:105](https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/119/Psalm-119-105.html) (ESV) - "Your word is a lamp to my feet and a light to my path."
- [2 Timothy 3:16-17](https://www.bibleref.com/2-Timothy/3/2-Timothy-3-16.html) (ESV) - "All Scripture is breathed out by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness, that the man of God may be complete, equipped for every good work."

## What spiritual disciplines are essential for formation?

Spiritual disciplines are intentional practices that help to cultivate spiritual growth and formation. They are tools that enable us to draw near to God, align our hearts with His, and deepen our relationship with Him. Some essential spiritual disciplines include prayer, Bible study, fasting, worship, solitude, silence, meditation, and service.

These disciplines are not ends in themselves but means to an end – they serve to create space in our lives for God to work and transform us. Through prayer, we communicate with God and seek His guidance. Through Bible study, we immerse ourselves in His Word and allow it to shape our thoughts and beliefs. Fasting helps us to deny our fleshly desires and focus on God. Worship allows us to express our love and adoration for Him. Solitude and silence provide opportunities for reflection and listening to His voice. Meditation helps us to dwell on His truth and apply it to our lives. Service enables us to demonstrate Christ's love in practical ways.

**Biblical Foundation:**
- [James 1:22](https://www.bibleref.com/James/1/James-1-22.html) (ESV) - "But be doers of the word, and not hearers only."
- [Psalm 46:10](https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/46/Psalm-46-10.html) (ESV) - "Be still, and know that I am God."

## How can families practice spiritual formation?

Daily family Bible study and prayer are essential for fostering spiritual formation within the family. Gathering together to read and discuss Scripture, pray, and worship God helps to cultivate a shared faith and a deepening relationship with Him. It also provides an opportunity for parents to model and impart biblical values to their children.

Child evangelism techniques, such as teaching biblical stories, memorizing Scripture, and engaging in age-appropriate discussions, can help children understand and apply God's Word to their lives. Youth discipleship home programs provide a structured environment for teenagers to grow in their faith through Bible study, mentorship, and accountability.

Developing a child's prayer life involves teaching them how to pray, modeling prayer in daily life, and encouraging them to have a personal relationship with God. Parents can guide their children in developing a habit of regular prayer and teach them different types of prayers (adoration, confession, thanksgiving, supplication).

**Biblical Foundation:**
- [Deuteronomy 6:6-7](https://www.bibleref.com/Deuteronomy/6/Deuteronomy-6-6.html) (ESV) - "And these words that I command you today shall be on your heart. You shall teach them diligently to your children..."
- [Proverbs 22:6](https://www.bibleref.com/Proverbs/22/Proverbs-22-6.html) (ESV) - "Train up a child in the way he should go; even when he is old he will not depart from it."

## How does spiritual formation impact our daily lives?

Spiritual formation impacts every aspect of our lives. As we grow in our relationship with God and become more like Christ, our thoughts, attitudes, behaviors, and relationships are transformed. We begin to see the world through the lens of Scripture and make decisions based on biblical principles.

Spiritual formation also affects our interactions with others. As we cultivate the fruit of the Spirit in our lives (love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control), we become a source of blessing and encouragement to those around us. Our character and actions reflect the nature of Christ and His love for the world.

In practical terms, spiritual formation means aligning our priorities with God's priorities, seeking His guidance in decision-making, and living out our faith in all areas of life – at home, at work, in our relationships, and in our involvement in the community. It means continually surrendering ourselves to the work of the Holy Spirit and allowing Him to transform us from the inside out.

**Biblical Foundation:**
- [Colossians 3:17](https://www.bibleref.com/Colossians/3/Colossians-3-17.html) (ESV) - "And whatever you do, in word or deed, do everything in the name of [the Lord Jesus](/christian-symbols-in-public-spaces)..."
- [Matthew 5:16](https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/5/Matthew-5-16.html) (ESV) - "Let your light shine before others, so that they may see your good works and give glory to your Father who is in heaven."

## Conclusion

Spiritual formation is an ongoing process of growth and transformation in which believers are shaped into the image of Christ. It involves intentional practices such as prayer, Bible study, fasting, worship, solitude, silence, meditation, and service. Scripture serves as our guide in this process, providing us with wisdom and insight into God's will. Spiritual formation impacts every aspect of our lives and enables us to live out our faith in a way that reflects the character and love of Christ.

As families, we can practice spiritual formation by engaging in daily family Bible study and prayer, teaching children biblical truths through age-appropriate methods, developing their prayer life, and participating in youth discipleship programs. Spiritual formation is not a one-time event but a lifelong journey that requires intentional effort and surrender to the work of [the Holy Spirit](/discover-the-importance-of-a-printable-spiritual-gifts-test-for-youth-in-christian-ministry). May we continually seek to grow in our relationship with God and be transformed into His likeness for His glory.

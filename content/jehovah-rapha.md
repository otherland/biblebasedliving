## Jehovah Rapha: The Lord Who Heals

Jehovah-Rapha, also known as Yahweh-Rapha, is one of the many names of God found in the Old Testament. In Hebrew, Jehovah-Rapha means "The Lord Who Heals." This name appears in [Exodus 15:26](https://www.bibleref.com/Exodus/15/Exodus-15-26.html) when God speaks to the Israelites and declares, "If you listen carefully to the Lord your God and do what is right in his eyes, if you pay attention to his commands and keep all his decrees, I will not bring on you any of the diseases I brought on the Egyptians, for I am the Lord, who heals you."

### The Context of Jehovah-Rapha

The revelation of God's name Jehovah-Rapha took place early on in the wilderness wanderings of the Israelites. After leaving Egypt and crossing the Red Sea, Moses led them into the Desert of Shur. For three days, they traveled without finding water ([Exodus 15:22](https://www.bibleref.com/Exodus/15/Exodus-15-22.html)). This was a test of their faith.

Soon after, they came across a body of water, but it was bitter and undrinkable. They named it Marah, meaning "bitter." The Israelites started grumbling against Moses, questioning what they would drink. Moses prayed to the Lord, who showed him a piece of wood. Moses threw it into the water as instructed by God, and miraculously, the water became sweet and fit to drink.

It was after this healing of the bitter waters that God revealed Himself as Jehovah-Rapha to the Israelites. He declared, "I am the Lord, who heals you" ([Exodus 15:26](https://www.bibleref.com/Exodus/15/Exodus-15-26.html)). This name signifies that God not only has the power to heal physical ailments but also to overcome impurity and corruption.

### The Promise of Healing

Along with revealing His name Jehovah-Rapha, God promised the Israelites that He would not bring upon them the diseases that afflicted the Egyptians. This promise referred to the ten plagues that God had sent upon Egypt, including boils, death of livestock, and devastating hail. However, this promise was conditional, requiring the Israelites to diligently listen to the voice of the Lord, do what is right in His eyes, and keep His commandments and statutes.

### Jehovah-Rapha's Healing Power

Jehovah-Rapha has the power to heal physically, emotionally, mentally, and spiritually. In the Old Testament, we see instances where God healed physical ailments such as leprosy ([2 Kings 5:10](https://www.bibleref.com/2-Kings/5/2-Kings-5-10.html)), provided comfort in times of distress ([Psalm 34:18](https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/34/Psalm-34-18.html)), restored sanity ([Daniel 4:34](https://www.bibleref.com/Daniel/4/Daniel-4-34.html)), and forgave sins ([Psalm 103:2](https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/103/Psalm-103-2.html)â€“3).

Jesus Christ, the incarnation of God, showed Himself to be the ultimate expression of Jehovah-Rapha. During His ministry on Earth, Jesus traveled from town to town in Galilee, healing every disease and sickness among the people ([Matthew 4:23](https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/4/Matthew-4-23.html)). Large crowds followed Him in Judea, where He healed them ([Matthew 19:2](https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/19/Matthew-19-2.html)). Everywhere He went, people brought their sick to Him, and all who touched even the edge of His cloak were healed ([Mark 6:56](https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/6/Mark-6-56.html)).

Jesus not only healed people physically but also brought spiritual healing through forgiveness of sins. He demonstrated Himself as Jehovah-Rapha in the flesh. Every day and in every way, Jesus proved that He is the Lord who heals.

### Why This Matters

The name Jehovah-Rapha reminds us of God's healing power. It assures us that God is not only concerned with our physical well-being but also desires to heal our brokenness in every aspect of our lives. Whether we are facing physical ailments, emotional distress, mental struggles, or spiritual emptiness, we can turn to Jehovah-Rapha for restoration and healing.

Knowing God as Jehovah-Rapha can bring comfort and hope, especially in times of hardship and suffering. It reminds us that God is not distant or unconcerned but intimately involved in our lives. He is present to provide healing and restoration when we seek Him with faith.

### Think About It

## King of Kings, Lord of Lords

The phrase "King of kings" and "Lord of lords" is mentioned multiple times in Scripture. It is used to describe God the Father, Jesus Christ, as well as earthly kings who used the title to express their absolute sovereignty over their realms. 

### 1. God the Father: King of Kings

The title "King of kings" is applied to God the Father in [1 Timothy 6:15](https://www.bibleref.com/1-Timothy/6/1-Timothy-6-15.html). This title emphasizes His supreme authority and dominion over all other rulers. It signifies that there is no higher authority than God Himself. He is the ultimate King, ruling over all creation.

### 2. Jesus Christ: King of Kings and Lord of Lords

The title "King of kings" is also attributed to Jesus Christ in [Revelation 17:14](https://www.bibleref.com/Revelation/17/Revelation-17-14.html) and 19:16. In these passages, Jesus is described as the one who has the power and authority to exercise absolute dominion over all creation. He is given the full title "KING OF KINGS AND LORD OF LORDS." This means that in the end, all other rulers will be conquered or abolished, and Jesus alone will reign supreme as King and Lord of all the earth.

It is important to note that the order of the title is reversed in [Revelation 17:14](https://www.bibleref.com/Revelation/17/Revelation-17-14.html), which states "Lord of lords and King of kings." The reversal of the order does not change the meaning; it simply emphasizes both aspects of Jesus' authority.

### 3. Earthly Kings: Temporary Sovereignty

The phrase "king of kings" is also used to refer to earthly kings who used it to assert their absolute sovereignty over their realms. For example, Artaxerxes and Nebuchadnezzar, kings of Persia and Babylon respectively, used this title to express their authority and dominance over their subjects. However, it is crucial to understand that their sovereignty was temporary and limited to their earthly kingdoms.

### Why This Matters

Understanding the concept of Jesus being the King of kings and Lord of lords is essential for Christians. It reminds us of the ultimate authority and sovereignty of God the Father and Jesus Christ. It reinforces our trust in God's plan and His ability to conquer all opposition. It also encourages us to submit to the lordship of Jesus Christ, recognizing His supreme authority in our lives.

### Think About It

Reflecting on Jesus' title as the King of kings and Lord of lords should lead us to consider our own response to His authority. Are we willingly submitting to His lordship in our lives? Do we recognize His absolute sovereignty over every aspect of our existence? Let us meditate on these questions and strive to align our lives with the kingship of Jesus Christ.

## The Absolute Rule of Jesus

The title "King of kings and Lord of lords" signifies the absolute rule of Jesus over all creation. Throughout Scripture, there are numerous references to His pre-eminence over other rulers, emphasizing His power and authority.

### 1. Jesus' Rule Proclaimed by Isaiah

[Isaiah 40:23](https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/40/Isaiah-40-23.html)–24 declares that the Lord brings earthly rulers to nothing, making them emptiness. The mere breath of the Lord will carry them off like stubble. This passage highlights the temporary nature of human rulership compared to the everlasting dominion of God.

### 2. Daniel's Vision of One like a Son of Man

In [Daniel 7:13](https://www.bibleref.com/Daniel/7/Daniel-7-13.html)–14, Daniel has a vision of one whom he calls "the Ancient of Days" - God the Father - who gives an everlasting dominion over all people, nations, and languages to "one like a son of man" - referring to God the Son, Jesus Christ. This vision reveals that Jesus will have an eternal kingdom that will never be destroyed.

### 3. Jesus' Superiority over Angels

The writer of Hebrews emphasizes Jesus' superiority over the angels, stating that He is the radiance of the glory of God and upholds the universe by the word of His power ([Hebrews 1:3](https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/1/Hebrews-1-3.html)). This passage highlights Jesus' role in creation and His authority over all things.

### 4. Humility to Exaltation

Paul discusses Jesus' humility and exaltation in [Philippians 2:5](https://www.bibleref.com/Philippians/2/Philippians-2-5.html)–11. He explains that Jesus humbled Himself, even to the point of death on a cross, and as a result, God highly exalted Him and bestowed on Him the name that is above every name. This passage demonstrates the journey from Jesus' humble earthly ministry to His glorification as King of kings and Lord of lords.

### Why This Matters

Understanding Jesus' absolute rule helps us recognize His sovereignty and power. It assures us that no power, king, or lord can oppose Him and win. This knowledge strengthens our faith and trust in Him as we face challenges and difficulties. It reminds us that Jesus is in control, and ultimately, He will triumph over all opposition.

### Think About It

Contemplating the absolute rule of Jesus should lead us to reflect on our own lives. Do we acknowledge His authority in every aspect of our existence? Are we surrendering our will to His perfect rule? Let us examine our hearts and strive to align ourselves with His kingship.

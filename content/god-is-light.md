## God is Light

In the Bible, the concept of light is frequently used as a metaphor to describe God and His attributes. The phrase "God is light" appears in [1 John 1:5](https://www.bibleref.com/1-John/1/1-John-1-5.html), emphasizing the holiness and righteousness of God. This metaphorical use of light can be seen throughout the scriptures. [Proverbs 4:18](https://www.bibleref.com/Proverbs/4/Proverbs-4-18.html) symbolizes righteousness as the "morning sun," while [Philippians 2:15](https://www.bibleref.com/Philippians/2/Philippians-2-15.html) compares blameless and pure believers to shining stars in the sky.

Light is often associated with good works and righteousness. Jesus encourages His followers to let their light shine before others so that they may see their good deeds ([Matthew 5:16](https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/5/Matthew-5-16.html)). In [Psalm 76:4](https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/76/Psalm-76-4.html), God is described as radiant with light. This depiction highlights the purity and goodness that emanate from His nature.

The contrast between light and darkness is another important aspect of this metaphor. Just as light represents righteousness, darkness symbolizes evil and sin. The Apostle John warns that if we claim to have fellowship with God but walk in darkness, we lie and do not live out the truth ([1 John 1:6](https://www.bibleref.com/1-John/1/1-John-1-6.html)). In verse 5, it is stated that God is light, and in Him, there is no darkness at all. This emphasizes that God is completely holy and without any trace of sin or injustice.

Understanding that God is light implies that to truly know Him, we must also walk in the light. Believers who have a relationship with God are considered children of the light and are called to live in righteousness ([1 Thessalonians 5:5](https://www.bibleref.com/1-Thessalonians/5/1-Thessalonians-5-5.html)). By partaking in God's divine nature, they have escaped the corruption caused by evil desires ([2 Peter 1:4](https://www.bibleref.com/2-Peter/1/2-Peter-1-4.html)).

Jesus, as the Son of God, also embodies this idea of light. He declares Himself as the "light of the world" ([John 8:12](https://www.bibleref.com/John/8/John-8-12.html)). Those who follow Him will never walk in darkness but will have the light of life. This statement implies that as Christians, we are meant to grow in holiness and mature in faith as we follow Jesus ([2 Peter 3:18](https://www.bibleref.com/2-Peter/3/2-Peter-3-18.html)).

As children of the light, believers are called to reflect God's light into a world darkened by sin. This involves confessing our own sins and allowing God to shine His light through us. By doing so, we can expose the hidden things of darkness and reveal the truth ([John 3:20](https://www.bibleref.com/John/3/John-3-20.html)).

### Why This Matters

Understanding that God is light has significant implications for our relationship with Him and how we live our lives as Christians. It reminds us of God's holiness and righteousness, which should motivate us to pursue righteousness in our own lives. It also calls us to be a light in the world, sharing the truth of the Gospel and exposing the darkness of sin.

### Think About It

1. How does the metaphor of light help us understand God's character and attributes?
2. What are some practical ways we can let our light shine before others?
3. In what ways can we reflect God's light into a world darkened by sin?

## Agnus Dei: The Lamb of God

The term Agnus Dei, which is Latin for "Lamb of God," holds significant biblical and theological meaning. It is derived from [John 1:29](https://www.bibleref.com/John/1/John-1-29.html), where John the Baptist refers to Jesus as the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world. This imagery is also found in [Revelation 5:9-14](https://www.bibleref.com/Revelation/5/Revelation-5-9.html), where the Lamb who was slain is worshipped by angels and all of creation.

### The Biblical Basis for Agnus Dei

[John 1:29](https://www.bibleref.com/John/1/John-1-29.html) introduces the concept of Jesus as the Lamb of God. In this verse, John the Baptist sees Jesus approaching and declares, "Look, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!" This declaration connects Jesus to the sacrificial system in Jewish tradition, where lambs were offered as sacrifices for sin.

[Revelation 5:9-14](https://www.bibleref.com/Revelation/5/Revelation-5-9.html) further emphasizes the significance of the Lamb. Here, the Lamb who has been slain is worshipped by angels, living creatures, and elders. They proclaim that the Lamb is worthy to receive power, wealth, wisdom, honor, glory, and praise. This passage portrays both the sacrifice and victory of Christ as the Lamb.

### Two Meanings of Agnus Dei

The term Agnus Dei can refer to two things within church history and liturgy:

1. A figure or symbol of a lamb with a halo and bearing a cross or banner. This representation of Christ as the Lamb can often be seen in church artwork and stained glass windows.
2. A prayer to Christ known as the Agnus Dei prayer. This prayer is part of the Roman Catholic liturgy and is recited during Mass. In Latin, it goes: "Agnus Dei, qui tolis peccata mundi, miserere nobis. Agnus Dei, qui tolis peccata mundi, dona nobis pacem," which translates to "Lamb of God, who takes away the sins of the world, have mercy on us. Lamb of God, who takes away the sins of the world, grant us peace."

### Understanding Agnus Dei in Different Christian Traditions

While Catholics and Evangelicals both recognize Jesus as the Lamb of God who takes away the sins of the world, there are differences in how they apply this concept:

In Roman Catholic theology, the Agnus Dei prayer is seen as a plea for mercy, similar to pleading for leniency before a judge. It is part of a cycle that involves sin, confession, and penance. The faithful Catholic believes that through this process, grace is gradually infused, ultimately making them righteous enough to be saved by God.

For Evangelicals who have trusted in Christ for salvation, the Agnus Dei prayer takes on a different meaning. They understand that they have already received mercy and are at peace with God through faith in Christ. Therefore, their prayer would be one of thanksgiving for the blessings they have already received.

### Why This Matters

Understanding the significance of Agnus Dei helps Christians grasp the depth of Christ's sacrifice and victory over sin. It reminds believers of Jesus' role as the Lamb who takes away their sins and grants them peace with God. Recognizing Agnus Dei allows Christians to approach God with humility and gratitude for His mercy.

### Think About It

Consider the imagery of Jesus as the Lamb of God. How does this concept impact your understanding of His sacrifice? How does it shape your relationship with Him? Take a moment to reflect on the significance of Agnus Dei in your own spiritual journey.

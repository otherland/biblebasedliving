## Anthropomorphism: Understanding God's Nature and Actions

Anthropomorphism is the process of assigning human characteristics to God. In theological terms, it means making God in some way into the form of man. Throughout the Bible, we find human traits and actions ascribed to the Creator. This helps us comprehend God's nature and actions, even though we understand that God is a spiritual being.

### God's Physical Attributes

In several places in the Bible, God is described as having physical attributes similar to humans. For example, He is said to "set His face" against evil ([Leviticus 20:6](https://www.bibleref.com/Leviticus/20/Leviticus-20-6.html)), make "His face" shine on His people ([Numbers 6:25](https://www.bibleref.com/Numbers/6/Numbers-6-25.html)), and stretch out His hand ([Exodus 7:5](https://www.bibleref.com/Exodus/7/Exodus-7-5.html); [Isaiah 23:11](https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/23/Isaiah-23-11.html)). These descriptions are not meant to be taken literally, as God is a spirit, not flesh and blood. However, they help us understand His nature and actions in terms that we can relate to.

### Human Emotions Ascribed to God

The Bible also ascribes human emotions to God. He is described as being "sorry" ([Genesis 6:6](https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/6/Genesis-6-6.html)), "jealous" ([Exodus 20:5](https://www.bibleref.com/Exodus/20/Exodus-20-5.html)), and "moved to pity" ([Judges 2:18](https://www.bibleref.com/Judges/2/Judges-2-18.html)). We read that He "changed His mind" ([Exodus 32:14](https://www.bibleref.com/Exodus/32/Exodus-32-14.html)) and "relented" ([2 Samuel 24:16](https://www.bibleref.com/2-Samuel/24/2-Samuel-24-16.html)). These anthropomorphic descriptions help us grasp God's love, anger, and other emotions that are important for our understanding of His character.

### The Limitations of Anthropomorphism

While anthropomorphisms can be helpful in enabling us to partially comprehend the incomprehensible nature of God, we must recognize their limitations. Our human expressions are inherently inadequate in fully explaining the divine. It is important not to see anthropomorphisms as sufficient in portraying God's unlimited power, love, and mercy. We must approach God's Word with the understanding that He offers only a glimpse of His glory through means that we can comprehend.

### God's Incomparable Ways

In [Isaiah 55:8-9](https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/55/Isaiah-55-8.html), God reminds us that His thoughts and ways are beyond our human comprehension: "For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways," declares the LORD. "As the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts." This verse emphasizes the vast difference between God's wisdom and understanding compared to ours. It reminds us to humbly acknowledge the limitations of our knowledge and trust in God's infinite wisdom.

### Why This Matters

Understanding anthropomorphism is essential for our relationship with God. It helps us relate to Him on a personal level and comprehend His nature and actions in human terms. By ascribing human characteristics to God, we can better grasp His love, anger, and other emotions that impact our lives. However, it is crucial to remember that anthropomorphisms should not limit our understanding of God or diminish His incomparable power and mercy.

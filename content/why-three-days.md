## Why Three Days: The Significance of Jesus' Resurrection

The resurrection of Jesus Christ after three days of death holds great significance in the Christian faith. It not only proved to Jesus' opponents that He truly rose from the dead, but it also fulfilled biblical prophecy. In this article, we will explore why it was important for Jesus to be dead for three days before His resurrection.

### The Significance of Three Days

According to Jewish tradition, a person's soul or spirit remained with their dead body for three days. After three days, the soul or spirit departed. By waiting for three days before His resurrection, Jesus ensured that no one could argue that He had never truly died. This was crucial in proving the reality of His resurrection to His opponents. We see a similar pattern in the story of Lazarus, where Jesus intentionally waited several days after Lazarus' death before raising him from the dead ([John 11:38](https://www.bibleref.com/John/11/John-11-38.html)–44). This action removed any doubt and made it clear that Lazarus had indeed been dead.

### Fulfillment of Biblical Prophecy

Jesus Himself prophesied that He would be dead for three days ([Matthew 12:40](https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/12/Matthew-12-40.html); 16:21; 27:63; [John 2:19](https://www.bibleref.com/John/2/John-2-19.html)). These prophecies emphasized the importance of the three-day period. Additionally, some scholars point to [Hosea 6:1](https://www.bibleref.com/Hosea/6/Hosea-6-1.html)–3 as a prophecy of the Messiah's resurrection after three days: "Come, let us return to the LORD... After two days he will revive us; on the third day he will restore us, that we may live in his presence." This passage may also be the one referred to by Paul in [1 Corinthians 15:4](https://www.bibleref.com/1-Corinthians/15/1-Corinthians-15-4.html) when he says that Jesus "was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures." The fulfillment of these prophecies further solidifies the significance of the three-day period.

### The Symbolism of Jesus' Death and Resurrection

Jesus died on a Friday, which was Nisan 14, the day when the Passover lamb was sacrificed. His death symbolizes the sacrifice of a perfect, unblemished lamb on our behalf. The resurrection on the third day, which took place on the first day of the week, represents a new beginning and new life for all who trust in Him. Just as the Israelites were delivered from slavery in Egypt through the blood of the Passover lamb, we are delivered from sin and death through the sacrificial death and resurrection of Jesus Christ.

### Why This Matters

Understanding the significance of Jesus being dead for three days before His resurrection helps us grasp the magnitude of what He accomplished through His death and resurrection. It confirms His victory over death and demonstrates His fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies. This knowledge strengthens our faith and provides assurance that Jesus is indeed the promised Messiah.

### Think About It

Consider the impact of Jesus' resurrection after three days on His disciples and followers. They had witnessed His crucifixion and were devastated by His death. However, when He rose from the dead three days later, their sorrow turned into joy, and their faith was strengthened. Reflecting on this can remind us of the hope we have in Jesus and encourage us to trust in Him even in difficult times.

In conclusion, the three-day period between Jesus' death and resurrection holds great significance in the Christian faith. It served as evidence to Jesus' opponents that He had truly been dead, fulfilled biblical prophecy, and symbolized a new beginning and new life for all who believe in Him. Understanding these truths deepens our understanding of and faith in Jesus Christ.

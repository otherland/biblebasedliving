## Jesus Loves the Little Children

The famous children’s hymn "Jesus Loves the Little Children" holds a significant place in Christian worship. This hymn, written by C. Herbert Woolston and composed by George F. Root, conveys a powerful message about Jesus' love for all children. The lyrics are simple yet profound, stating that Jesus loves children of all races and backgrounds because they are precious in His sight.

### Jesus' Love for Children in the Bible

The concept of Jesus loving children is supported by various passages in the Bible. These accounts illustrate how Jesus valued and showed love to children during His time on earth. One well-known story is found in [Mark 10:13](https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/10/Mark-10-13.html)–14, 16, where people brought little children to Jesus for Him to bless them. Although the disciples initially rebuked them, Jesus became indignant and said, "Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these." He then took the children in His arms, placed His hands on them, and blessed them.

Furthermore, Jesus performed miracles to heal and restore children's lives. In [John 4:46](https://www.bibleref.com/John/4/John-4-46.html)–52, He healed a nobleman's son from a distance. There are also instances where Jesus cast out demons from children ([Mark 7:24](https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/7/Mark-7-24.html)–30; 9:14–27), showcasing His power and compassion for their well-being. Additionally, Jesus raised at least one child from the dead ([Luke 8:40](https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/8/Luke-8-40.html)–56), demonstrating His authority over life and death.

### The Humility of Children

Jesus taught that we should have the humility of children. In [Matthew 18:2](https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/18/Matthew-18-2.html)–4, He called a little child to Him and said, "Truly I tell you, unless you change and become like little children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven. Therefore, whoever takes the lowly position of this child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven." In this passage, Jesus emphasizes the importance of humility and childlike faith.

What does it mean to have the humility of a child? It means having a faith devoid of ambition, pride, and haughtiness. Children are naturally teachable and have a humble trust in their parents. Similarly, we are called to approach our relationship with God with the same teachable spirit and trust in His guidance.

### Why This Matters

Understanding Jesus' love for children is essential for several reasons. Firstly, it reminds us that every child is precious in God's sight, regardless of their background or ethnicity. This truth challenges us to treat children with love, care, and respect, following the example set by Jesus Himself.

Secondly, recognizing Jesus' interactions with children helps us understand His character and heart. He valued children and took the time to bless them individually. This reveals the depth of His love and compassion for all people, especially those who are vulnerable and dependent like children.

Lastly, Jesus' teaching on having the humility of a child has broader implications for our faith. It calls us to approach God with a childlike trust and openness to learn from Him. Embracing humility allows us to grow spiritually and develop a deeper relationship with our Heavenly Father.

### Think About It

Reflecting on Jesus' love for children can lead us to ask ourselves important questions. How do we demonstrate love and care for children in our communities? Are there ways we can actively support and uplift children who may be marginalized or in need? Additionally, how can we cultivate childlike humility in our own lives? What steps can we take to approach God with trust, teachability, and a willingness to learn from Him?

As followers of Christ, it is crucial that we not only acknowledge Jesus' love for children but also embody that love through our actions. By doing so, we can make a positive impact on the lives of children, reflecting the love and compassion of Jesus to the world around us.

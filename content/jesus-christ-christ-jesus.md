## Jesus Christ and Christ Jesus

Jesus Christ and Christ Jesus are two terms used in the Bible to refer to the Son of God, but what is the significance of these titles? Let's take a closer look at these terms and their meaning.

### Jesus Christ and Christ Jesus: Explained

The name "Jesus" refers to the human name given to the Son of God when He became incarnate and was born to Mary. On the other hand, "Christ" is a title that means "Messiah," "Anointed One," or "Chosen One." In some passages of the New Testament, you will find the term "Jesus Christ," where the human name is placed first, while in other instances, you will find "Christ Jesus," with the title placed first. This slight difference in word order has led some to wonder if there is any significance in using one term over the other.

In many languages, including English, word order can be changed for emphasis. Placing words at the beginning or end of a sentence tends to give them more attention. However, in this case, the difference between "Jesus Christ" and "Christ Jesus" is subtle. Both terms attribute the same honor to Jesus by using the title "Christ" alongside His personal name.

### The Hymn in [Philippians 2:5-11](https://www.bibleref.com/Philippians/2/Philippians-2-5.html)

One important passage that sheds light on the significance of these titles is found in [Philippians 2:5-11](https://www.bibleref.com/Philippians/2/Philippians-2-5.html). In this passage, the apostle Paul quotes an early Christian hymn that speaks about the kenosis or "emptying" of Jesus Christ as He took on human form. This hymn helps believers understand the theology behind Jesus' incarnation and sacrifice.

The hymn begins with God becoming man, using the term "Christ Jesus" to emphasize His heavenly title followed by His human name. It then ends with Jesus ascending to glory, using "Jesus Christ" to highlight His humanity followed by His heavenly title. This switch in terminology aligns perfectly with the theme of the hymn, reflecting the direction Jesus is taking in His journey from God to man and back to God.

### Usage of "Christ Jesus" and "Jesus Christ" by Apostles

It is interesting to note that the apostle Paul more frequently uses the term "Christ Jesus" compared to other apostles who usually say "Jesus Christ." John, for example, never writes "Christ Jesus" but always puts the human name first. This difference in usage may be attributed to Paul's unique perspective as someone who never physically walked with Jesus. He may have used "Christ Jesus" in a more formal way, recognizing Jesus' divine title alongside His human name.

### The Significance of "Jesus Christ" and "Christ Jesus"

In most contexts, the difference between using "Jesus Christ" or "Christ Jesus" is insignificant. Placing the human name first slightly emphasizes the Lord's humanity, while placing the divine title first highlights His deity. However, regardless of the order, both titles convey the same truth: Jesus is the Christ, the Messiah, and the Chosen One of God.

## Why This Matters

Understanding the significance of the terms "Jesus Christ" and "Christ Jesus" helps us appreciate the depth of Jesus' identity. It reminds us that He is both fully God and fully man. This profound truth has major implications for our salvation and relationship with God. By becoming fully human, Jesus was able to reconcile us to God through His sacrifice on the cross. Recognizing Him as both Jesus Christ and Christ Jesus enables us to grasp the magnitude of His work on our behalf.

## Think About It

Consider how the use of "Jesus Christ" and "Christ Jesus" in scripture reveals both Jesus' divinity and humanity. Reflect on what it means for you personally that Jesus is both fully God and fully man. How does this impact your understanding of His sacrifice and your relationship with Him? Take a moment to thank God for sending His Son, Jesus Christ, to reconcile you to Himself.

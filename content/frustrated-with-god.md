## Frustrated with God: Understanding and Dealing with Our Feelings

Frustration is a common human emotion that arises when we feel our needs are not being met or when we face seemingly insurmountable problems. At times, this frustration can be directed towards God. We may question why God does not intervene in our situations or why He allows certain things to happen. It is important for Christians to address and understand these feelings of frustration with God, as they can become stumbling blocks in our faith journey.

### What is Frustration?

Frustration is a feeling of impatience and anxiety that arises when our expectations are not met. It often stems from a sense of dissatisfaction with our circumstances or the way others are behaving. In the context of our relationship with God, frustration can arise when we feel that our prayers are going unanswered or when we perceive that God is not addressing our needs in the way we desire.

### Biblical Examples of Frustration with God

In the Bible, we find examples of individuals who experienced frustration with God. One such example is the story of Martha and Mary ([Luke 10:38-42](https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/10/Luke-10-38.html)). Martha was frustrated both with her sister for not helping her and with Jesus for not addressing the situation. Jesus responded by reminding Martha that she was worried and upset about many things, emphasizing the importance of being still and knowing God.

Another well-known story of frustration with God is that of Jonah. After reluctantly delivering God's message to the Ninevites, Jonah became frustrated because he desired to witness their destruction rather than their repentance. Jonah's frustration grew to the point where he wanted to die. In response, God reminded Jonah of his misplaced priorities and lack of compassion.

### Why is Frustration with God Wrong?

Frustration with God is ultimately a product of our sinful human nature. It can be evidence of a lack of trust in Him or a misunderstanding of His character. The Bible teaches us that God is perfect and has perfect intentions, timing, methods, and results ([Psalm 18:30](https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/18/Psalm-18-30.html)). When we focus our minds on the Lord and trust in Him, we can experience peace instead of frustration ([Isaiah 26:3](https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/26/Isaiah-26-3.html)).

Additionally, frustration with God may stem from our own stubbornness and desires conflicting with God's purposes. It is never advisable to fight against God's will. Saul of Tarsus, later known as the apostle Paul, learned this lesson when Jesus reminded him, "It is hard for you to kick against the goads" ([Acts 26:14](https://www.bibleref.com/Acts/26/Acts-26-14.html)). Instead of stubbornly insisting on our plans, it is important to humbly submit to God's will through prayer.

### Dealing with Frustration with God

When we find ourselves frustrated with God, it is essential to seek understanding and resolution. Here are some practical ways to address and navigate these feelings:

#### 1. Reflect on God's Character and Promises

Take time to study and meditate on the attributes of God revealed in His Word. Understand that He is loving, compassionate, just, and sovereign. Remind yourself of His promises to never leave or forsake you ([Deuteronomy 31:6](https://www.bibleref.com/Deuteronomy/31/Deuteronomy-31-6.html)) and to work all things together for good ([Romans 8:28](https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/8/Romans-8-28.html)).

#### 2. Seek Wisdom from Scripture and Prayer

Turn to the Bible for guidance and wisdom. Read passages that speak to your specific frustrations or challenges. Engage in prayer, pouring out your heart honestly before God. Ask Him for wisdom, understanding, and peace amidst your frustrations.

#### 3. Trust in God's Timing

Recognize that God works according to His perfect timing. His ways are higher than our ways ([Isaiah 55:9](https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/55/Isaiah-55-9.html)), and He knows what is best for us. Trust that He is working behind the scenes, even when it feels like nothing is happening.

#### 4. Surrender Your Desires to God

Instead of clinging stubbornly to your own plans and desires, surrender them to God. Recognize that His will may differ from yours, and trust that He knows what is ultimately best for you. Pray for a heart that aligns with His purposes and a willingness to submit to His leading.

#### 5. Seek Support from Fellow Believers

Share your frustrations and struggles with trusted Christian friends or mentors. They can provide encouragement, prayer, and guidance as you navigate through your frustrations with God. Together, you can seek understanding and find solace in knowing that others have faced similar challenges.

#### 6. Exercise Patience and Perseverance

Frustration with God can be an opportunity for growth in patience and perseverance. Remember that faith is not always about immediate results but about trusting in God's faithfulness and remaining steadfast in our commitment to Him.

### Why This Matters

Addressing our frustration with God is crucial for our spiritual well-being and growth. Unresolved frustrations can lead to bitterness, doubt, and distance in our relationship with Him. By understanding the root causes of our frustration and seeking resolution through prayer, studying Scripture, and surrendering our desires to God, we can experience renewed peace, trust, and a deeper relationship with Him.

### Think About It

1. Have you ever experienced frustration with God? What were the circumstances that led to this frustration? Reflect on how it affected your relationship with Him.

2. How can reflecting on the character of God and His promises help alleviate feelings of frustration?

3. Consider a specific area of frustration in your life right now. How can you surrender your desires and align your heart with God's will in this situation?

4. Seek out a trusted Christian friend or mentor who can support you in your frustrations. Share your struggles and seek their guidance and prayers.

Remember, frustration with God is a common experience, but it is essential to address it with humility, trust, and a willingness to seek understanding. As we surrender our frustrations to God and align our hearts with His purposes, we can find peace and grow deeper in our relationship with Him.

## Testing God: Understanding Acceptable and Unacceptable Approaches

Testing God is a concept that is discussed in the Bible, and it is important to understand the acceptable and unacceptable ways in which we can test God. One example of an acceptable kind of testing God can be found in the book of Malachi, where God invites His people to test Him in tithes and offerings. On the other hand, there is an unacceptable kind of testing that is rooted in doubt and demands something of God to prove Himself. In this article, we will explore these two types of testing in more detail.

### Acceptable Testing: Tithes and Offerings

In the book of Malachi, God challenges His people to bring the whole tithe into the storehouse and test Him in this matter. He promises that if they do so, He will open the floodgates of heaven and pour out so much blessing that there will not be enough room to store it. This invitation from God to test Him in tithes and offerings is unique in the Bible. The Hebrew word used for "test" in this verse means to examine, scrutinize, or prove. It is similar to how gold is tested with fire to prove its quality. Just as gold is proven through testing, God invites His people to test Him in tithes and offerings to see His faithfulness in response.

This acceptable kind of testing is based on faith. It requires trusting in God's promises and acting accordingly. By giving out of faith in who God is, He proves Himself to be faithful. It is important to note that this testing is specific to tithes and offerings and should not be applied to other areas of our relationship with God.

### Unacceptable Testing: Doubt and Demanding Signs

While there are instances where it is acceptable to test God, there are also examples of testing that are considered unacceptable. One such example can be found in [Deuteronomy 6:16](https://www.bibleref.com/Deuteronomy/6/Deuteronomy-6-16.html), where God commands Israel not to put Him to the test as they did at Massah. This kind of testing is characterized by doubt and a demand for signs or proof from God.

An illustration of this unacceptable testing can be seen when Jesus was tempted by Satan in the wilderness. Satan challenged Jesus to prove that He was the Son of God by throwing Himself down from the highest point of the temple. Satan even quoted Scripture to support his challenge, but Jesus responded by quoting [Deuteronomy 6:16](https://www.bibleref.com/Deuteronomy/6/Deuteronomy-6-16.html), stating that we should not put the Lord our God to the test. Jesus understood that it was not appropriate to manipulate situations or demand signs from God to prove Himself.

This kind of testing is rooted in doubt and a lack of trust in God's faithfulness. It involves trying to coerce God into fulfilling His promises by manipulating circumstances. It is important for us to accept God's Word by faith without requiring signs or demanding proof from Him. We need to trust in His promises and rely on His faithfulness.

### The Israelites' Testing at Massah

To further understand the concept of unacceptable testing, let's explore the occasion where the Israelites tested God at Massah, as recorded in Exodus 17. As the Israelites were journeying towards the Promised Land, they camped at a place where there was no water. Instead of trusting in God's provision, they immediately grumbled against God and quarreled with Moses.

Their lack of trust in God was evident in their accusations towards Moses, questioning why he had brought them out of Egypt only to let them die of thirst. The Israelites' doubt and fear overtook them, leading them to conclude that God had abandoned them. They questioned His reliability because He was not meeting their expectations.

This example highlights how doubt and lack of faith can lead us to test God in an unacceptable way. Instead of trusting in His provision and remaining faithful, the Israelites allowed their circumstances to shake their belief in God's faithfulness.

### The Role of Faith in Testing God

The key difference between acceptable and unacceptable testing lies in faith. [Hebrews 11:1](https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/11/Hebrews-11-1.html) defines faith as confidence in what we hope for and assurance about what we do not see. Acceptable testing is an expression of faith, where we trust in God's promises and act accordingly. It involves obedience and a willingness to take risks based on our belief in who God is.

Unacceptable testing, on the other hand, is driven by doubt and demands for signs or proof from God. It lacks true faith and reflects a lack of trust in His faithfulness. Instead of accepting His Word and trusting in His promises, it seeks to manipulate situations or coerce God into proving Himself.

### Why This Matters

Understanding the concept of testing God is important because it shapes our relationship with Him. Acceptable testing allows us to experience God's faithfulness as we trust in His promises and act in obedience. It deepens our faith and strengthens our relationship with Him.

On the contrary, unacceptable testing can damage our relationship with God. It reflects a lack of trust and a misunderstanding of His character. It can lead to disappointment, doubt, and a distorted view of who God truly is.

By discerning between acceptable and unacceptable testing, we can cultivate a healthy and vibrant relationship with God based on faith, trust, and obedience.

### Think About It

1. Reflect on your own approach to testing God. Are there areas where you have tested Him out of doubt or demanded signs from Him? How can you shift your perspective to one of faith and trust?

2. Consider the role of obedience in testing God. How does obedience demonstrate our faith in Him? In what ways can you actively obey His Word and trust in His promises?

3. Take a moment to thank God for His faithfulness. Recall instances where He has proven Himself trustworthy and faithful in your life. How can you continue to cultivate a deeper trust in Him?

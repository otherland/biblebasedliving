## How Old is God?

Age is a concept that measures the span from beginning to end. We determine age based on birthdays, counting the time that has passed since a person's birth. However, when it comes to God, we cannot assign Him an age because He did not have a beginning. God exists outside of time, so the question "how old is God?" doesn't apply to Him.

God created time as part of this universe to mark the passing of seasons and years for us ([Genesis 1:14](https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/1/Genesis-1-14.html); [Psalm 104:19](https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/104/Psalm-104-19.html)). But He Himself is not subject to time. In the New Testament, God describes Himself as "the alpha and omega, the beginning and the end" ([Revelation 1:8](https://www.bibleref.com/Revelation/1/Revelation-1-8.html), 11; 22:13). This means that God is always present at all times. There is no past or future with God; everything is as though it were occurring right now. This can be difficult for us to comprehend as we are bound by time.

When God revealed Himself to Moses, He said His name was "I AM WHO I AM" ([Exodus 3:14](https://www.bibleref.com/Exodus/3/Exodus-3-14.html)). From these Hebrew words, we derive the more familiar name for God: YAHWEH. By calling Himself "I AM," God was teaching Moses that He was incomparable and self-sufficient. Time cannot confine or define God. He has always been and always will be.

Asking "how old is God?" is an example of a category mistake—imputing a quality to something that properly belongs only to things of another category. Other category mistakes can be seen in questions such as "how long has this gravel been dead?" (it was never alive) or "what does the color orange sound like?" (colors are not sensed audibly). The question assumes that God should be categorized as having age, but He is timeless and does not belong in the same category as things subject to time.

Jesus, who is God in human form, had a physical birth on earth around the year 5 BC. However, this was simply the incarnation of the eternal Son of God, who exists outside of time. The Lord existed before His physical incarnation. In fact, the Bible states that the earth was created by Him and through Him ([Colossians 1:16](https://www.bibleref.com/Colossians/1/Colossians-1-16.html); [John 1:1](https://www.bibleref.com/John/1/John-1-1.html)–3). Before Abraham was born, Jesus said, "I am" ([John 8:58](https://www.bibleref.com/John/8/John-8-58.html)).

In summary, God does not have an age because He is timeless. He is eternal ([Genesis 21:33](https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/21/Genesis-21-33.html)) and holds the universe together. Without Him, nothing would exist ([John 1:3](https://www.bibleref.com/John/1/John-1-3.html)). If God had an age, it would mean He had a beginning and there was a time when there was no God, which is impossible. Because God has always been, we can trust that He will always be, and the future is secure for those who put their trust in Him ([Psalm 9:10](https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/9/Psalm-9-10.html); [Proverbs 30:5](https://www.bibleref.com/Proverbs/30/Proverbs-30-5.html)).

### Why This Matters

Understanding that God is timeless and exists outside of time helps us recognize His incomparable nature. It reminds us that He is not limited by temporal constraints like we are. This knowledge can deepen our trust in Him and give us confidence in His promises. It also encourages us to approach God with humility and reverence, recognizing His eternal existence and supreme authority.

### Think About It

1. How does the concept of God being timeless impact your understanding of His nature?
2. What implications does it have for your relationship with Him?
3. How does recognizing God's eternal existence affect your trust in His plans for your life?

## Knowledge of God

In the Bible, the phrase "knowledge of God" can be understood in different contexts. While sometimes it refers to God's knowledge, we will focus on the more common interpretation which refers to our knowledge of God. The knowledge of God is about knowing the truth about Him. It begins with God Himself, as He graciously chooses to reveal Himself to humanity in various ways.

### Knowing the Truth about God
The knowledge of God starts with an understanding of His existence and attributes. Through creation, God reveals Himself to everyone so that every person knows at least about His "eternal power and divine nature" ([Romans 1:20](https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/1/Romans-1-20.html)). This basic knowledge of God's righteousness and our moral responsibility is enough for us to be accountable for not following His law.

### Growing in the Knowledge of God
Those who fear God, or have a relationship with Him, can grow in the knowledge of God as He reveals Himself. This growth happens through various means such as the Scriptures, His people, His Holy Spirit, and His Son Jesus Christ. The Bible is a primary source of revelation, providing us with knowledge about God's will, works, and character. As we delve deeper into the Word of God, we gain wisdom and understanding through the guidance of the Holy Spirit.

### Relationship with God
In the Bible, the knowledge of God is closely tied to having a relationship with Him. Just as we grow closer to someone the more we know them, as we grow in our knowledge of God, we develop a deeper relationship with Him. Our goal as Christians is to become more like Jesus Christ through growing in the knowledge of God. This transformation should motivate us to live a life that is pleasing to Him.

### Sharing the Knowledge of God
As we grow in our knowledge of God, we are called to share it with others. Paul's ministry serves as an example of spreading the knowledge of God to everyone around him. We should also share the knowledge of God wherever we go so that others can come to know Him through the grace of His Son. Additionally, as we serve one another in Christian community, we help build each other up in our knowledge of God.

**Why This Matters:** The knowledge of God is foundational to our faith. It provides us with a deeper understanding of who God is and helps us align our lives with His will. As we grow in our knowledge of God, we draw closer to Him and become more like Jesus Christ. Additionally, sharing the knowledge of God is crucial for the expansion of His Kingdom and the transformation of lives.

**Think About It:** How can you actively seek to grow in your knowledge of God? In what ways can you share the knowledge of God with others in your everyday life?

By understanding the importance of the knowledge of God and actively seeking to grow in it, we can deepen our relationship with Him and impact others with His truth.

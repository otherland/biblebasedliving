Title: Does God Hate? Exploring the Truth Behind Divine Love and Judgment
---

## Does God Hate?

The question of whether or not God can hate may seem contradictory, considering that the Bible also tells us that God is love ([1 John 4:8](https://www.bibleref.com/1-John/4/1-John-4-8.html)). However, it is important to understand that while God is love, He also hates certain things. This article aims to explore this apparent contradiction and provide a biblical perspective on the topic.

### God's Nature of Love and Hatred

God's nature is characterized by love. In fact, the Bible tells us that God is love ([1 John 4:8](https://www.bibleref.com/1-John/4/1-John-4-8.html)). His love is unconditional, sacrificial, and always seeks what is best for others. However, because God is love, He also hates what is contrary to His nature. Just as we humans have the capacity to both love and hate, being created in the image of God, God too possesses both of these emotions.

God's hatred is directed towards sin and wickedness. He hates anything that goes against His perfect and holy nature. It is important to note that when the Bible speaks about God's hatred, it refers to the object of His hatred rather than an emotional state. God does not experience a sinful or malicious kind of hatred; instead, His hatred arises from a deep concern for what is good and just.

### What Does God Hate?

The Bible provides several examples of things that God hates. These include idolatry ([Deuteronomy 12:31](https://www.bibleref.com/Deuteronomy/12/Deuteronomy-12-31.html); 16:22), child sacrifice, sexual perversion ([Leviticus 20:1](https://www.bibleref.com/Leviticus/20/Leviticus-20-1.html)–23), and those who do evil ([Psalm 5:4](https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/5/Psalm-5-4.html)–6; 11:5). [Proverbs 6:16](https://www.bibleref.com/Proverbs/6/Proverbs-6-16.html)–19 lists seven things that the Lord hates: pride, lying, murder, evil plots, those who love evil, false witnesses, and troublemakers. It is important to observe that this passage does not only mention what God hates but also includes those who do such things. This is because sin cannot be separated from the sinner, except through the forgiveness available in Christ alone. God hates lying, but it is always a person—a liar—who chooses to lie. Therefore, God cannot judge the lie without also judging the liar.

### God's Love for Humanity

While God hates sin and wickedness, He loves the people of the world. [John 3:16](https://www.bibleref.com/John/3/John-3-16.html) tells us that God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son. God's love is inclusive and extends to all humanity. He desires the best for His creation and takes no pleasure in the death of the wicked ([Ezekiel 18:32](https://www.bibleref.com/Ezekiel/18/Ezekiel-18-32.html)). He is patient and does not want anyone to perish but desires everyone to come to repentance ([2 Peter 3:9](https://www.bibleref.com/2-Peter/3/2-Peter-3-9.html)).

Even before a person repents and believes in Jesus Christ, they are loved by God ([Romans 5:8](https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/5/Romans-5-8.html)). God sacrificed His Son for all, showing His love for humanity. However, those who reject God's love, refuse to repent, and persistently cling to their sin will face judgment. These are the "wicked" whom God hates—those who persist in their rebellion against Him.

### The Contrast between the Righteous and the Wicked

The Bible often contrasts the righteous, those who take refuge in God, with the wicked, those who rebel against Him. [Psalm 5:4](https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/5/Psalm-5-4.html) emphasizes that God does not delight in wickedness, while verse 11 highlights that those who take refuge in Him will be glad and sing for joy. The righteous and the wicked make different choices and have different destinies. The righteous will experience the ultimate expression of God's love, while the wicked will face the ultimate expression of His hatred.

### Perfect Love and Perfect Hatred

As humans, we cannot love or hate perfectly because we are flawed by sin. However, God can both love and hate perfectly because He is God. His love is untainted by sin, and His hatred is always just and holy. God can hate the sinner in a perfectly holy way while still offering forgiveness to those who repent and have faith in Christ.

### Why This Matters

Understanding God's love and hatred is important for our relationship with Him. Recognizing that God hates sin and wickedness helps us understand the seriousness of our own sin and the need for repentance. It also highlights the incredible depth of God's love, as He sent His Son to save us from the consequences of our sin.

### Think About It

1. Do you find it challenging to reconcile the concept of a loving God with the idea that He also hates certain things? How does understanding that God's hatred arises from His concern for what is good and just affect your perspective?
2. Reflect on the contrast between the righteous and the wicked. How does knowing that our choices determine our destiny impact your daily life?
3. Consider the significance of God's perfect love and perfect hatred. How does this shape your understanding of His character and His desire for a relationship with you?

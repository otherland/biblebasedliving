## Subordination within the Trinity

The concept of subordination within the Trinity may seem confusing at first. After all, Jesus and the Father are described as being "one" in the Bible ([John 10:30](https://www.bibleref.com/John/10/John-10-30.html)). However, it is important to understand that there are different types of subordination when discussing the triune nature of God.

### Equal in Nature

First and foremost, it is crucial to recognize that all three Persons of the Trinity—God the Father, Jesus the Son, and the Holy Spirit—are equal in nature. They share the same divine attributes and possess the same divine nature. This means that there is no difference in essence between them. The Trinity is not composed of greater and lesser gods; rather, there is one God existing eternally in three co-equal Persons.

### Economic Subordination

While there is no ontological subordination (difference in essence) within the Trinity, there is what theologians refer to as economic (or relational) subordination. This form of subordination refers to the roles or activities that each Person of the Trinity voluntarily submits to in relation to creation and salvation.

For instance, we see in Scripture that the Father sent the Son into the world ([1 John 4:10](https://www.bibleref.com/1-John/4/1-John-4-10.html)). This sending does not imply a lower rank or subservient position but highlights the distinct role that each Person plays. The Son willingly submits to this role in obedience to the Father. Similarly, Jesus perfectly submitted His will to the Father's will ([Luke 22:42](https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/22/Luke-22-42.html); [Hebrews 10:7](https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/10/Hebrews-10-7.html)).

The Holy Spirit is also sent by Jesus and "proceeds from the Father" ([John 14:26](https://www.bibleref.com/John/14/John-14-26.html); 15:26). The Spirit testifies of Christ and His work. These roles are never reversed or interchangeable. Each Person of the Trinity has specific responsibilities within creation and salvation, highlighting their relational subordination.

### An Analogy

To better understand this concept of economic subordination, we can consider an analogy. Imagine a team of three individuals working together on a project. Each member has a unique role to play in achieving the project's goals. While they are all equal in value and importance, each person has different responsibilities and tasks. In this analogy, the team members voluntarily submit to one another's roles for the successful completion of the project. Similarly, within the Trinity, each Person voluntarily submits to one another's roles for the fulfillment of God's purposes.

### Why This Matters

Understanding the concept of subordination within the Trinity is essential for several reasons. Firstly, it helps us grasp the nature of God more fully. While He is one God, He exists eternally in three Persons who are equal in essence yet distinct in their roles. This understanding enriches our knowledge of who God is and how He relates to us.

Secondly, it safeguards against heretical views that suggest a hierarchy or inequality within the Trinity. The orthodox Christian view affirms that all three Persons are fully God and equal in nature. They are not separate gods or lesser beings.

Lastly, comprehending subordination within the Trinity sheds light on our own lives as followers of Christ. It reminds us of the importance of submission and obedience to God's will. Just as Jesus submitted Himself to the Father's will, we are called to submit ourselves to God's plan and purpose for our lives.

### Think About It

1. How does understanding subordination within the Trinity deepen your appreciation for God's love and work in your life?
2. Consider how the concept of submission within the Trinity can influence your relationships with others. How can you emulate Christ's submission in your interactions with others?
3. Reflect on the implications of subordination within the Trinity for your understanding of God's sovereignty and plan for redemption.

In summary, while there is no ontological subordination within the Trinity, there is an economic or relational subordination. This means that each Person of the Trinity voluntarily submits to specific roles and responsibilities for the purposes of creation and salvation. It is crucial to recognize that all three Persons are equal in nature, sharing the same divine attributes. Understanding this concept helps us appreciate the nature of God more fully and encourages us to emulate Christ's submission in our own lives.

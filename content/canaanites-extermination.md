## Canaanites Extermination

The extermination of the Canaanites by the Israelites is a topic that raises difficult questions and challenges our understanding of God's character. In order to fully grasp the reasoning behind this command, it is important to examine the biblical context and the reasons given in Scripture. While we may not fully comprehend God's ways, we can seek to understand His purposes as revealed in His Word.

### The Wickedness of the Canaanites

One reason given in Scripture for the extermination of the Canaanites is their extreme wickedness. The Canaanite culture was marked by heinous sins and abominable practices, including incest, child sacrifice, homosexuality, and bestiality. Leviticus 18 provides a list of these sins that Israel was commanded to avoid at all costs. The land itself had become defiled by the sinful practices of its inhabitants. In ordering the destruction of the Canaanites, God enacted a form of corporate capital punishment on a people that had been deserving of judgment for some time.

### Preventing Idolatry and Compromise

Another reason for the extermination of the Canaanites was to prevent religious compromise and spiritual adultery. God warned that if the Israelites left survivors among the Canaanites, they would be led astray and tempted to follow their detestable practices. The Israelites were prone to compromise with Canaanite culture and fell into idolatry time and again. By completely eradicating the Canaanite nations, God sought to protect His relationship with His chosen people and guard them from spiritual harm.

### Future Problems Averted

God's knowledge of the future played a role in His command to exterminate certain people groups. He knew that if Israel did not completely eradicate their enemies, there would be future problems. The Amalekites, although not Canaanites themselves, attacked Israel multiple times and formed alliances with the Canaanites. King Saul was given the responsibility to exterminate the Amalekites, but he failed to fully obey God's command. As a result, several decades later, the Amalekites were able to take captives from David and his men. Furthermore, a descendant of the Amalekites, Haman, sought to exterminate the entire Jewish people in the time of Esther. The incomplete obedience of Saul almost resulted in Israel's destruction. God's command to eliminate these groups was intended to prevent future harm and preserve the well-being of His people.

### Fulfillment of a Curse

Centuries before the command to exterminate the Canaanites, Noah had pronounced a curse on one of Ham's sons, Canaan. This curse declared that Canaan would be the lowest of slaves to his brothers. Canaan was the ancestor of the Canaanite people. When Joshua led the Israelites into Canaan, they conquered the Canaanite nations as part of their inheritance. Not all of the Canaanites were exterminated; some became slaves as Noah's prophecy was fulfilled.

### Understanding Difficult Aspects

One of the most challenging aspects of God's command to exterminate the Canaanites is that women and children were not spared. It is crucial to approach this issue with care and consider several points:

1. No one is innately innocent or sinless. Scripture teaches that all have sinned and fallen short of God's glory ([Psalm 51:5](https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/51/Psalm-51-5.html); 58:3). The women and children in Canaan were participants in the sinful practices of their culture, and allowing them to live would have perpetuated those practices.

2. The children would have grown up sympathetic to evil religions and practices. By eliminating them, God prevented future generations from continuing in the same wickedness.

3. These children would have likely harbored resentment toward the Israelites and sought revenge for the perceived injustice against their fathers. This would have perpetuated a cycle of violence and hostility.

Although we may struggle to fully comprehend God's actions, we must recognize His sovereignty over all life. He alone has the right to give and take life, and how and when we die is ultimately up to Him. In the case of the Canaanites, God had given them ample time to repent, but they remained resistant to Him. Their destruction served as a form of judgment for their persistent wickedness.

### Why This Matters

The extermination of the Canaanites raises significant theological questions about God's character and His dealings with humanity. Understanding the reasons behind this command can help us grapple with these difficult questions and deepen our trust in God's wisdom and justice.

### Think About It

1. How does the wickedness of the Canaanites challenge our understanding of God's grace and mercy?

2. What lessons can we learn from God's command to exterminate the Canaanites about the seriousness of sin and the need for repentance?

3. How does God's role as judge reflect His commitment to righteousness and justice?

4. How can we reconcile the command to exterminate the Canaanites with the biblical teaching on love, compassion, and forgiveness?

5. In what ways can we apply the lessons from this biblical account to our own lives today?

## God's Desire for Worship

The concept of God demanding worship raises important questions about His nature and our role as human beings created in His image. While it may seem that God seeks worship to boost His self-esteem or gain emotional support, a closer examination of Scripture reveals a deeper understanding.

### The Nature of God

To understand why God demands worship, we must first recognize His nature. According to the Bible, God is the Creator and Sustainer of the entire universe. He is eternal, infinite, and self-existing, needing nothing outside of Himself to maintain His existence. In contrast, human beings require various things like air, water, food, and sleep to survive.

Furthermore, God is described as light, love, and life. He is the true source of these foundational realities. We are fully dependent on Him for our existence and sustenance. In fact, the apostle Paul stated that in God we "live, move, and have our being" ([Acts 17:28](https://www.bibleref.com/Acts/17/Acts-17-28.html)). God provides us with every good and perfect gift.

### The Benefits of Worship

God's command to worship Him is not for His own benefit but for ours. Since God is love itself ([1 John 4:8](https://www.bibleref.com/1-John/4/1-John-4-8.html)) and His love toward us is the highest form of love, worshiping Him works out for our benefit. The act of worship aligns our hearts and lives around what is truly valuable and worthy.

Without assigning ultimate worth to God, we would esteem something else as ultimately valuable. However, everything in this world is temporary and perishing. They are unable to provide us with real and eternal light, love, and life. Giving ourselves to these temporary things will eventually lead to ruin.

God desires worship because He knows that our ultimate well-being lies in knowing Him and having a personal relationship with Him. He is the only true and living God, the source of all good things. True worship recalibrates our hearts and enables us to love God and others rightly. It fills us with gratitude and empowers us to live purposefully for God's glory.

### Why This Matters

Understanding God's desire for worship helps us grasp the significance of our relationship with Him. It reminds us that we were designed to worship. If we fail to worship God, we will end up worshiping something elseâ€”an idol of our own making, something temporary and perishing.

Recognizing the importance of worship allows us to prioritize our lives correctly. It helps us avoid investing our time, energy, and resources in things that cannot truly fulfill us. By worshiping the true and living God, we align ourselves with what is ultimate and experience the benefits of a deep and meaningful relationship with Him.

### Think About It

1. How does worshiping God affect your perspective on what is truly valuable in life?
2. Consider the temporary nature of worldly pursuits. How does this impact your priorities?
3. Reflect on the benefits of knowing and worshiping the Creator of all things. How can you cultivate a lifestyle of worship?

## Accommodation and Condescension: Understanding God's Communication

In theology, the concepts of accommodation and condescension refer to how an infinitely perfect God communicates with imperfect and finite humans. The idea behind condescension is that God chooses to communicate in a way that His audience can understand. Throughout history, many theologians have used the concept of accommodation to explain how God relates to His creation.

### The Essence of Accommodation

Accommodation is the theological viewpoint that God adapts His communication to meet the limitations of human knowledge and understanding. It is through accommodation that God reveals Himself, using human languages, authors, and natural phenomena to make Himself known to us. For example, anthropomorphisms in the Bible, which describe God in human terms, are seen as a form of accommodation. While God is spirit ([John 4:24](https://www.bibleref.com/John/4/John-4-24.html)), He uses anthropomorphic language to help us grasp His actions and emotions.

### The Spectrum of Accommodation

Different theologians have varying perspectives on the extent of accommodation. However, nearly all agree that some form of accommodation is necessary for an infinite God to communicate with finite humanity. Accommodation allows God to reveal Himself in a manner that we can comprehend. Nevertheless, there are those who take the concept of accommodation to an extreme, arguing that certain aspects of the Bible should be discarded because they reflect outdated or untrue notions. This view uses accommodation as a means to dismiss biblical statements of morality or reality that may make certain audiences uncomfortable.

### Jesus and Accommodation

Some argue that Jesus also employed accommodation in His teachings. For instance, when Jesus referred to Moses as the author of the Torah ([Mark 10:5](https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/10/Mark-10-5.html); [John 5:46](https://www.bibleref.com/John/5/John-5-46.html)), it is suggested that He was accommodating the prevailing belief of that time, even though He knew Moses did not literally write the entire law. However, it is important to note that Jesus, being fully God and fully man, would never accommodate a false view by intentionally deceiving His listeners. Such an act would contradict His holy nature.

### The Proper View of Accommodation

The proper view of accommodation, as defined by theologian Gregg Allison, is that it is "God's act of condescending to human capacity in His revelation of Himself." This understanding emphasizes God's adjustment of His communication to make it intelligible to humanity. It is akin to a parent stooping down to communicate with a child. God's accommodation is seen throughout Scripture, where He reveals Himself through human languages and limited human understanding. Importantly, God's accommodation does not involve participating in human error or deception.

### The Significance of Accommodation

Accommodation demonstrates God's omniscience, omnipotence, and His deep love and care for His creatures. By choosing to communicate with us in ways we can understand, God reveals His desire for a relationship with humanity. It shows His willingness to meet us where we are and guide us towards a deeper understanding of Him. The concept of accommodation reminds us of the incredible lengths God goes to reveal Himself to us.

**Why This Matters:** Understanding the concept of accommodation helps us appreciate the depth of God's love and care for us. It shows that God is not distant or unapproachable but rather desires to communicate with us in ways we can comprehend. Recognizing accommodation also helps us interpret Scripture correctly, acknowledging both the divine inspiration behind it and the human context in which it was written.

**Think About It:** Consider how God's accommodation impacts your understanding of Scripture. Does it change the way you approach certain passages or teachings? How does recognizing God's accommodation influence your perception of His character and His desire to communicate with you?

In conclusion, accommodation is a theological concept that explains how an infinite God communicates with finite humanity. It is through accommodation that God reveals Himself in ways we can understand. While different perspectives exist regarding the extent of accommodation, it is universally accepted that some form of accommodation is necessary for God to communicate with us. Understanding accommodation helps us appreciate God's love and care for us, as well as interpret Scripture in its proper context.

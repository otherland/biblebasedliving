## God is Spirit

The Bible teaches us that "God is spirit" ([John 4:24](https://www.bibleref.com/John/4/John-4-24.html)). This statement was made by Jesus to a woman who had questions about the proper way to worship God. It means that God the Father does not have a human body like we do. While Jesus, as the Son of God, came to earth in human form, God the Father did not take on a physical body.

It is important to note that when the Bible sometimes speaks of God using terms like "hand," "ear," or "eyes," it is using anthropomorphism—a figurative language technique that describes God in terms humans can better understand. These descriptions should not be taken literally but rather help us comprehend certain aspects of God's character.

Saying that God is spirit also means that He is invisible. [Colossians 1:15](https://www.bibleref.com/Colossians/1/Colossians-1-15.html) refers to Him as the "invisible God," and [1 Timothy 1:17](https://www.bibleref.com/1-Timothy/1/1-Timothy-1-17.html) praises Him as the "immortal, invisible, the only God." Although God is spirit and invisible, He is a living and personal being. We can have a personal relationship with Him and know Him intimately.

## The Nature of God

God being spirit is essential for understanding His nature. If God had a physical body, He would be limited by time and space. However, as a spirit, He transcends these limitations and can exist in all places simultaneously. This concept helps us grasp His omnipresence—His ability to be present everywhere at once.

Moreover, God's spiritual nature allows us to understand His infiniteness. Being infinite means that there are no restrictions or boundaries on His existence. If God had a physical body, He would be limited in some way. But as a spirit, He is limitless and unbound by any physical or created constraints.

## Worshiping in Spirit and Truth

Jesus connects the fact that God is spirit with the idea of worshiping Him in spirit and truth. Worshiping in spirit means that we engage with God from the depths of our soul, with our heart and mind fully dedicated to Him. It is a worship that goes beyond external rituals and traditions.

Worshiping in truth means worshiping God accurately—the way He has revealed Himself to us through His Word, the Bible. It involves aligning our beliefs and practices with the truth found in Scripture and not relying solely on our own opinions or preferences.

## Why This Matters

Understanding that God is spirit helps us grasp the nature of our relationship with Him. It reminds us that He is not confined to a physical form, but rather a living and personal being who desires to have a genuine connection with us. Recognizing His invisibility also encourages us to seek Him with faith and trust rather than relying solely on what we can see or understand.

Recognizing that God is spirit also invites us into a deeper understanding of worship. It challenges us to move beyond outward expressions and rituals and instead approach worship with authenticity, sincerity, and reverence. Worshiping in spirit and truth enables us to cultivate a meaningful relationship with God and experience His presence in our lives.

Title: Is God Selfish? Unveiling the Divine Compassion in Christianity
---

## Is God Selfish?

We often hear the question of whether God is selfish or egotistical. While the Bible does not directly address this question, it is important to examine it from a biblical perspective. Accusations of God's selfishness often arise from individuals who do not believe in God or who use it as an argument against the goodness of God as presented in the Bible.

### God's Perfect Being

God is the only perfect being in the entire universe, and any attention, praise, and adoration directed towards Him is completely warranted. Accusing God of selfishness stems from our own desire to occupy the place that rightfully belongs to God. It is our own selfishness that allows us to accuse God of selfishness. 

### God's Self-Sufficiency

God was completely self-sufficient and had no need to create other beings in order to find fulfillment. Within the Trinity, there existed perfect love and fellowship. The only reason God created human beings is so that we may also experience His love and perfection. Comparing God's alleged selfishness to that of a child accusing his parents of being selfish because they refuse to buy him all the toys he wants helps put things into perspective.

### Glorifying God and Enjoying Him Forever

The Westminster Catechism summarizes humanity’s purpose as "to glorify God and enjoy Him forever." By submitting to and glorifying God, we also benefit immeasurably and find the purpose for which we were created. It may seem more generous if God gave people happiness whether or not they wanted a relationship with Him, but C.S. Lewis explains that true happiness can only be found in a relationship with God. 

### Our Rebellion Against God

By nature, we do not want to submit to God and often seek to banish Him from our lives so that we can maintain control and be gods unto ourselves. Despite our rebellion, God demonstrated His love for us by sending Jesus Christ to die for our sins. It is through God's selflessness that we are able to receive forgiveness.

## Why This Matters

Understanding whether God is selfish or not is crucial as it shapes our perception of His character and actions. Accusing God of selfishness can lead to a distorted view of who He truly is. Recognizing God's self-sufficiency and perfect being helps us realize that any attention directed towards Him is warranted. Additionally, grasping the purpose of glorifying God and enjoying Him forever enables us to find true fulfillment in life.

## Think About It

1. Reflect on your own desires and motivations. Are there areas where you may be projecting your own selfishness onto God?
2. Consider the concept of finding true happiness in a relationship with God. How does this challenge your understanding of happiness?
3. In what ways can you actively submit to and glorify God in your daily life? How might this impact your overall perspective and sense of fulfillment?

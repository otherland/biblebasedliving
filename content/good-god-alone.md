## Good Alone: Understanding Jesus' Claim to Divinity

### Introduction

In the Gospel of Mark, there is a passage that has been sometimes misunderstood and used to argue against the deity of Christ. In [Mark 10:17-22](https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/10/Mark-10-17.html), Jesus engages in a conversation with a rich young ruler who addresses Him as "Good Teacher." Some claim that Jesus' response denies His divinity. However, upon closer examination, we can see that Jesus is not denying His deity but rather challenging the man to consider the true meaning of goodness and recognize Jesus' divine identity.

### Understanding Jesus' Response

When the young ruler addresses Jesus as "Good Teacher," Jesus responds with a question, "Why do you call me good? No one is good except God alone" ([Mark 10:18](https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/10/Mark-10-18.html)). Jesus is not rebuking the man for calling Him good; rather, He is prompting him to consider the implications of his own words. Jesus wants the man to understand what it truly means for someone to be good and recognize his own lack of goodness.

Jesus' question highlights that goodness does not originate from human deeds but from God Himself. The young ruler had devoted himself to keeping the commandments, yet he failed to prioritize the greatest commandment—to love God above all else ([Matthew 22:37-38](https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/22/Matthew-22-37.html)). The man's attachment to his riches revealed that he valued them more than God, thus falling short of true goodness in God's eyes.

### Following Christ: The Path to Goodness

Jesus uses this encounter to teach an important lesson about goodness. He invites the man to follow Him, emphasizing that true goodness can only be achieved by aligning oneself with God's ultimate standard. Following Jesus means being willing to give up everything and putting God first. By distinguishing between man's standard of goodness and God's standard, Jesus reveals that following Him is a manifestation of true goodness.

The command to follow Christ is a proclamation of Jesus' own goodness. By accepting the call to follow Him, one acknowledges Jesus' divine identity. This interpretation aligns with passages such as [John 10:11](https://www.bibleref.com/John/10/John-10-11.html), where Jesus refers to Himself as the "good shepherd." Furthermore, in [John 8:46](https://www.bibleref.com/John/8/John-8-46.html), Jesus challenges anyone to prove Him guilty of sin—a challenge that cannot be met since Jesus was without sin, holy, and undefiled.

### The Logic of Jesus' Claim to Divinity

We can summarize the logic behind Jesus' claim to divinity as follows:

1. Jesus asserts that only God is good.
2. Jesus claims to be good.
3. Therefore, Jesus is implicitly claiming to be God.

This reasoning makes sense when we consider the overall narrative in Mark's gospel, which gradually reveals Jesus' true identity. It is only before the high priest in [Mark 14:62](https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/14/Mark-14-62.html) that Jesus' identity is explicitly clarified. The story of the rich young ruler is part of a sequence of stories designed to point readers towards the understanding that Jesus is the eternal, divine, incarnate Son of God.

### Why This Matters

Understanding Jesus' claim to divinity has significant implications for our faith. Jesus' divinity is a foundational belief in Christianity. By recognizing His divine nature, we affirm His authority and the unique salvation He offers. It also shapes our understanding of what it means to follow Christ and strive for true goodness in our lives.

### Think About It

Jesus' question to the rich young ruler challenges us as well. Are we willing to evaluate our own understanding of goodness? Do we prioritize God above all else? Reflecting on these questions can help us deepen our relationship with God and align our lives with His standards of goodness.

In conclusion, while some may interpret Jesus' response to the rich young ruler as a denial of His divinity, a closer examination reveals that He is actually prompting the man to consider true goodness and recognize Jesus' divine identity. By accepting the call to follow Him, we acknowledge Jesus' claim to be the embodiment of goodness and implicitly affirm His deity. This understanding is crucial for our faith and shapes our understanding of what it means to be a follower of Christ.

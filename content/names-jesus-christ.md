## Names of Jesus Christ

Throughout the Bible, there are numerous names and titles given to Jesus Christ, each revealing different aspects of His nature, position, and work. These names provide us with a deeper understanding of who Jesus is and what He accomplished on earth for our salvation. Let's explore some of the prominent names of Jesus and their significance.

### Chief Cornerstone

[Ephesians 2:20](https://www.bibleref.com/Ephesians/2/Ephesians-2-20.html) describes Jesus as the "Chief Cornerstone" of the church. Just as a cornerstone holds a building together, Jesus cements together believers from all backgrounds into one structure built on faith in Him. This name emphasizes His role in unifying all believers into one body.

### Firstborn over all creation

[Colossians 1:15](https://www.bibleref.com/Colossians/1/Colossians-1-15.html) refers to Jesus as the "Firstborn over all creation." This does not mean that He was the first thing God created, but rather that He holds the rank and pre-eminence over all things. Jesus is the highest authority and occupies the most exalted position in the universe.

### Head of the Church

In [Ephesians 1:22](https://www.bibleref.com/Ephesians/1/Ephesians-1-22.html) and other passages, Jesus is described as the "Head of the Church." This title affirms that Jesus is the supreme ruler of the Church. Unlike earthly kings or popes, He alone has authority over those who have placed their faith in Him for salvation.

### Holy One

Jesus is referred to as the "Holy One" in [Acts 3:14](https://www.bibleref.com/Acts/3/Acts-3-14.html) and other verses. This name signifies His holiness in both His divine and human nature. Through His death, we are made holy and pure before God.

### Judge

[Acts 10:42](https://www.bibleref.com/Acts/10/Acts-10-42.html) and [2 Timothy 4:8](https://www.bibleref.com/2-Timothy/4/2-Timothy-4-8.html) describe Jesus as the appointed Judge of the world. He will dispense rewards and judgment. This highlights His authority to judge all people according to their actions and faith.

### King of kings and Lord of lords

In [1 Timothy 6:15](https://www.bibleref.com/1-Timothy/6/1-Timothy-6-15.html) and [Revelation 19:16](https://www.bibleref.com/Revelation/19/Revelation-19-16.html), Jesus is titled the "King of kings and Lord of lords." This means that Jesus has dominion over all authority on earth, including kings and rulers. No one can prevent Him from accomplishing His purposes.

### Light of the World

Jesus proclaimed Himself as the "Light of the World" in [John 8:12](https://www.bibleref.com/John/8/John-8-12.html). He came into a world darkened by sin to shed light and truth through His work and teachings. Those who trust in Him have their eyes opened to the truth and walk in the light.

### Prince of Peace

[Isaiah 9:6](https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/9/Isaiah-9-6.html) calls Jesus the "Prince of Peace." This does not mean that He came to bring peace to the world in the absence of war, but rather to reconcile humanity with God. Through His death, Jesus brings peace between God and mankind, ending the separation caused by sin.

### Son of God

The title "Son of God" affirms the deity of Christ. [Luke 1:35](https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/1/Luke-1-35.html) and [John 1:49](https://www.bibleref.com/John/1/John-1-49.html) refer to Jesus as the "only begotten of the Father" ([John 1:14](https://www.bibleref.com/John/1/John-1-14.html)). This name emphasizes His divine nature and highlights His unique relationship with God.

### Son of Man

The phrase "Son of Man" emphasizes both the humanity and messianic role of Jesus. It is used in [John 5:27](https://www.bibleref.com/John/5/John-5-27.html) and [Mark 14:63](https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/14/Mark-14-63.html). This title signifies that Jesus is fully human while also being divine.

This name denotes that Jesus is the second person of the triune God, who spoke all things into existence during creation. He is co-eternal with God the Father.

### Word of God

[Revelation 19:12-13](https://www.bibleref.com/Revelation/19/Revelation-19-12.html) mentions a name given to Christ that only He knows. This name is the "Word of God." It represents the mysterious nature of His divine person and His role as the source of eternal life.

### Word of Life

In [1 John 1:1](https://www.bibleref.com/1-John/1/1-John-1-1.html), Jesus is described as the "Word of Life." This means that Jesus not only spoke words that lead to eternal life but is Himself the embodiment of life. Through Him, we receive the eternal life of joy and fulfillment.

### Alpha and Omega

Jesus declared Himself to be the "Alpha and Omega" in [Revelation 1:8](https://www.bibleref.com/Revelation/1/Revelation-1-8.html) and 22:13. This title signifies that He is the beginning and end of all things. Only the true God can claim this statement of eternality.

### Emmanuel

The name "Emmanuel," meaning "God with us," is mentioned in [Isaiah 9:6](https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/9/Isaiah-9-6.html) and [Matthew 1:23](https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/1/Matthew-1-23.html). It affirms that Jesus, born in Bethlehem, is God Himself who came to earth in human form to live among His people.

### I Am

In [John 8:58](https://www.bibleref.com/John/8/John-8-58.html), Jesus ascribed to Himself the title "I Am." This declaration led the Jews to try to stone Him for blasphemy because they understood that He was declaring Himself to be the eternal God, the unchanging Yahweh of the Old Testament.

### Lord of All

[Acts 10:36](https://www.bibleref.com/Acts/10/Acts-10-36.html) proclaims Jesus as the "Lord of All." This title highlights His sovereignty over the entire world, all nations, and especially those whom God has chosen as His peopleâ€”both Jews and Gentiles.

### True God

In [1 John 5:20](https://www.bibleref.com/1-John/5/1-John-5-20.html), Jesus is described as the "True God." This assertion affirms His divinity and declares Him to be the one and only true God. It reinforces the biblical teaching that there is only one God.

### Author and Perfecter of our Faith

[Hebrews 12:2](https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/12/Hebrews-12-2.html) refers to Jesus as the "Author and Perfecter of our Faith." This means that Jesus is the founder and sustainer of our faith. He is the source of our salvation and the one who brings it to completion.

### Bread of Life

In [John 6:35](https://www.bibleref.com/John/6/John-6-35.html) and 6:48, Jesus calls Himself the "Bread of Life." Just as physical bread sustains life, Jesus is the spiritual bread that gives and sustains eternal life. He provides nourishment and salvation through His body, broken for us.

### Bridegroom

[Matthew 9:15](https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/9/Matthew-9-15.html) presents Jesus as the "Bridegroom." This imagery portrays the special relationship between Christ and the Church. Believers are bound to Him in a covenant of grace that cannot be broken.

### Deliverer

[Romans 11:26](https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/11/Romans-11-26.html) describes Jesus as our "Deliverer." Just as God delivered the Israelites from bondage in Egypt, Jesus is our deliverer from the bondage of sin. He sets us free and brings us into a new life.

### Good Shepherd

In [John 10:11](https://www.bibleref.com/John/10/John-10-11.html) and 10:14, Jesus refers to Himself as the "Good Shepherd." This title draws on the analogy of a shepherd who cares for and protects his sheep. Jesus laid down His life for His sheep, demonstrating His love and care for us.

### High Priest

[Hebrews 2:17](https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/2/Hebrews-2-17.html) describes Jesus as the "High Priest." In Jewish tradition, the high priest would make atonement for the sins of the people once a year. Jesus fulfilled this role once and for all through His sacrifice on the cross.

### Lamb of God

[John 1:29](https://www.bibleref.com/John/1/John-1-29.html) presents Jesus as the "Lamb of God." In Old Testament law, a spotless lamb was sacrificed to atone for sin. Jesus became that sacrificial Lamb, willingly giving His life to take away our sins.

### Mediator

[1 Timothy 2:5](https://www.bibleref.com/1-Timothy/2/1-Timothy-2-5.html) refers to Jesus as the "Mediator" between God and humanity. As a mediator, Jesus reconciles us with God. He is the one and only Mediator, and praying to anyone else bypasses His crucial role.

### Rock

In [1 Corinthians 10:4](https://www.bibleref.com/1-Corinthians/10/1-Corinthians-10-4.html), Jesus is likened to a "Rock." Just as water flowed from the rock Moses struck in the wilderness, Jesus is the spiritual Rock from which flows the living waters of eternal life. He is the foundation upon which we build our lives.

### Resurrection and Life

[John 11:25](https://www.bibleref.com/John/11/John-11-25.html) reveals Jesus as the "Resurrection and Life." Through His death and resurrection, Jesus has the power to resurrect sinners to eternal life. Our old selves are buried with Him, and we are raised to walk in newness of life.

### Savior

[Matthew 1:21](https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/1/Matthew-1-21.html) and [Luke 2:11](https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/2/Luke-2-11.html) proclaim Jesus as the "Savior." He saves us by dying to redeem us, giving us the Holy Spirit for renewal, empowering us to overcome spiritual enemies, sustaining us in trials and even death, and raising us up on the last day.

### True Vine

In [John 15:1](https://www.bibleref.com/John/15/John-15-1.html), Jesus describes Himself as the "True Vine." Just as branches draw nourishment from a vine, believers find their sustenance in Jesus. He provides the living water of salvation and nourishment through His Word.

### Way, Truth, Life

Jesus declares Himself to be the "Way, Truth, and Life" in [John 14:6](https://www.bibleref.com/John/14/John-14-6.html). He is the exclusive path to God, the embodiment of truth in a world filled with lies, and the true source of eternal life. In Him, we find ultimate meaning and purpose.

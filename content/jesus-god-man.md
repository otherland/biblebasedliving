## Jesus: Fully God and Fully Man

The Bible teaches that Jesus Christ is both fully God and fully man. This concept may seem confusing, but the Council of Chalcedon in AD 451 affirmed the truth that Jesus is "the same perfect in divinity and perfect in humanity, the same truly God and truly man." This declaration aligns with what the Bible teaches on the subject. Scriptures clearly state that Jesus is God ([John 20:28](https://www.bibleref.com/John/20/John-20-28.html); [Titus 2:13](https://www.bibleref.com/Titus/2/Titus-2-13.html); [Hebrews 1:8](https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/1/Hebrews-1-8.html)) and also emphasize His true humanity ([Romans 1:2](https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/1/Romans-1-2.html)–4; [1 John 4:2](https://www.bibleref.com/1-John/4/1-John-4-2.html)–3).

It is important to understand the significance of Jesus being both God and man. The apostle Paul wrote that affirming the divinity of Jesus is necessary for salvation ([Romans 10:9](https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/10/Romans-10-9.html)). Additionally, the apostle John warned that denying Christ's true humanity promotes the doctrine of antichrist ([2 John 1:7](https://www.bibleref.com/2-John/1/2-John-1-7.html)). Therefore, recognizing Jesus as both fully God and fully man is crucial to our Christian faith.

### The Incarnation: God Becomes Man

The triune God, consisting of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, has existed from all eternity. At a specific point in time, God the Son took on human flesh ([Luke 1:35](https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/1/Luke-1-35.html); [Hebrews 1:5](https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/1/Hebrews-1-5.html)). This act is known as the Incarnation. In this miraculous event, God the Son added a sinless human nature to His eternally existent divine nature. The result was Jesus Christ—the Word made flesh ([John 1:1](https://www.bibleref.com/John/1/John-1-1.html), 14).

Jesus' purpose in becoming fully human was twofold. First, He came to be a merciful and faithful high priest in service to God ([Hebrews 2:17](https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/2/Hebrews-2-17.html)). By being fully human, Jesus could sympathize with our weaknesses and represent us before God. Second, Jesus came to make atonement for the sins of the people ([Hebrews 2:17](https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/2/Hebrews-2-17.html)). As a sinless human, He became the perfect sacrifice to provide redemption to all who believe ([Galatians 4:4](https://www.bibleref.com/Galatians/4/Galatians-4-4.html)–5).

### The Dual Nature of Jesus

Throughout His earthly life, Jesus never ceased to be God. Even though He became fully human, His divine nature remained intact ([Luke 6:5](https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/6/Luke-6-5.html), 8). On the other hand, after the Incarnation, Jesus has never ceased to be human. The apostle Paul states that Jesus is the one mediator between God and humanity ([1 Timothy 2:5](https://www.bibleref.com/1-Timothy/2/1-Timothy-2-5.html)). He is not half-human and half-divine but rather the God-man—fully God and fully man.

The dual nature of Jesus is a profound mystery. It means that while Jesus had all the attributes of deity, such as being all-knowing, all-powerful, and eternal, He also experienced humanity's limitations and emotions. Jesus displayed weaknesses and vulnerabilities common to humanity, such as hunger, thirst, and sadness ([Luke 19:41](https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/19/Luke-19-41.html); [John 19:28](https://www.bibleref.com/John/19/John-19-28.html)). This unique combination of divinity and humanity allows Jesus to perfectly fulfill His role as our Savior and High Priest.

### Why This Matters

Understanding the dual nature of Jesus has significant implications for our faith. It assures us that Jesus is uniquely qualified to represent us before God because He knows firsthand what it means to be human. We can approach Him with confidence, knowing that He sympathizes with our weaknesses ([Hebrews 4:15](https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/4/Hebrews-4-15.html)).

Furthermore, recognizing Jesus as both fully God and fully man affirms His ability to provide salvation for humanity. As a sinless human, He could offer Himself as the perfect sacrifice for our sins. Through faith in Him, we can receive forgiveness and eternal life.

### Think About It

Contemplating the dual nature of Jesus can lead us to a deeper appreciation of His love and sacrifice. As we reflect on His divinity, we are reminded of the magnitude of His power and authority. At the same time, pondering His humanity helps us grasp the depth of His love and compassion for us.

Consider the incredible humility it took for God to become a human being. Jesus willingly set aside the privileges and glory of His divine nature to identify with us in our brokenness. This demonstrates His immense love for us and serves as an example for how we should love and serve others.

In conclusion, Jesus Christ is both fully God and fully man. The Council of Chalcedon's declaration based on biblical teachings affirms this truth. The Incarnation—the act of God becoming man—allows Jesus to be our merciful High Priest and provide atonement for our sins. Recognizing the dual nature of Jesus is central to our faith and allows us to approach Him with confidence and receive salvation through Him. Let us marvel at the mystery of the God-man and strive to follow His example of love and humility.

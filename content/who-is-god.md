## Who is God?

### Introduction

The existence of God is evident in both creation and the human conscience, as stated in [Psalm 14:1](https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/14/Psalm-14-1.html). Therefore, the Bible does not attempt to prove God's existence but assumes it from the beginning ([Genesis 1:1](https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/1/Genesis-1-1.html)). Instead, the Bible reveals God's nature, character, and work. It is crucial to have a correct understanding of God because false ideas about Him lead to idolatry. In simple terms, God can be defined as the Supreme Being, the Creator and Ruler of all things, and the Self-existent One who is perfect in power, goodness, and wisdom.

### Characteristics of God

1. **God's Spiritual Nature**: God is a spirit and cannot be physically perceived ([John 4:24](https://www.bibleref.com/John/4/John-4-24.html)). This means that He does not have a physical body like humans do.

2. **The Trinity**: While God is One, He exists as three distinct Persons - God the Father, God the Son (Jesus Christ), and God the Holy Spirit ([Matthew 3:16-17](https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/3/Matthew-3-16.html)). This concept is difficult to fully comprehend but can be understood through an analogy of water existing in three forms: solid (ice), liquid (water), and gas (steam). Although different forms, they are all H2O.

3. **God's Attributes**: God possesses various attributes that define His nature. Some of these include:

   - **Infinite**: God has no limits or boundaries ([1 Timothy 1:17](https://www.bibleref.com/1-Timothy/1/1-Timothy-1-17.html)).
   - **Incomparable**: There is no one like God ([2 Samuel 7:22](https://www.bibleref.com/2-Samuel/7/2-Samuel-7-22.html)).
   - **Unchanging**: God remains the same throughout time ([Malachi 3:6](https://www.bibleref.com/Malachi/3/Malachi-3-6.html)).
   - **Omnipresent**: God exists everywhere simultaneously ([Psalm 139:7-12](https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/139/Psalm-139-7.html)).
   - **Omniscient**: God knows everything ([Psalm 147:5](https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/147/Psalm-147-5.html); [Isaiah 40:28](https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/40/Isaiah-40-28.html)).
   - **All-powerful**: God has all power and authority (Ephesians 1; [Revelation 19:6](https://www.bibleref.com/Revelation/19/Revelation-19-6.html)).

4. **God's Moral Attributes**: God is just, loving, truthful, and holy. He shows compassion, mercy, and grace. He judges sin but also offers forgiveness ([Acts 17:31](https://www.bibleref.com/Acts/17/Acts-17-31.html), [Ephesians 2:4-5](https://www.bibleref.com/Ephesians/2/Ephesians-2-4.html), [John 14:6](https://www.bibleref.com/John/14/John-14-6.html), [1 John 1:5](https://www.bibleref.com/1-John/1/1-John-1-5.html), [2 Corinthians 1:3](https://www.bibleref.com/2-Corinthians/1/2-Corinthians-1-3.html), [Romans 9:15](https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/9/Romans-9-15.html), [Romans 5:17](https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/5/Romans-5-17.html), [Psalm 5:5](https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/5/Psalm-5-5.html), [Psalm 130:4](https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/130/Psalm-130-4.html)).

### Understanding God through His Works

To understand God fully, we must examine His works because what God does flows from who He is.

1. **Creation**: God is the Creator of the world ([Genesis 1:1](https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/1/Genesis-1-1.html)) and everything in it. He brought the universe into existence out of nothing. The complexity and beauty of creation point to God's intelligence and creativity.

2. **Sustenance**: God actively sustains the world by upholding its existence ([Colossians 1:17](https://www.bibleref.com/Colossians/1/Colossians-1-17.html)). Every breath we take and every moment we live is a result of God's sustaining power.

3. **Redemption**: God has an eternal plan that involves redeeming humanity from the curse of sin and death ([Ephesians 1:11](https://www.bibleref.com/Ephesians/1/Ephesians-1-11.html), [Galatians 3:13-14](https://www.bibleref.com/Galatians/3/Galatians-3-13.html)). This plan centers around Jesus Christ, who became incarnate as the Son of Man to bridge the gap between God and humanity ([John 1:14](https://www.bibleref.com/John/1/John-1-14.html)). Through Jesus, we can have forgiveness of sins, reconciliation with God, and eternal salvation ([Ephesians 1:7](https://www.bibleref.com/Ephesians/1/Ephesians-1-7.html), [John 15:15](https://www.bibleref.com/John/15/John-15-15.html), [Romans 5:10](https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/5/Romans-5-10.html), [2 Timothy 2:10](https://www.bibleref.com/2-Timothy/2/2-Timothy-2-10.html)).

4. **Divine Intervention**: God is actively involved in our lives. He draws people to Jesus ([John 6:44](https://www.bibleref.com/John/6/John-6-44.html)), disciplines His children ([Hebrews 12:6](https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/12/Hebrews-12-6.html)), and will judge the world in the future ([Revelation 20:11-15](https://www.bibleref.com/Revelation/20/Revelation-20-11.html)).

### Why This Matters

Understanding who God is and His nature is essential for our faith and relationship with Him. It helps us avoid idolatry and worshiping false gods. Knowing that God is just, loving, merciful, and gracious gives us confidence in His character. Recognizing His power and authority helps us trust that He is in control of all things.

### Think About It

1. How does knowing that God is present everywhere and knows everything impact your daily life?
2. How does understanding God's attributes affect your perspective on difficult situations?
3. In what ways can you apply the knowledge of God's character and works to your relationship with Him?

In conclusion, God is the Supreme Being, the Creator and Ruler of all things, who reveals Himself through creation, conscience, and His Word. He possesses various attributes that define His nature, including being infinite, incomparable, unchanging, omnipresent, omniscient, and all-powerful. God's moral attributes include justice, love, truthfulness, holiness, compassion, mercy, grace, judgment of sin, and forgiveness. Understanding God's works, such as creation, sustenance, redemption through Jesus Christ, and divine intervention, helps us grasp the depth of His love and involvement in our lives. Knowing who God is deepens our faith and relationship with Him.

Title: 'Essential Faith: Understanding God''s Requirement for Believers'
---

## God Requires Faith

Our relationship with God, just like our relationships with others, requires faith. Faith is an integral component of all relationships because we can never fully know another person. We cannot experience everything they experience or fully understand their thoughts and emotions. In the book of Proverbs, it says, "The heart knows its own bitterness, and a stranger does not share its joy" ([Proverbs 14:10](https://www.bibleref.com/Proverbs/14/Proverbs-14-10.html)). Even our own hearts can be deceptive and wicked, making it difficult for us to fully know ourselves.

If we cannot fully know other finite human beings, how can we expect to fully know an infinite God? Even if God desired to fully reveal Himself to us, it would be impossible for us to comprehend Him completely. It would be like trying to pour the vastness of the ocean into a small measuring jar. However, God has revealed enough about Himself through His creation, the Bible, and His Son, Jesus Christ, that we can enter into a meaningful relationship with Him.

To have a relationship with God, we need to trust in Jesus Christ as the payment for our sins. Sin creates a barrier between a holy God and sinful humanity. Jesus, the sinless Son of God, died on the cross to take our punishment and bridge the gap between us and God. By believing in Him, we can become children of God and live eternally in His presence.

Throughout history, there have been instances where God revealed Himself more visibly to people. For example, during the exodus from Egypt, God demonstrated His love and power by sending miraculous plagues upon the Egyptians and parting the Red Sea for the Israelites. He also provided them with food and guided them through a pillar of cloud and fire. However, even with these tangible demonstrations of His presence and care, the Israelites still struggled to trust Him when faced with challenges.

This reveals that further revelation from God would not necessarily increase our ability to trust Him. Our sinful hearts are prone to rebellion and self-rule, as seen in the Israelites' response. The problem lies not in God insufficiently revealing Himself, but in our sinful nature.

God has revealed enough of His nature for us to trust Him. Through history, nature, and Jesus Christ, He has shown that He is all-powerful, all-knowing, all-wise, all-loving, all-holy, unchanging, and eternal. In this revelation, He has proven Himself worthy of our trust. However, the choice to trust Him ultimately rests with us.

To deepen our understanding of God, we should study the Bible carefully. The Bible is God's inerrant Word and provides insights into His character and plan for humanity. By relying on Jesus Christ as our Savior and studying His Word, we can come to know God more intimately and have a close relationship with Him.

### Why This Matters

Understanding the role of faith in our relationship with God is crucial for every Christian. It helps us recognize that faith is not blind or arbitrary but based on the evidence of God's revelation throughout history and in Scripture. Recognizing this can strengthen our trust and reliance on God, even when faced with challenging circumstances or unanswered questions.

### Think About It

1. Reflect on your own relationship with God. How has faith played a role in it?
2. Consider the different ways God has revealed Himself to you personally. How have these revelations deepened your faith?
3. Are there areas in your life where you struggle to trust God? How can a deeper understanding of His character and past faithfulness help you overcome those struggles?
4. Take time to study the Bible and discover more about who God is and what He has done. How can this knowledge deepen your faith and relationship with Him?

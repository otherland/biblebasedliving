## Godhead

The term "Godhead" appears three times in the King James Version of the Bible: [Acts 17:29](https://www.bibleref.com/Acts/17/Acts-17-29.html), [Romans 1:20](https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/1/Romans-1-20.html), and [Colossians 2:9](https://www.bibleref.com/Colossians/2/Colossians-2-9.html). Although these verses use slightly different Greek words, they all convey the same meaning: "deity" or "divine nature." The term "Godhead" refers to God's essential nature.

### [Acts 17:29](https://www.bibleref.com/Acts/17/Acts-17-29.html) - The Only True God

In Acts 17, the apostle Paul is speaking to the philosophers of Athens on Mars Hill. As he argues against idolatry, Paul says, "Forasmuch then as we are the offspring of God, we ought not to think that the Godhead is like unto gold, or silver, or stone, graven by art and man's device" ([Acts 17:29](https://www.bibleref.com/Acts/17/Acts-17-29.html), KJV).

Paul uses the term "Godhead" to emphasize that there is only one true God. The Greek word used here is "theos," which is a general term used by the Greeks to denote any deity. By using this term, Paul is referring to the only true God in contrast to the false gods made by human hands.

**Why This Matters:** Understanding that there is only one true God helps us avoid idolatry and recognize the importance of worshiping Him alone.

**Think About It:** In what ways do people today create their own idols or false gods?

### [Romans 1:20](https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/1/Romans-1-20.html) - God's Divine Nature Revealed

In Romans 1, Paul begins to make the case that all humanity stands guilty before God. In verse 20, he says, "For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse" (KJV).

Here, the Greek word for "Godhead" is "theiotēs," which refers to divine nature. Paul's argument is that all of creation reveals God's existence and attributes. The natural world, with its intricate design and complexity, bears witness to God's eternal power and divine nature.

**Why This Matters:** Recognizing God's divine nature in creation helps us understand His greatness and appreciate the beauty and complexity of the world around us.

**Think About It:** How does observing nature reveal God's eternal power and divine nature to you?

### [Colossians 2:9](https://www.bibleref.com/Colossians/2/Colossians-2-9.html) - The Deity of Christ

[Colossians 2:9](https://www.bibleref.com/Colossians/2/Colossians-2-9.html) is one of the clearest statements in the Bible regarding the deity of Christ. It says, "For in him [Christ] dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily." The Greek word used here for "Godhead" is "theotēs."

According to this verse, Jesus Christ is the incarnation of the Godhead. He embodies the fullness of God's divine essence. This truth aligns with [Colossians 1:19](https://www.bibleref.com/Colossians/1/Colossians-1-19.html), which states that God was pleased to have all His fullness dwell in Christ.

**Why This Matters:** Understanding the deity of Christ helps us grasp the significance of His life, death, and resurrection. It also reveals His unique role in our salvation.

**Think About It:** How does knowing that Jesus embodies the fullness of the Godhead affect your understanding of His identity and purpose?

In summary, the term "Godhead" refers to the essence of the Divine Being. It emphasizes that there is only one true God and serves as a reminder to worship Him alone. The concept of Godhead also highlights how creation reveals God's eternal power and divine nature. Furthermore, [Colossians 2:9](https://www.bibleref.com/Colossians/2/Colossians-2-9.html) confirms the deity of Christ, emphasizing that Jesus embodies the fullness of the Godhead.

Remembering these truths can deepen our understanding of God's nature and His plan for our salvation.

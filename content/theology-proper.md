## Theology Proper: Understanding God and His Attributes

Theology proper is the study of God and His attributes. It focuses on understanding God the Father and delves into questions such as the existence of God, His attributes, and the nature of the Trinity. In this article, we will explore theology proper in a simplified manner while maintaining a biblical perspective.

### Does God Exist?

The very fact that some people aggressively try to disprove God's existence is actually an argument for His existence. The truth is, everyone ultimately knows that God exists. The evidence for God's existence is all around us, from the complexity of creation to the innate sense of morality within us. The study of theology proper affirms this truth and deepens our understanding of God's existence.

### Understanding God's Attributes

God possesses numerous attributes that define His nature. Some of these attributes include being immortal, invisible, all-wise, blessed, glorious, ancient, almighty, and victorious. These attributes are beautifully expressed in a hymn: "Immortal, invisible, God only wise...most blessed, most glorious, the Ancient of Days, Almighty, Victorious, thy great name we praise." Recognizing and understanding these attributes help us glorify and praise Him.

### The Mystery of the Trinity

The Trinity is one of the central doctrines in Christianity. While we can grasp some facts about the relationship between the different persons of the Trinity, it ultimately remains incomprehensible to our human minds. However, just because our finite minds struggle to fully comprehend it doesn't mean it is untrue or not based on biblical teachings. Theology proper acknowledges this mystery and encourages us to embrace and worship the triune God.

### Sovereignty vs. Free Will

The question of whether God is sovereign or if we have free will often arises when discussing matters of salvation. While our free will may come into play in certain areas of life (such as choosing what to eat for dinner), the focus in theology proper is primarily on our eternal destiny. The study of God's sovereignty and our free will in relation to salvation helps us understand that it is through God's grace that we are saved, and yet we are still responsible for making a choice to accept or reject His gift of salvation.

### Exploring God's Attributes

Theology proper delves into various attributes of God, including His omnipresence, omniscience, omnipotence, and eternality. These attributes help us understand who God is and what He does. For example, God's omnipresence means that He is present everywhere at all times. His omniscience means that He knows everything, past, present, and future. His omnipotence means that He is all-powerful and capable of doing anything. And His eternality means that He exists outside the constraints of time. Understanding these attributes helps us develop a deeper relationship with God.

### Correcting Misconceptions About God

Many people have misconceptions about God that affect how they relate to Him. Some view Him as a brutal tyrant with no love or grace, while others see Him solely as a loving friend with no justice or anger. Both of these perceptions are incorrect. Theology proper guides us in understanding that God is both full of mercy, love, and grace, as well as righteous, holy, and just. He grants mercy and executes judgment. He punishes sin and forgives sin. The study of theology proper helps us gain a more accurate understanding of who God truly is.

#### Why This Matters

The study of theology proper matters because it helps us develop a deeper understanding of God's nature and character. It enables us to worship and relate to Him in a more meaningful way. By gaining knowledge about His attributes, we can grow in our appreciation for who He is and how He works in our lives.

#### Think About It

Take a moment to reflect on your own understanding of God. How do you perceive His attributes? Are there any misconceptions you may have about Him? Consider how studying theology proper can help you develop a more accurate and comprehensive understanding of God.

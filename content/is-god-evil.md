## Is God Evil?

Many people have questioned whether God is evil, and there are various arguments presented to support this claim. One website, evilbible.com, attempts to demonstrate that the Bible is not the Word of God and that the God of Christianity is not worthy of worship. While their arguments may seem compelling at first glance, a closer examination reveals that they are based on misunderstandings of God's Word, character, and creation.

### Misunderstanding of God's Word

Evilbible.com asserts that the Bible is full of atrocities and contradictions, which they use to argue against its divine inspiration. While it is true that the Bible records many terrible things, such as the brutal rape and murder of a woman in Judges 19, it is important to understand that the Bible does not endorse or commend these actions. The Bible simply records historical events, including the sinful actions of humanity. Evilbible.com fails to recognize this distinction.

Another example they bring up is the command for Abraham to sacrifice his son Isaac. They argue that this proves God is not loving and good. However, they misunderstand the narrative. God never intended for Abraham to actually sacrifice his son; it was a test of faith. The story foreshadows God sacrificing His own Son Jesus for the sins of humanity. Evilbible.com's argument falls apart when one understands the true meaning behind this event.

Regarding supposed contradictions in the Bible, evilbible.com lists several examples to suggest that it is not inerrant. However, many of these alleged contradictions have been thoroughly discussed and addressed by biblical scholars. It is important to note that the Bible is a spiritual book with deeper meanings beyond literal interpretation. For example, [Leviticus 19:19](https://www.bibleref.com/Leviticus/19/Leviticus-19-19.html) prohibits mixing different kinds of animals, seeds, and materials. Critics may mock this as a prohibition against wearing wool and polyester blends, but it actually symbolizes Israel's need to remain devoted to God and not assimilate pagan teachings.

In summary, evilbible.com's claims of atrocities and contradictions in the Bible do not hold up under closer scrutiny. The Bible records historical events without endorsing them, and many supposed contradictions can be explained through a deeper understanding of spiritual lessons.

### Misunderstanding of God's Character

Evilbible.com portrays God as a tyrant and murderer, but this perspective is based on a misunderstanding of history and God's character. They argue that God's judgment on various cultures and peoples was unjust. However, they overlook the historical evidence that these nations practiced wickedness and atrocities. For example, the Assyrians were known for their brutal and cruel acts, such as impaling victims on sharp poles and making handbags from their skins.

Evilbible.com also claims that God is the creator of evil, citing [Isaiah 45:7](https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/45/Isaiah-45-7.html). However, this verse has been misunderstood due to a poor translation in the King James Version. The correct interpretation is that God brings calamity and disaster as consequences for those who oppose Him, not moral evil. God is a just and righteous deity who punishes those who persist in wickedness.

It is important to recognize that evilbible.com invokes a Christian moral framework to criticize God, which is intellectually inconsistent for atheists. Without a belief in God, there can be no objective basis for morality. Atheists like Richard Dawkins acknowledge this limitation and argue that life has no higher purpose or meaning. Therefore, evilbible.com lacks a moral foundation to make claims about good and evil.

In conclusion, evilbible.com's portrayal of God as a tyrant and creator of evil is based on misunderstandings of history, biblical interpretation, and the foundation of morality.

### Misunderstanding of God's Creation

Evilbible.com borrows from a Christian moral worldview to argue against God, which is irrational and disingenuous. They claim that creation itself refutes the existence of the God described in the Bible. However, they fail to provide an explanation for how an impersonal, amoral, purposeless universe could produce personal beings with a concern for morality and meaning.

The existence of evil is often used as an argument against God, but it can be understood within the framework of free will. Evilbible.com rejects this argument and fails to recognize that moral evil arises from the misuse of freedom. The crucifixion of Jesus, which appeared to be gratuitous evil, ultimately led to redemption for humanity. God's gift of freedom allows for moral choices and their consequences.

Evilbible.com also argues that God's nature contradicts the world we observe. However, the characteristics of the Judeo-Christian God align with what we can infer from creation itself. He is supernatural, powerful, eternal, omnipresent, timeless, immaterial, personal, necessary, infinite, diverse yet unified, intelligent, purposeful, moral, and caring. This profile matches the God described in the Bible.

In conclusion, evilbible.com's arguments against God's existence based on creation overlook the rationality and consistency of a divine Creator.

## Why This Matters

The question of whether God is evil is crucial because it shapes our understanding of who God is and how we relate to Him. Misunderstandings can lead to distorted views of God's character and hinder our ability to experience His love and grace. It is important to approach these questions with open hearts and minds while seeking a deeper understanding of God's Word.

## Think About It

- How does your perception of God's character influence your relationship with Him?
- Are there any areas in your understanding of God where you may have misconceptions or misunderstandings?
- How can a deeper understanding of God's Word help address questions or doubts you may have about His character?
- Reflect on the moral framework you hold. Where do you believe it originates from, and how does it affect your understanding of good and evil?

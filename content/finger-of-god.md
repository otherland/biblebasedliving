## The Finger of God: A Display of Divine Power

The phrase "the finger of God" appears four times in the Bible, three in the Old Testament and once in the New Testament. It is used to describe the supernatural power of God as it directly influences events in our world. Let's explore the significance of this phrase and its references in the Bible.

### Exodus: The Plagues and the Tablets

In the book of Exodus, we encounter two instances where the finger of God is mentioned. The first occurrence takes place during the plagues that were unleashed on Egypt to convince Pharaoh to release the Israelites from captivity. Moses, acting under God's instruction, turned dust into gnats through Aaron's staff. When Pharaoh's magicians failed to replicate this miracle, they acknowledged, "This is the finger of God" ([Exodus 8:19](https://www.bibleref.com/Exodus/8/Exodus-8-19.html)). This recognition emphasized that such powerful acts were beyond human capabilities.

The second reference to the finger of God in Exodus relates to the tablets of stone upon which the covenant law was inscribed. These tablets were described as being "inscribed by the finger of God" ([Exodus 31:18](https://www.bibleref.com/Exodus/31/Exodus-31-18.html)). While we understand that God is a spiritual being without physical fingers, this phrase is an anthropomorphism indicating that God directly caused the commandments to be engraved on the stone. In simpler terms, it signifies that God Himself was responsible for this miraculous writing.

### The Finger of God in the New Testament

In [Luke 11:20](https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/11/Luke-11-20.html), Jesus references the finger of God when addressing His critics after freeing a blind and mute man from a demon. He states, "If I drive out demons by the finger of God, then the kingdom of God has come upon you." This statement highlights that Jesus performed miracles through the overt power of God, just as He did during the plagues and with the tablets of stone.

In a similar passage in [Matthew 12:28](https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/12/Matthew-12-28.html), the phrase used is "the Spirit of God" instead of "the finger of God." The message remains the same â€“ Jesus' power to drive out demons is evidence that the kingdom of God is present. Both references emphasize that Jesus' miracles were a display of divine power at work.

### The Finger of God: A Symbol of Unlimited Power

The finger of God represents God's unlimited power as He directly intervenes in human affairs. This power is undeniable and incomparable to any human device or ability. Even the magicians in Pharaoh's court recognized the superiority of God's power when they witnessed the plagues brought about by the finger of God.

**Why This Matters:** Understanding the concept of the finger of God helps us recognize the supernatural nature of His power. It reminds us that there are limits to human abilities but no limits to what God can accomplish. As Christians, this knowledge should deepen our trust and reliance on Him.

**Think About It:** When faced with challenges or obstacles, how often do we rely on our own strength and abilities rather than acknowledging and seeking God's intervention? Reflecting on the finger of God can help us shift our focus from self-reliance to dependence on His limitless power.

In conclusion, the finger of God represents the supernatural power of God as it manifests in our world. The biblical references to this phrase in Exodus and the New Testament highlight instances where God's power was visibly at work through miracles performed by Moses and Jesus. Understanding this concept helps us grasp the magnitude of God's power and encourages us to trust in Him rather than relying solely on our own abilities.

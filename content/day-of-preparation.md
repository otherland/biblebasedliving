## Day of Preparation

In the Gospels, it is mentioned that Jesus was crucified on the Day of Preparation ([Matthew 27:62](https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/27/Matthew-27-62.html); [Mark 15:42](https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/15/Mark-15-42.html); [Luke 23:54](https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/23/Luke-23-54.html); [John 19:14](https://www.bibleref.com/John/19/John-19-14.html), 31, 42). This raises the question of why Jesus had already observed the Passover with His disciples before the Day of Preparation. To understand this, we need to examine the context and significance of the Day of Preparation.

### What is the Day of Preparation?

Every week, preparations had to be made for the Sabbath, which was observed from Friday evening to Saturday evening. These preparations included getting food ready ahead of time. As a result, "Day of Preparation" became a common term for "Friday." [Mark 15:42](https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/15/Mark-15-42.html) specifically states that Jesus was crucified on the Day of Preparation.

### Observing Passover and the Day of Preparation

Jesus and His disciples observed the Passover meal together before the Day of Preparation. The Passover meal was traditionally eaten on Nissan 14, according to the Mosaic Law ([Numbers 9:2-3](https://www.bibleref.com/Numbers/9/Numbers-9-2.html)). We can assume that Jesus kept the Law and observed Passover at the appointed time. 

After the Passover meal on Thursday, the following day was the Day of Preparation (Friday) when Jesus was crucified. This was followed by the Sabbath (Saturday) and then the first day of the week (Sunday), which is when Jesus rose from the dead.

### Understanding John's Statement

In John's account, he mentions that Jesus died on "the day of Preparation of the Passover" ([John 19:14](https://www.bibleref.com/John/19/John-19-14.html)). It is possible that John simply meant that this particular Friday fell during Passover week. In other words, it was the Day of Preparation that happened to coincide with the season of Passover.

### The Feast of Unleavened Bread

The Feast (or Festival) of Unleavened Bread lasted for a full week, from Nissan 15 to Nissan 22. The first day of Unleavened Bread coincided with the day of Passover. Because of the close relation between Passover and the Feast of Unleavened Bread, the whole week was sometimes referred to as "Passover." The two holidays were considered a single celebration.

In [John 18:28](https://www.bibleref.com/John/18/John-18-28.html), it is mentioned that the Jewish leaders did not enter Pilate's palace on the morning after Jesus' arrest to avoid ceremonial uncleanness so that they could eat the Passover. This seems to create a discrepancy since Jesus and His disciples had already eaten the Passover meal the night before. However, it is important to note that the Jewish leaders had already eaten the Passover proper but were still participating in the remainder of the week's ceremonies, including other sacrifices and meals associated with the Feast of Unleavened Bread.

### Why This Matters

Understanding the chronology and significance of the Day of Preparation and the observance of Passover helps us grasp the events leading up to Jesus' crucifixion and resurrection. It highlights Jesus' fulfillment of the Mosaic Law and His role as the ultimate sacrificial Lamb.

### Think About It

Reflecting on the timeline of events leading up to Jesus' crucifixion and resurrection can deepen our appreciation for God's plan of redemption. It reminds us that Jesus willingly sacrificed Himself to atone for our sins and reconcile us with God. Consider how this sacrifice impacts your own life and relationship with God.

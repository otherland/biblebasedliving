## Why Was Jesus Crucified?

### Introduction

The crucifixion of Jesus Christ is a central event in Christian theology and history. It has both earthly and heavenly reasons behind it, shedding light on the nature of mankind and God's plan for salvation. In this article, we will explore the reasons why Jesus was crucified, discussing the earthly motivations as well as the divine purpose behind this pivotal event.

### Earthly Reason: Mankind's Evil

At an earthly level, Jesus was crucified because of the evil present in mankind. Wicked individuals conspired against Him, falsely accused Him, and ultimately orchestrated His murder. The leaders of Israel had various reasons for wanting Jesus executed. They were envious of His following and fearful that His popularity would attract unwanted attention from the Roman authorities, potentially jeopardizing their own positions. Additionally, they resented Jesus for publicly exposing their sins and for claiming to be the Son of God.

However, these reasons were merely symptoms of their underlying unbelief. They failed to recognize Jesus as the long-awaited Messiah despite the evidence presented before them. Their hearts were hardened by pride and a refusal to accept Jesus' teachings and authority.

Jesus was crucified rather than being stoned, hanged, or subjected to other forms of execution because His death was carried out by the Romans. Crucifixion was a common method employed by the Roman Empire to serve as a deterrent against committing similar offenses. Pilate, the Roman governor, posted the charge "King of the Jews" on Jesus' cross to appease the Jewish leaders who sought His execution. Pilate could not afford to be seen as tolerating a potential rival to Caesar.

### Heavenly Reason: God's Plan for Salvation

Beyond the earthly motivations, there is a deeper heavenly reason why Jesus was crucified — God's plan for salvation. From a divine perspective, God had a redemptive plan to save humanity from sin, and Jesus was the chosen Lamb of God who came to take away the sins of the world.

Despite the evil acts committed against Jesus, the crucifixion was part of God's overarching plan to provide atonement for sin. The book of Acts acknowledges that Herod, Pontius Pilate, the Gentiles, and the people of Israel conspired against Jesus, but it also highlights that they were fulfilling what God had decided beforehand. Although evil desires were at work, God allowed them to accomplish the greatest good — the provision of salvation for mankind.

Jesus Himself acknowledged that Pilate's power over Him was given from above, indicating divine permission in the face of darkness. God used the hatred, conspiracy, false accusations, sham trials, and murder of His Son to achieve a glorious outcome. [Isaiah 53:10](https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/53/Isaiah-53-10.html) says, "It was the LORD's will to crush Him and cause Him to suffer," emphasizing that God had a purpose in Jesus' crucifixion. This purpose ultimately led to Jesus bearing the sins of many and making intercession for transgressors.

### Fulfillment of Prophecy

While there is no explicit mandate in Old Testament prophecy for the Messiah to be crucified, there are hints and foreshadowing of this manner of death. [Galatians 3:13](https://www.bibleref.com/Galatians/3/Galatians-3-13.html) connects Jesus' death on the cross with [Deuteronomy 21:22](https://www.bibleref.com/Deuteronomy/21/Deuteronomy-21-22.html)–23. Crucifixion allowed for the piercing mentioned in [Zechariah 12:10](https://www.bibleref.com/Zechariah/12/Zechariah-12-10.html), and it resulted in the shedding of blood necessary for a sacrificial offering as stated in [Hebrews 9:22](https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/9/Hebrews-9-22.html).

The crucifixion also fulfilled aspects of Psalm 22, which describes the anguish experienced by David but finds fulfillment in Jesus' suffering on the cross. Moreover, Jesus' bones were not broken during His crucifixion, aligning with [Exodus 12:46](https://www.bibleref.com/Exodus/12/Exodus-12-46.html) and [John 19:36](https://www.bibleref.com/John/19/John-19-36.html).

### Why This Matters

Understanding why Jesus was crucified is crucial for believers as it deepens their appreciation of God's plan for salvation. It highlights the extent of mankind's sinfulness and the lengths to which God went to redeem humanity. Recognizing the earthly and heavenly reasons behind Jesus' crucifixion allows us to grasp both the evil inherent in humanity and the goodness and sovereignty of God.

The crucifixion serves as a powerful reminder of the depth of God's love for us. It demonstrates His willingness to sacrifice His Son in order to reconcile sinful humanity to Himself. This knowledge should inspire gratitude, humility, and a desire to live in obedience to God's will.

### Think About It

1. Reflect on the earthly motivations that led to Jesus' crucifixion. Consider how envy, fear, pride, and unbelief can still hinder our recognition of Jesus today.

2. Contemplate the divine purpose behind Jesus' crucifixion. Ponder the depths of God's love and mercy in providing salvation for humanity through the sacrificial death of His Son.

3. How does understanding the reasons behind Jesus' crucifixion impact your relationship with God? How might it shape your perspective on sin, forgiveness, and the importance of faith in Jesus?

In conclusion, Jesus was crucified due to the evil present in mankind, driven by envy, fear, pride, and unbelief. However, from a heavenly perspective, God allowed Jesus' crucifixion as part of His plan for salvation. It fulfilled prophecies and demonstrated His love for humanity. Recognizing these reasons encourages believers to reflect on their own hearts and respond with gratitude and faith in Jesus' sacrificial death.

## God's Pleasure: Finding Joy in the Creator's Design

In our understanding of God, it is important to recognize that He is not a stern taskmaster opposed to all fun or pleasure. Contrary to this misconception, the Bible paints a different picture of Godâ€”a God who created us with the ability to experience delight and pleasure. Scripture speaks of our enjoyment and pleasure in various contexts, such as Psalm 16, [Proverbs 17:22](https://www.bibleref.com/Proverbs/17/Proverbs-17-22.html), and [Proverbs 15:13](https://www.bibleref.com/Proverbs/15/Proverbs-15-13.html). These verses reveal that God desires His creation to be enjoyed. 

God Himself takes pleasure in things, as seen in [Zephaniah 3:17](https://www.bibleref.com/Zephaniah/3/Zephaniah-3-17.html) where it states that He delights in us and sings over us. Additionally, God instituted celebrations and festivals in the Old Testament which were not only didactic but also intended for joyous celebration. Joy is a recurring theme in Scripture, evident in books like Philippians and Psalms. Jesus Himself declared that He came so that we may have life to the full ([John 10:10](https://www.bibleref.com/John/10/John-10-10.html)). This abundant life implies a pleasurable experience.

Furthermore, when we consider the design of the human body, we can see that pleasure is part of God's plan. Our taste buds and sensory organs testify to the fact that God is not opposed to pleasure. The enjoyment we derive from food, the pleasant scent of roses, or the satisfaction of a massage is evidence of God's intention for pleasure. He designed these experiences to bring delight into our lives.

It is important to distinguish between different types of pleasures in this world. We live in a fallen world where what society deems pleasurable does not always align with what is pleasing to God. [Galatians 5:19-21](https://www.bibleref.com/Galatians/5/Galatians-5-19.html), [Colossians 3:5-10](https://www.bibleref.com/Colossians/3/Colossians-3-5.html), and [1 Corinthians 6:12-17](https://www.bibleref.com/1-Corinthians/6/1-Corinthians-6-12.html) caution against indulging in worldly pleasures that are ultimately destructive. The story of the prodigal son in [Luke 15:11-17](https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/15/Luke-15-11.html) exemplifies how fleeting and empty worldly pleasures can be.

However, it is crucial to note that the purpose of our lives is not solely focused on pleasure. Hedonism, the pursuit of pleasure as the ultimate goal, is a false philosophy. Instead, we were created to find delight in God ([Psalm 37:4](https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/37/Psalm-37-4.html)) and to gratefully accept the good things He provides. Above all, our primary purpose is to have a relationship with God.

In summary, God is not opposed to pleasure per se. He is opposed to pleasure taking His place in our lives. Sometimes, we are called to forgo momentary pleasures in order to invest in the greater joy of God's kingdom. By seeking Him and His righteousness, we can experience the eternal pleasures that He has in store for us ([Psalm 16:11](https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/16/Psalm-16-11.html)).

### Why This Matters

Understanding God's perspective on pleasure helps us navigate the complexities of life. It enables us to discern between healthy and unhealthy pleasures, guiding us towards choices that align with God's will. Recognizing that God delights in us and desires our enjoyment helps counter the misconception that Christianity is solely about following rules or denying ourselves joy. Embracing the biblical concept of pleasure brings a sense of freedom and fulfillment as we engage with the world around us.

### Think About It

1. How does your understanding of God's view on pleasure affect your own pursuit of joy?
2. Are there any pleasures in your life that you feel might be taking precedence over your relationship with God?
3. In what ways can you actively seek and cultivate the eternal pleasures that God has in store for you?

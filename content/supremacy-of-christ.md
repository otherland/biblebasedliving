## The Supremacy of Christ

The supremacy of Christ is a fundamental Christian doctrine that affirms the authority and divinity of Jesus. In simple terms, to believe in the supremacy of Christ is to acknowledge that Jesus is God. The word "supreme" means "highest in rank or authority" or "highest in degree or quality." It signifies that there is no one greater. Jesus is the ultimate in power, glory, authority, and importance.

### Jesus' Supremacy in Hebrews

The book of Hebrews emphasizes the work of Jesus in relation to the Old Testament system. It explains that Jesus is not just a new way of doing things; He is supreme and surpasses the old ways. The author of Hebrews compares Jesus to the temple system under the Mosaic Law, stating that Jesus' ministry is superior to theirs. The new covenant established by Jesus is based on better promises ([Hebrews 8:6](https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/8/Hebrews-8-6.html)).

Furthermore, Hebrews highlights that Jesus is not only superior to roles and systems but also to creation itself. He is described as the radiance of God's glory and the exact representation of His being, sustaining all things by His powerful word (Hebrews 1:3a). This demonstrates that Jesus is not just a man but God Himself. His supremacy extends over all creation.

### The Supremacy of Christ in Colossians

[Colossians 1:15](https://www.bibleref.com/Colossians/1/Colossians-1-15.html)–23, often referred to as "The Supremacy of Christ," emphasizes that Jesus is above all things. He is called "the image of the invisible God" and "the firstborn over all creation" ([Colossians 1:15](https://www.bibleref.com/Colossians/1/Colossians-1-15.html)). The term "firstborn" does not imply that Christ was created but rather signifies a position of authority. Paul goes on to explain that all things were created through Jesus and for Him ([Colossians 1:16](https://www.bibleref.com/Colossians/1/Colossians-1-16.html)). This establishes Jesus as the Creator and affirms His divinity.

Paul further states that Jesus is before all things, holds all things together, and is the head of the Church. He is supreme over creation, death, and every aspect of life ([Colossians 1:17](https://www.bibleref.com/Colossians/1/Colossians-1-17.html)–18). Jesus' authority is all-encompassing, making Him unique and above all else.

### The Significance of Jesus' Supremacy

Understanding the supremacy of Christ is essential for our view of and worship of Him. It confirms that Jesus is fully God, not just a man or a moral teacher. His sacrifice on the cross for our sins is sufficient because He is infinite and able to atone for our infinite offense against God. The supremacy of Christ also refutes the idea that there are multiple paths to God. Jesus is not just one option among many; He is the only way to salvation.

Additionally, Jesus' supremacy reveals that we cannot rely on our own works or efforts to save ourselves. The Old Testament sacrificial system was unable to take away sins. Jesus fulfilled and replaced that system, making salvation a gift by grace through faith ([Ephesians 2:1](https://www.bibleref.com/Ephesians/2/Ephesians-2-1.html)–10). Our transformation into Christlikeness is only possible through the work of the Holy Spirit, not by our own strength.

The supremacy of Christ also establishes His authority over angels. He created them and is superior to them ([Hebrews 1:4](https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/1/Hebrews-1-4.html)). This refutes any inclination towards angel worship. Furthermore, recognizing Jesus' authority over both the physical and spiritual realms helps us maintain a proper perspective on creation. We are called to worship Jesus alone and not creation itself.

### Why This Matters

Understanding the supremacy of Christ has significant implications for our faith and relationship with God. It shapes our understanding of who Jesus is, the depth of His love for us, and His sufficiency for our salvation. By acknowledging His supremacy, we acknowledge His divinity and recognize Him as the ultimate authority in our lives.

### Think About It

- How does recognizing the supremacy of Christ impact your view of Jesus?
- In what ways does the supremacy of Christ challenge the idea of multiple paths to God?
- How does understanding Jesus' authority over creation and the spiritual realm affect your worship and perspective on the world?

In conclusion, the supremacy of Christ is a foundational Christian doctrine that affirms the authority and divinity of Jesus. It is supported by biblical passages in Hebrews and Colossians, which emphasize that Jesus is supreme over all creation, systems, and roles. Recognizing Jesus' supremacy has profound implications for our faith and relationship with God, shaping our understanding of salvation, worship, and our identity as believers.

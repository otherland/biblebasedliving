## What are the objections to Christian cultural protectionism?

Critics often argue that Christian cultural protectionism is rooted in racism and discrimination. They claim that preserving Christian traditions and resisting cultural fusion can lead to exclusion and marginalization of those who do not fit into the traditional Christian British identity. However, it is important to note that Christian cultural protectionism is primarily motivated by a desire to maintain the integrity and authenticity of Christian beliefs rather than promoting discrimination.

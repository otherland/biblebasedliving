## 9/11: Understanding God's Sovereignty and Purpose

On September 11, 2001, our world was forever changed by the tragic events that unfolded. Many people asked the question: Where was God in the midst of this terrible tragedy? As Christians, we believe that God is always present and in control, even in the face of evil and suffering. While it may be difficult to comprehend why a loving God would allow such a tragedy to happen, we must remember that God's ways are higher than our ways and His thoughts are higher than our thoughts ([Isaiah 55:9](https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/55/Isaiah-55-9.html)). 

### The Reality of Human Sinfulness

To understand why God allows evil and suffering in our world, we must first acknowledge the reality of human sinfulness. The Bible tells us that all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God ([Romans 3:23](https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/3/Romans-3-23.html)). Humanity is desperately wicked and sinful ([Romans 3:10-18](https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/3/Romans-3-10.html)). God allows human beings to commit sin for His own reasons and to fulfill His own purposes. This does not mean that God is responsible for the wicked acts of evil men.

### God's Eternal Perspective

God looks at things from an eternal perspective, while we often view things from an earthly perspective. We may wonder why God allowed Adam and Eve to sin and bring evil, death, and suffering upon all mankind. However, it is important to remember that the purpose of all creation and all creatures is to glorify God. God is glorified when His nature and attributes are displayed. If there were no sin, God would have no opportunity to display His justice and wrath as He punishes sin. Nor would He have the opportunity to show His grace, mercy, and love to undeserving creatures.

The ultimate display of God's grace was seen at the Cross, where Jesus died for our sins. Here, unselfishness and obedience were displayed in God's Son, who knew no sin but was made sin for us so that we might become the righteousness of God in Him ([2 Corinthians 5:21](https://www.bibleref.com/2-Corinthians/5/2-Corinthians-5-21.html)). This was all to the praise of His glory ([Ephesians 1:14](https://www.bibleref.com/Ephesians/1/Ephesians-1-14.html)).

### Recognizing the Miracles Amidst Tragedy

When reflecting on September 11, it is easy to focus solely on the tragedy and forget the miracles that occurred that day. Despite the devastation, there were countless instances where lives were saved and people were able to escape just in time. These miracles remind us that God was present even amidst the chaos.

For instance, a small group of firemen and one civilian survived in a tiny stairwell as one of the towers collapsed around them. The passengers on Flight 93 fought against the terrorists, preventing further destruction. These are just a few examples of the numerous miracles that took place that day.

### Why This Matters

Understanding God's sovereignty and purpose in the midst of tragedy is crucial for our faith. It reminds us that God is always in control, even when things seem out of control. Moreover, it helps us trust in His wisdom and goodness, even when we cannot fully comprehend His ways.

### Think About It

As we reflect on September 11, let us not only remember the tragedy but also the stories of hope and resilience. Let us be reminded of the countless lives that have been changed for the better since that day. It is possible that many people have turned to Christ and found salvation as a result of what happened. 

When faced with difficult circumstances or tragedies in our own lives, may we find comfort in knowing that God is with us. Let us trust in His sovereignty and have faith that He works all things together for good to those who love Him and are called according to His purpose ([Romans 8:28](https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/8/Romans-8-28.html)).

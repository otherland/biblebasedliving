## Ascension of Jesus Christ

The ascension of Jesus Christ is a significant event in Christian theology. After His resurrection, Jesus spent forty days teaching His disciples about the kingdom of God. Then, on Mount Olivet near Jerusalem, He ascended into heaven. This event is described in [Luke 24:50-51](https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/24/Luke-24-50.html) and [Acts 1:9-11](https://www.bibleref.com/Acts/1/Acts-1-9.html).

### Significance of the Ascension

The ascension of Jesus holds several important meanings within Christian belief:

1. **Conclusion of Earthly Ministry**: The ascension signaled the end of Jesus' earthly ministry. His mission on earth, which began with His birth in Bethlehem, was now complete. Jesus was returning to the Father after fulfilling His purpose.

2. **Success in Earthly Work**: The ascension indicated the success of Jesus' work on earth. He accomplished all that He came to do, including His sacrificial death and resurrection. Through His work, Jesus achieved the redemption and salvation of humanity.

3. **Return of Heavenly Glory**: During His time on earth, Jesus veiled His heavenly glory, except for a momentary unveiling at the Transfiguration ([Matthew 17:1-9](https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/17/Matthew-17-1.html)). The ascension marked the return of His full heavenly glory as He rejoined the Father.

4. **Exaltation by the Father**: Through the ascension, Jesus was exalted by the Father. He received honor and authority, being seated at the right hand of God ([Psalm 110:1](https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/110/Psalm-110-1.html); [Ephesians 1:20](https://www.bibleref.com/Ephesians/1/Ephesians-1-20.html); [Hebrews 8:1](https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/8/Hebrews-8-1.html)). This exaltation confirms His divine status and affirms His role as Lord and Savior.

5. **Preparation of a Place**: As Jesus ascended to heaven, He promised to prepare a place for believers ([John 14:2](https://www.bibleref.com/John/14/John-14-2.html)). This assurance gives hope to Christians that there is a future dwelling with Him in eternity.

6. **New Work as High Priest and Mediator**: Following the ascension, Jesus began a new work as the High Priest ([Hebrews 4:14-16](https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/4/Hebrews-4-14.html)) and Mediator of the New Covenant ([Hebrews 9:15](https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/9/Hebrews-9-15.html)). He intercedes on behalf of believers, offering forgiveness and reconciliation with God.

7. **Pattern for His Return**: The ascension of Jesus sets the pattern for His future return. Just as He physically ascended into heaven, He will return in the same manner, visibly and bodily ([Acts 1:11](https://www.bibleref.com/Acts/1/Acts-1-11.html); [Daniel 7:13-14](https://www.bibleref.com/Daniel/7/Daniel-7-13.html); [Matthew 24:30](https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/24/Matthew-24-30.html); [Revelation 1:7](https://www.bibleref.com/Revelation/1/Revelation-1-7.html)). Christians eagerly anticipate His second coming.

### Jesus' Present Role

Currently, Jesus Christ is in heaven seated at the right hand of the Father. This position signifies honor, authority, and His role as the Head of the Church ([Colossians 1:18](https://www.bibleref.com/Colossians/1/Colossians-1-18.html)). From this position, Jesus continues to be actively involved in the lives of believers.

Jesus is also the giver of spiritual gifts ([Ephesians 4:7-8](https://www.bibleref.com/Ephesians/4/Ephesians-4-7.html)). He equips individuals within the Church with unique abilities to serve and edify others. These gifts are essential for the functioning and growth of the body of Christ.

Furthermore, Jesus fills all things in all ways ([Ephesians 4:9-10](https://www.bibleref.com/Ephesians/4/Ephesians-4-9.html)). His presence is not limited by physical boundaries but extends throughout creation. As believers, we can experience His presence and guidance in our lives through the indwelling Holy Spirit.

### Why This Matters

Understanding the ascension of Jesus Christ is crucial for Christian faith and theology. It affirms His divine nature, His completed work on earth, and His ongoing role in the lives of believers. The ascension provides hope for believers, as it promises a future reunion with Christ and underscores His authority over all creation.

### Think About It

The ascension invites us to reflect on the significance of Jesus' earthly ministry and His ultimate triumph over sin and death. It assures us of His continued presence and intercession on our behalf. Consider how the ascension impacts your understanding of Jesus' work, His exaltation, and your own hope for the future.

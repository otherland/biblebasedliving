## God's Outstretched Arm

The phrase "God's outstretched arm" is mentioned several times in the Old Testament, specifically in reference to God's sovereign involvement in the world and His displays of power. This concept is often connected with phrases such as "mighty hand," "great judgments," "signs and wonders," and "war." By examining these references, we can gain a deeper understanding of God's outstretched arm and its significance.

### The Exodus and Deliverance

One of the earliest instances of God's outstretched arm is found in [Exodus 6:6](https://www.bibleref.com/Exodus/6/Exodus-6-6.html), where God promises Moses that He will deliver the Israelites from Egypt with an outstretched arm and great judgments. This theme of deliverance is further emphasized by Moses himself in Deuteronomy, as he reminds the people that God led them out of Egypt with signs, wonders, war, a mighty hand, and an outstretched arm ([Deuteronomy 4:34](https://www.bibleref.com/Deuteronomy/4/Deuteronomy-4-34.html)). 

### God's Mighty Hand and Outstretched Arm

Moses continues to reinforce the idea of God's mighty hand and outstretched arm throughout his writings. In [Deuteronomy 5:15](https://www.bibleref.com/Deuteronomy/5/Deuteronomy-5-15.html), he once again highlights how God brought Israel out of Egypt with His great power and outstretched arm. Moses challenges the people to recognize and remember God's greatness, His mighty hand, and His outstretched arm ([Deuteronomy 11:2](https://www.bibleref.com/Deuteronomy/11/Deuteronomy-11-2.html)). In his final reference to God's outstretched arm, Moses recounts how God brought Israel out of Egypt with a mighty hand, an outstretched arm, terrors, signs, and wonders ([Deuteronomy 26:8](https://www.bibleref.com/Deuteronomy/26/Deuteronomy-26-8.html)).

### Solomon's Dedication of the Temple

When Solomon dedicated the temple, he also spoke of God's great name, mighty hand, and outstretched arm ([1 Kings 8:42](https://www.bibleref.com/1-Kings/8/1-Kings-8-42.html); [2 Chronicles 6:32](https://www.bibleref.com/2-Chronicles/6/2-Chronicles-6-32.html)). This connection between God's outstretched arm and His power and authority is evident throughout these passages.

### Psalms and Jeremiah

The psalmists and the prophet Jeremiah also make references to God's outstretched arm. In [Psalm 136:12](https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/136/Psalm-136-12.html), a psalmist recounts how God brought Israel out of Egypt with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm, emphasizing God's everlasting lovingkindness. Jeremiah records multiple allusions to God's outstretched arm, including warnings of war against the nation due to their sin ([Jeremiah 21:5](https://www.bibleref.com/Jeremiah/21/Jeremiah-21-5.html)) and reminders of God's creation and His ability to accomplish great things ([Jeremiah 27:5](https://www.bibleref.com/Jeremiah/27/Jeremiah-27-5.html); [Jeremiah 32:17](https://www.bibleref.com/Jeremiah/32/Jeremiah-32-17.html)).

### Ezekiel's Prophecies

In Ezekiel, God promises to rule with a mighty hand, an outstretched arm, and with poured-out wrath ([Ezekiel 20:33](https://www.bibleref.com/Ezekiel/20/Ezekiel-20-33.html)â€“34). These prophecies speak of both judgment and restoration, as God promises to bring Israel back into the land with His mighty hand, outstretched arm, and poured-out wrath.

### Understanding God's Sovereignty

The references to God's outstretched arm in the Old Testament point to His sovereignty over the affairs of humanity, particularly in relation to Israel. They demonstrate His power, greatness, and ability to deliver His people. While these references can evoke a sense of fear and awe, they also reveal God's lovingkindness and His willingness to extend grace and restoration. It is important for us to recognize God's sovereignty, worship Him, and trust in His ability to fulfill His promises.

#### Why This Matters

Understanding the concept of God's outstretched arm helps us grasp the magnitude of His power and authority. It reminds us that we serve a God who is actively involved in our lives and has the ability to intervene in mighty ways. Recognizing God's sovereignty can bring comfort and assurance, knowing that He is in control and has the power to deliver us from any situation.

#### Think About It

Consider the instances in your life where you have experienced God's deliverance or intervention. How does reflecting on these moments deepen your understanding of God's outstretched arm? How can you trust in His sovereignty and rely on His power in your current circumstances? Take a moment to thank God for His lovingkindness and ability to work in your life.

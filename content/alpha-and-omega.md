## Alpha and Omega

The phrase "Alpha and Omega" is used in the book of Revelation to describe Jesus Christ. This phrase refers to the first and last letters of the Greek alphabet, symbolizing that Jesus is the beginning and end of all things. In Jewish tradition, using the first and last letters of the Hebrew alphabet represented the entirety of something from start to finish. Therefore, when Jesus calls Himself the Alpha and Omega, He is proclaiming His eternality and divinity.

### Jesus as the Beginning and End

One meaning of Jesus being the Alpha and Omega is that He existed at the beginning of all things and will exist at the end. This declaration signifies that He has always existed and will continue to exist. As the second Person of the Trinity, Jesus played a vital role in creation. The apostle John affirms this by stating, "Through him all things were made; without him nothing was made that has been made" ([John 1:3](https://www.bibleref.com/John/1/John-1-3.html)). Furthermore, Jesus' Second Coming will mark the beginning of the end of creation as we know it ([2 Peter 3:10](https://www.bibleref.com/2-Peter/3/2-Peter-3-10.html)). Being God incarnate, Jesus has no beginning or end in terms of time, existing from everlasting to everlasting.

### Jesus as the God of the Old Testament

Another meaning of Jesus as the Alpha and Omega is that it identifies Him as the God of the Old Testament. The prophet Isaiah attributes this aspect of Jesus' nature to the triune God in several verses. For example, Isaiah writes, "I, the Lord, am the first, and with the last I am He" (41:4). These passages emphasize the eternal nature of God. By proclaiming Himself as the Alpha and Omega, Jesus asserts His divinity and continuity with God as revealed in the Old Testament.

### Jesus as Author and Finisher

Jesus as the Alpha and Omega means that He is both the author and finisher of our faith. This phrase highlights that Jesus initiates and completes our journey of faith. The book of Hebrews describes Him as the "author and finisher" of our faith ([Hebrews 12:2](https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/12/Hebrews-12-2.html)). In other words, Jesus begins our faith walk and ensures its fulfillment. He is the sum and substance of the Scriptures, encompassing both the Law and the Gospel ([John 1:1](https://www.bibleref.com/John/1/John-1-1.html), 14). Jesus fulfills the requirements of the Law ([Matthew 5:17](https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/5/Matthew-5-17.html)) and is the focal point of the gospel of grace through faith ([Ephesians 2:8-9](https://www.bibleref.com/Ephesians/2/Ephesians-2-8.html)). From the first verse of Genesis to the last verse of Revelation, Jesus is present throughout the Bible, representing the entirety and completion of salvation.

## Why This Matters

Understanding Jesus as the Alpha and Omega is essential for several reasons. Firstly, it affirms His divinity and eternal nature. By declaring Himself as such, Jesus establishes Himself as the one true God. Secondly, recognizing Jesus as the Alpha and Omega emphasizes His role in creation. He is not only the Creator but also the sustainer of all things. Lastly, acknowledging Jesus as both the author and finisher of our faith encourages us to trust in Him fully. He is faithful to complete what He has started in us.

## Think About It

Consider the implications of Jesus being the Alpha and Omega in your life. How does knowing that Jesus has always existed and will always exist impact your trust in Him? Reflect on how Jesus' role in creation demonstrates His power and authority over all things. How does understanding Him as the author and finisher of your faith influence your perspective on your spiritual journey? Take time to meditate on these truths and allow them to deepen your relationship with Jesus.

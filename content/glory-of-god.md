## The Glory of God

The glory of God is a concept that refers to the beauty and majesty of His character. It is not a physical or material beauty but rather a reflection of all that He is. Unlike the glory of man, which fades away, the glory of God is eternal and unchanging. In the Old Testament, the glory of God was often accompanied by supernatural phenomena such as fire, clouds, and earthquakes. Moses once asked God to show him His glory, and in response, God revealed His goodness. However, because no mortal can fully comprehend or withstand the fullness of God's glory, Moses was hidden in a cleft in the rock.

In the New Testament, the glory of God is manifested in Jesus Christ. He is described as the "one and only Son" who came from the Father, full of grace and truth. Through Jesus, the glory of God became approachable and knowable. Jesus performed miracles that revealed His glory and promised to return someday with power and great glory. The redemption of Israel and the natural world also demonstrate God's glory. The psalmist declares that the heavens declare the glory of God, and all creation proclaims His work.

Heaven itself is referred to as "glory," and when believers die, they are received into glory in God's presence. In the future New Jerusalem, the city will be illuminated by the glory of God without the need for sun or moon.

It is important to note that God will not share His glory with anyone or anything else. Scripture condemns idolatry as people exchange the glory of God for images made to look like created beings. Only God is eternal, perfect, and worthy of worship.

### Why This Matters

Understanding the glory of God helps us grasp His nature and character. It reminds us that He is far greater than we can comprehend and deserves our worship and reverence. Recognizing God's glory also helps us put our own achievements and pride in perspective. The glory of man is temporary and fades away, but the glory of God is eternal and unchanging.

### Think About It

Take a moment to reflect on the beauty and majesty of God's character. How does recognizing His glory impact your worship and reverence for Him? Consider the transient nature of human glory compared to the eternal glory of God. How does this perspective shape your priorities and values?

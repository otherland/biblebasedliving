## Jesus' Last Hours

Jesus' last hours before His crucifixion were filled with significant events and profound emotions. These final moments reveal the immense sacrifice and love that Jesus demonstrated for humanity. Let's explore the key events leading up to His crucifixion and the significance they hold.

### Jesus' Final Meal and Betrayal

The night before His death, Jesus shared a Passover meal with His disciples. During this meal, Jesus washed the feet of His disciples, teaching them about humility and servanthood. It was during this time that He also revealed that one of His disciples, Judas Iscariot, would betray Him.

After the meal, Jesus instituted the Lord's Supper, a powerful act of remembrance that Christians continue to observe today. This symbolic act involves partaking of bread and wine, representing Jesus' body and blood given for the salvation of humanity.

### The Agony in the Garden

Following the meal, Jesus took His disciples to the Garden of Gethsemane. He asked Peter, James, and John to stay awake and pray while He withdrew to pray alone. Overwhelmed with sorrow and anguish, Jesus experienced such intense distress that His sweat fell like drops of blood.

In His prayer, Jesus asked God to take away the forthcoming torment if it aligned with the Father's will. However, what troubled Him most was not the physical pain but the weight of sin He would bear on behalf of humanity.

An angel appeared to strengthen Jesus during this agonizing time. Despite asking His closest disciples to pray for Him, they fell asleep repeatedly. This highlights the human struggle Jesus faced alone as He prepared to fulfill God's plan for salvation.

### Trials and Mockery

After being betrayed by Judas, Jesus endured a series of trials conducted by both Jewish and Roman authorities. These trials were characterized by mockings, beatings, and false accusations. The Jewish leaders, including Annas and Caiaphas, sought to find evidence against Jesus to justify His crucifixion.

Jesus also appeared before Pontius Pilate, the Roman governor of Judea, and Herod Antipas, the ruler of Galilee. Despite Pilate's recognition of Jesus' innocence, he gave in to the pressure from the crowd who demanded Jesus' crucifixion. Ultimately, Pilate handed Jesus over to be crucified.

### The Crucifixion

The crucifixion was a brutal form of execution reserved for criminals during Roman times. Jesus was nailed to a wooden cross and left to die a slow and agonizing death. In this excruciating position, He had to choose between resting His weight on the spikes driven into His hands or pushing up on the spikes in His feet to breathe.

As Jesus hung on the cross, people who had previously celebrated Him now taunted Him. Roman soldiers divided His possessions before His death. Amidst this anguish, Jesus witnessed His mother's grief as she looked upon the One promised to save the world.

When the soldiers came to break Jesus' legs, a common method to hasten death for those crucified, they discovered that He was already dead. Having fully surrendered His spirit, Jesus had completed His redemptive mission.

### Why This Matters

Understanding Jesus' last hours is essential for Christians because it reveals the depth of His sacrifice and love for humanity. By grasping the magnitude of Jesus' suffering and the weight of sin He bore, believers can appreciate the price paid for their salvation.

Jesus' willingness to endure such immense physical and emotional pain demonstrates His unwavering commitment to fulfilling God's plan for redemption. It serves as a reminder that God's love knows no bounds and that Jesus willingly laid down His life for humanity.

### Think About It

Reflecting on Jesus' last hours allows us to consider our response to His sacrifice. How does knowing the extent of Jesus' suffering impact our relationship with Him? How can we honor His sacrifice in our daily lives? Taking time to contemplate these questions can deepen our faith and inspire us to live more fully for Christ.

In conclusion, Jesus' last hours were marked by acts of love, betrayal, anguish, mockery, and ultimately, His crucifixion. It is through understanding and reflecting upon these events that Christians can appreciate the profound sacrifice Jesus made for the salvation of humanity. May we never forget the depth of His love and the significance of His final hours.

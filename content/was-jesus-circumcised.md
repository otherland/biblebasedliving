## Was Jesus Circumcised?

The question of whether Jesus was circumcised is an intriguing one, as it sheds light on an important aspect of Jesus' life and his fulfillment of the Old Testament law. Let's explore this topic in depth.

### 1. The Significance of Circumcision in the Old Testament

Circumcision was a significant practice in the Old Testament, commanded by God as a sign of the covenant He made with Abraham ([Genesis 17:9-14](https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/17/Genesis-17-9.html)). It involved the removal of the foreskin of the male reproductive organ and was meant to be performed on the eighth day after a baby boy's birth ([Leviticus 12:3](https://www.bibleref.com/Leviticus/12/Leviticus-12-3.html)).

### 2. Jesus' Birth and Jewish Identity

Jesus was born into a Jewish family, descended from the line of David ([Matthew 1:1-17](https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/1/Matthew-1-1.html)). Being born to Jewish parents, it is highly likely that Jesus would have been circumcised according to the requirements of the law.

### 3. The Gospel Accounts

Although there is no explicit mention of Jesus' circumcision in the Gospels, it can be inferred from Luke's account of Jesus' early life. In [Luke 2:21](https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/2/Luke-2-21.html), it is recorded that Jesus was named and circumcised on the eighth day, as prescribed by Jewish law. This event took place when Mary and Joseph presented Jesus at the temple in Jerusalem.

### Why This Matters: Fulfillment of the Law

Jesus' circumcision underscores his fulfillment of the Old Testament law. As an obedient Jew, Jesus willingly submitted himself to the requirements of the Mosaic law. His circumcision demonstrated his faithfulness to God's covenant with Abraham and his identification with his people.

### 4. Jesus' Mission and the New Covenant

While Jesus lived under the Old Testament law, his ultimate mission was to establish a new covenant between God and humanity through his death and resurrection. Circumcision, as a sign of the old covenant, would eventually be superseded by the new covenant in Christ.

### 5. Significance of Circumcision in the New Testament

In the New Testament, circumcision takes on a different meaning. The Apostle Paul teaches that physical circumcision is no longer necessary for those who have put their faith in Jesus ([Galatians 5:6](https://www.bibleref.com/Galatians/5/Galatians-5-6.html), [Romans 2:28-29](https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/2/Romans-2-28.html)). Instead, Paul emphasizes the circumcision of the heart, which signifies a transformation and inward commitment to God ([Romans 2:29](https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/2/Romans-2-29.html)).

### Think About It: Circumcision of the Heart

The concept of circumcision of the heart encourages believers to focus on their inner spiritual condition rather than external rituals. It reminds us that true obedience to God involves a genuine change of heart and a personal relationship with Him.

### 6. Jesus' Fulfilled Ministry

Jesus' life and ministry were characterized by fulfilling the prophecies and requirements of the Old Testament. His obedience to the law, including his circumcision, was a part of this fulfillment. By undergoing circumcision, Jesus demonstrated his commitment to God's covenant while also pointing toward the new covenant he would establish through his sacrifice.

### 7. A Symbol of Humility and Identification

Jesus' circumcision also serves as a symbol of humility and identification with humanity. By undergoing a procedure that was typically performed on infants, Jesus revealed his willingness to humble himself and identify with those he came to save.

### 8. The Perfect Example

In all aspects of his life, Jesus set an example for believers to follow. His circumcision serves as a reminder that we too should be obedient to God's commands and willingly submit ourselves to Him.

### Why This Matters: A Reminder of Jesus' Humanity

The fact that Jesus was circumcised highlights his true humanity. He experienced all that it meant to be human, including undergoing this physical procedure. This reinforces the biblical teaching that Jesus, while fully divine, also took on human nature.

In conclusion, while the Gospels do not explicitly mention Jesus' circumcision, it can be inferred from Luke's account that he was indeed circumcised on the eighth day according to Jewish law. Jesus' circumcision symbolized his faithfulness to the Old Testament covenant and his identification with his people. Ultimately, Jesus' circumcision points to his fulfillment of the law and establishes a foundation for the new covenant in Christ. It serves as a reminder for believers to humbly obey God's commands and follow Jesus' example in all aspects of life.

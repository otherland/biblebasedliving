Title: 10 Heartwarming Lessons from Jesus and Children
---

## Jesus and Children

### Introduction
Scripture records several instances of Jesus interacting with children, demonstrating His love and value for them. These interactions serve as important lessons on faith and humility. In this article, we will explore these accounts and the significance they hold for us today.

### Jesus Welcomes Children
One well-known account of Jesus interacting with children is found in Mark 10. People were bringing little children to Jesus for Him to bless them, but the disciples tried to prevent it. However, Jesus rebuked them, saying, "Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these" ([Mark 10:14](https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/10/Mark-10-14.html)). Jesus not only welcomes the children into His presence but also blesses each one individually. This highlights the importance Jesus places on children and their role in God's kingdom.

**Why This Matters:** Jesus' welcoming attitude towards children teaches us the importance of valuing and embracing children in our communities. Their innocence and trust serve as a reminder of the kind of faith we should have when approaching God.

**Think About It:** How can we ensure that our churches and communities are inclusive and welcoming to children? What steps can we take to prioritize their spiritual growth?

### Healing and Restoration
The Bible also records instances where parents brought their ailing children to Jesus for healing. For example, in John 4, a royal official approached Jesus seeking healing for his son who was close to death. Jesus responded by saying, "Go, your son will live" ([John 4:50](https://www.bibleref.com/John/4/John-4-50.html)), and the official's son was healed. Similarly, Jesus cast out demons from a young girl in Mark 7 and from a boy in Mark 9. These miracles demonstrate Jesus' compassion for children and His power to bring healing and restoration to their lives.

**Why This Matters:** The healing miracles performed by Jesus reveal His authority over sickness and the spiritual realm. They also show us that Jesus cares deeply about the well-being of children and desires to bring wholeness to their lives.

**Think About It:** How can we pray for the physical and spiritual healing of children in our communities? How can we support families who are facing health challenges with their children?

### Raising the Dead
In Luke 8, we read the account of Jairus, a synagogue leader, who came to Jesus seeking help for his dying daughter. While on their way to Jairus' house, messengers arrived with the news that the girl had died. However, Jesus told Jairus not to be afraid and proceeded to raise the girl back to life. This miraculous event demonstrates Jesus' power over death and His ability to bring hope and restoration even in the most desperate situations.

**Why This Matters:** The resurrection of Jairus' daughter reveals Jesus' authority over death itself. It reminds us that no situation is beyond His reach and that He can bring new life to seemingly hopeless circumstances.

**Think About It:** How does the resurrection of Jairus' daughter give us hope in difficult times? How can we trust in Jesus' ability to bring life and restoration to seemingly dead situations?

### Childlike Faith
Throughout His ministry, Jesus often used children as examples of the type of faith adults should have. In Mark 10, after blessing the children, Jesus told His disciples, "Truly I tell you, anyone who will not receive the kingdom of God like a little child will never enter it" ([Mark 10:15](https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/10/Mark-10-15.html)). In another instance, when the disciples were arguing about greatness in God's kingdom, Jesus brought a child forward and said, "Truly I tell you, unless you change and become like little children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven" ([Matthew 18:3](https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/18/Matthew-18-3.html)). According to Jesus, humility and simple acceptance, qualities often found in children, are essential for receiving the kingdom of God.

**Why This Matters:** Jesus calls us to possess a childlike faith, characterized by humility, trust, and a willingness to depend on God. This type of faith allows us to receive God's gift of salvation without pretention or hypocrisy.

**Think About It:** How can we cultivate childlike faith in our own lives? What aspects of our faith do we need to simplify and approach with greater humility?

### Our Heavenly Father's Provision
Children often rely on their parents for their daily needs, trusting that they will provide for them. In the same way, we are called to humbly depend on our Heavenly Father for provision in both the spiritual and physical realms. Just as children approach their parents with simplicity and trust, we should approach God with the same attitude.

**Why This Matters:** Recognizing our dependence on God and His provision helps us develop a deeper relationship with Him and strengthens our faith. It reminds us that God is our ultimate provider and sustainer.

**Think About It:** In what areas of your life do you struggle to depend on God's provision? How can you cultivate a deeper trust in God's ability to provide for your needs?

### Conclusion
The accounts of Jesus interacting with children demonstrate His love, compassion, and desire for each person to have a childlike faith. We are called to value and embrace children in our communities, pray for their healing and restoration, and learn from their simplicity and trust. May we strive to cultivate a childlike faith that leads us into a deeper relationship with our Heavenly Father.

## The Favor of God

The favor of God can be described as "demonstrated delight." It is the tangible evidence that a person has the approval of the Lord. When we favor someone, we want to be with them, delight in them, and connect with them in a special way. Similarly, God shows favor to those who delight in Him, connect with Him, and honor Him above all else.

To understand how to obtain God's favor, we must first recognize that favor is closely related to grace in the Bible. The only way to receive God's favor is by believing in the Lord Jesus and accepting Him as our Savior. Through faith in Jesus, we are saved by grace ([Ephesians 2:8-9](https://www.bibleref.com/Ephesians/2/Ephesians-2-8.html)) and experience the favor of God.

God seeks out those who love Him and obey His commands so that He can bless, guide, and protect them. This does not mean that everyone who is prosperous or healthy has found favor with God, nor does it mean that those who have God's favor will never face difficulties. Many people in the Bible who had God's favor also experienced hardships.

Those who are favored by God know that He is with them and that nothing can happen to them apart from His good purpose. They have confidence that their sins are forgiven, they are within God's plan, and that He is there for them at all times. They walk with God as their closest friend and appreciate the blessings He provides.

To seek God's favor, we need to humble our hearts before Him, seek Him for Himself rather than just His blessings, and arrange our lives around loving Him with all our heart, soul, mind, and strength. Seeking wisdom is also important in obtaining favor from the Lord.

**Why This Matters:** Understanding the favor of God helps us have a deeper relationship with Him. It reminds us to seek Him above all else and pursue a life that pleases Him. Knowing that we have God's favor gives us confidence and peace, even in the midst of difficulties.

**Think About It:** How does knowing that God's favor is not based on external circumstances but on our relationship with Him affect the way we view success and hardships? How can seeking wisdom help us obtain God's favor in our lives?

## The Characteristics of Those Favored by God

The Bible gives us insights into the characteristics of those who find favor with God. [Isaiah 66:2](https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/66/Isaiah-66-2.html) states that God looks with favor upon those who are humble, contrite in spirit, and who tremble at His Word. Second Chronicles 16:9 tells us that God shows Himself strong on behalf of those whose hearts are perfect toward Him. Having a heart perfect toward God means seeking His favor above all else.

It is important to note that finding favor with God does not guarantee a life free from difficulties or hardships. In fact, many individuals in the Bible who were favored by God also faced challenges. However, they remained faithful to God and trusted in His plan for their lives.

**Why This Matters:** Understanding the characteristics of those favored by God helps us evaluate our own hearts and actions. It encourages us to cultivate humility, contrition, and a reverence for God's Word in our lives.

**Think About It:** How can we cultivate humility and contrition in our relationship with God? How does having a heart perfect toward God affect the way we make decisions and prioritize our lives?

## The Assurance and Blessings of God's Favor

Those who have found favor with God can rest assured that He is with them and that His good purpose will prevail in their lives. [Romans 8:28](https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/8/Romans-8-28.html) assures us that all things work together for good for those who love God and are called according to His purpose. This assurance gives believers confidence and peace, knowing that even in difficult times, God is working for their ultimate good.

The favor of God also brings blessings. [Psalm 5:12](https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/5/Psalm-5-12.html) declares that the Lord blesses the righteous and surrounds them with His favor as with a shield. These blessings may not always be material or external, but they include the joy of knowing our sins are forgiven, being within God's plan, and experiencing His presence at all times. 

**Why This Matters:** Understanding the assurance and blessings that come with God's favor encourages us to trust in His plan for our lives and to find contentment in His presence, regardless of our circumstances.

**Think About It**: How does knowing that God's favor brings assurance and blessings change the way we view challenges and difficulties? How can we cultivate a heart of gratitude for the spiritual blessings that come with God's favor?

The Bible invites us to seek God's favor. [Psalm 119:58](https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/119/Psalm-119-58.html), 135 urges us to seek His favor wholeheartedly. Seeking God's favor requires humility, a genuine desire for Him, and aligning our lives with His will. It means seeking His kingdom and righteousness above all else ([Matthew 6:33](https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/6/Matthew-6-33.html)).

Seeking wisdom involves seeking understanding and guidance from God's Word, allowing His wisdom to shape our thoughts, decisions, and actions.

## The Reality of God's Favor

It is important to note that God's favor is not a guarantee of a problem-free life or a sign of superiority over others. It is not an excuse for pride or judgment. The reality is that many people who are favored by God also face challenges and difficulties. In fact, the Bible is filled with examples of individuals who experienced God's favor but also endured hardships.

The favor of God is not about worldly success or material blessings. It is about having a deep relationship with Him, knowing that He is with us, and experiencing His presence in our lives. It is about finding joy and contentment in His love and grace, regardless of our circumstances.

**Why This Matters:** Understanding the reality of God's favor helps us avoid misunderstandings and false expectations. It keeps us humble, dependent on God, and focused on the true blessings that come from knowing Him.

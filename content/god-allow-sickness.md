Title: Why Does God Allow Sickness? Understanding Divine Healing
---

## God's Purpose in Allowing Sickness

When we experience sickness or suffering, it can be challenging to understand why God allows it. However, as Christians, we believe that God's ways are higher than our ways ([Isaiah 55:9](https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/55/Isaiah-55-9.html)) and that He can bring about good from any situation ([Romans 8:28](https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/8/Romans-8-28.html)). While sickness is not always directly from God, He sometimes allows or even causes it to accomplish His sovereign purposes. It is important to remember that even in times of sickness, God is still in control.

### Sickness in a Fallen World

In a world tainted by sin, sickness, disease, and death will always be present. As fallen beings with physical bodies prone to disease and illness, we are susceptible to sickness as a result of the natural course of things in this world. Some sickness may also be the result of a demonic attack, as described in the Bible ([Matthew 17:14-18](https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/17/Matthew-17-14.html); [Luke 13:10-16](https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/13/Luke-13-10.html)). Even in these instances, God remains in control and can still use sickness according to His perfect will.

### Sickness as Discipline and Spiritual Growth

[Hebrews 12:5-11](https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/12/Hebrews-12-5.html) describes how God disciplines us to produce a harvest of righteousness. While sickness is not directly addressed in this passage, it teaches us that discipline can be a means through which God works for our spiritual growth. It may be difficult for us to comprehend why God would use sickness in this manner, but as believers in His sovereignty, we understand that suffering is something He allows and/or causes.

The psalmist in Psalm 119 provides us with an example of looking at suffering from God's perspective. As the psalmist reflects on his own afflictions, he acknowledges that it was good for him to be afflicted so that he might learn God's decrees and obey His Word. The psalmist recognizes that it was through his suffering that God's faithfulness was revealed.

### God's Sovereignty in Sickness

Understanding and accepting God's sovereignty in sickness can be a challenging concept. While we may not fully grasp why God allows sickness, we can trust that He is working all things for our ultimate good and His glory. Even the ultimate suffering—death—can be seen as an act of God's goodness, as it grants believers eternal life in heaven.

### Ministering to Those Suffering

When people are suffering, it is important for us as Christians to minister to them, care for them, pray for them, and offer comfort. In the midst of suffering, it may not always be appropriate to emphasize the idea that God will bring good out of the suffering. While this truth is valid, those who are suffering need our love and encouragement more than theological reminders.

## Why This Matters

Understanding why God allows sickness is crucial in our walk of faith. It helps us navigate the challenges and uncertainties that come with illness and suffering. Recognizing that sickness can serve a purpose in God's greater plan can bring comfort and hope during difficult times. It also reminds us of our need to trust in God's sovereignty and lean on Him for strength and guidance.

## Think About It

1. How does knowing that sickness is a result of living in a fallen world affect your perspective on illness?
2. Reflect on a time when you or someone you know experienced sickness or suffering. In what ways did it lead to spiritual growth or draw you closer to God?
3. How can you minister to those who are suffering without overwhelming them with theological explanations?

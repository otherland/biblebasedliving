## Jesus and Women

Jesus' treatment of women during His time on earth was revolutionary and counter-cultural. In a society where women were often marginalized and considered second-class citizens, Jesus shattered these prejudices and elevated the status of women to unprecedented heights. This article will explore the ways in which Jesus valued and empowered women, as well as the implications of His teachings for Christians today.

### The Value of Women in God's Plan

Jesus' elevation of women began even before He was born. God chose a woman, Mary, to be the mother of His Son, entrusting her with the most important message the world has ever received ([Luke 1:26](https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/1/Luke-1-26.html)–38). Furthermore, when Jesus was only eight days old, the Holy Spirit revealed His identity to a woman named Anna ([Luke 2:36](https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/2/Luke-2-36.html)–38). These instances demonstrate that God recognized and valued women from the very beginning.

### Jesus' Inclusive Ministry

Throughout His earthly ministry, women flocked to hear Jesus teach and some even supported Him financially ([Matthew 27:55](https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/27/Matthew-27-55.html); [Mark 15:41](https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/15/Mark-15-41.html); [Luke 8:2](https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/8/Luke-8-2.html)–3). Jesus treated women with the same love, respect, and dignity that He showed to men. He included several women among His closest friends and disciples ([Luke 10:38](https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/10/Luke-10-38.html)–39; 24:10; [John 11:5](https://www.bibleref.com/John/11/John-11-5.html)). This inclusivity was radical for the time. The fact that women are named in the Bible is significant because it challenges the cultural norm that women were not worth mentioning. Jesus' actions shattered these social norms and emphasized the important roles that women played in furthering God's kingdom.

### Breaking Cultural Barriers

Jesus did not shy away from engaging with people who were considered outcasts or marginalized by society. One powerful example is His encounter with an immoral Samaritan woman at a well ([John 4:4](https://www.bibleref.com/John/4/John-4-4.html)–26). In a culture where Jews avoided any interaction with Samaritans, Jesus broke down barriers and spoke to her, transforming her life and impacting an entire city.

Another instance that showcases Jesus' treatment of women is His response to the woman caught in adultery ([John 8:2](https://www.bibleref.com/John/8/John-8-2.html)–11). The Jewish leaders brought her to Jesus, hoping to trap Him with a dilemma. However, Jesus turned the tables on them and challenged their self-righteousness. He demonstrated that everyone is a sinner and that no one has the right to pass judgment on others.

### Women at the Crucifixion and Resurrection

During Jesus' crucifixion, women were the last to leave His side and the first to visit His empty tomb ([Matthew 27:61](https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/27/Matthew-27-61.html); 28:1). This displays their courage and boldness, which were a result of the transforming power of Jesus in their lives. In a beautiful display of faith, these women became the world's first witnesses of the resurrection ([Matthew 28:8](https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/28/Matthew-28-8.html)).

### Implications for Christians Today

Jesus' treatment of women serves as an example for Christians today. When Jesus calls a man or a woman to follow Him, He transforms them into new creatures ([2 Corinthians 5:17](https://www.bibleref.com/2-Corinthians/5/2-Corinthians-5-17.html)). Old prejudices and stereotypes no longer define us. As Christians, we are united by one Spirit ([Ephesians 4:5](https://www.bibleref.com/Ephesians/4/Ephesians-4-5.html)), viewing each other as brothers and sisters in the family of God.

This means that men and women should work together in harmony, recognizing the unique contributions each gender brings to the family and the church. There is neither male nor female in Christ; we are all equal in His eyes ([Galatians 3:28](https://www.bibleref.com/Galatians/3/Galatians-3-28.html)). This should encourage us to value and empower women within our communities, ensuring they have equal opportunities to serve and lead.

### Why This Matters

Understanding Jesus' treatment of women is crucial because it challenges cultural norms and prejudices that still exist today. It reminds us of the inherent value and worth of every individual, regardless of gender. By embracing Jesus' example, we can create a more inclusive and egalitarian society where both men and women can thrive.

### Think About It

Consider the ways in which you can actively value and empower women within your church and community. Are there any biases or stereotypes that you need to confront and overcome? How can you follow Jesus' example of treating women with dignity, compassion, and respect? Prayerfully reflect on these questions and ask God to guide you in promoting equality and inclusivity.

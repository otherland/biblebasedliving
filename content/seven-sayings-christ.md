## Seven Sayings of Christ on the Cross

The crucifixion of Jesus Christ is a pivotal event in Christian theology. During His time on the cross, Jesus made seven significant statements that carry profound meaning for believers. Let's explore these sayings and their significance.

### 1. "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?" ([Matthew 27:46](https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/27/Matthew-27-46.html))

In this statement, Jesus expresses His feelings of abandonment as He takes upon Himself the sins of the world. Jesus, who is holy, was made to be sin for us so that we might be reconciled to God. This cry from the cross echoes the words of [Psalm 22:1](https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/22/Psalm-22-1.html) and shows the depth of Jesus' sacrifice for humanity.

**Why This Matters:** Jesus' cry reveals the extent to which He suffered on our behalf. It reminds us of the gravity of sin and the incredible love and sacrifice of Jesus in taking our place.

**Think About It:** Reflect on the weight of your own sins and how Jesus willingly bore them for you. How does this make you feel? How does it impact your understanding of God's love?

### 2. "Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing" ([Luke 23:34](https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/23/Luke-23-34.html))

Despite the mocking and cruelty He endured, Jesus extends forgiveness to those who crucified Him. Even in His moment of agony, Jesus demonstrates limitless compassion and divine grace. The ignorance of those who crucified Him does not excuse their actions, but Jesus' prayer reveals His heart of forgiveness.

**Why This Matters:** This statement challenges us to extend forgiveness to others, even when they may not deserve it. It reminds us that forgiveness is a central aspect of Christian love and reflects God's character.

**Think About It:** Are there people in your life whom you find it difficult to forgive? How can you follow Jesus' example and extend forgiveness to them?

### 3. "Truly, I say to you, today you will be with me in paradise" ([Luke 23:43](https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/23/Luke-23-43.html))

One of the criminals crucified alongside Jesus recognized Him as the Messiah and asked for His mercy. In response, Jesus assured the criminal that they would be together in paradise that very day. This statement illustrates the power of faith and shows that even at the hour of death, it is never too late to turn to Jesus.

**Why This Matters:** This statement highlights the importance of faith in receiving eternal life. It emphasizes that salvation is available to all who turn to Jesus, regardless of their past.

**Think About It:** How does this statement challenge your understanding of salvation? How does it give you hope for your own salvation and the salvation of others?

### 4. "Father, into your hands I commit my spirit" ([Luke 23:46](https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/23/Luke-23-46.html))

As Jesus nears death, He willingly surrenders His soul into His Father's hands. This statement reveals His trust in God and signifies that His sacrifice has been accepted. Jesus' offering of Himself unblemished to God is a fulfillment of [Hebrews 9:14](https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/9/Hebrews-9-14.html).

**Why This Matters:** Jesus' words demonstrate His complete surrender to God and His trust in His Father's plan. It teaches us to trust God even in our darkest moments.

**Think About It:** How can you cultivate a deeper trust in God? In what areas of your life do you struggle to surrender control to Him?

### 5. "Dear Woman, here is your son!" and "Here is your mother!" ([John 19:26-27](https://www.bibleref.com/John/19/John-19-26.html))

From the cross, Jesus sees His mother Mary standing nearby, along with the Apostle John. He entrusts the care of His mother to John, ensuring she will be looked after. Even in His suffering, Jesus displays compassion and concern for those He loves.

**Why This Matters:** Jesus' care for His mother exemplifies His compassion and teaches us to prioritize the needs of our loved ones, even in difficult circumstances.

**Think About It:** How can you demonstrate love and care for those close to you, particularly in times of hardship? What can you learn from Jesus' example?

### 6. "I am thirsty" ([John 19:28](https://www.bibleref.com/John/19/John-19-28.html))

By declaring His thirst, Jesus fulfills the Messianic prophecy found in [Psalm 69:21](https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/69/Psalm-69-21.html). This statement prompts the Roman guards to give Him vinegar, as was customary during crucifixions. It serves as a fulfillment of Scripture and underscores Jesus' role as the Messiah.

**Why This Matters:** Jesus' fulfillment of prophecy confirms His identity as the long-awaited Messiah. It reminds us that every detail of His life and death was part of God's divine plan.

**Think About It:** How does Jesus' fulfillment of prophecy strengthen your faith? How does it deepen your trust in God's sovereignty?

### 7. "It is finished!" ([John 19:30](https://www.bibleref.com/John/19/John-19-30.html))

These words signify the completion of Jesus' mission on earth. He declares that His suffering is over and that He has accomplished the work His Father gave Him to do. Through His life, death, and resurrection, Jesus has paid the debt of sin and obtained eternal salvation for all who believe in Him.

**Why This Matters:** Jesus' declaration of "It is finished!" assures us that salvation is complete and available through faith in Him. It reminds us that our salvation is not based on our works but on His finished work on the cross.

**Think About It:** How does this statement impact your understanding of salvation? How does it encourage you to live out your faith?

In conclusion, the seven sayings of Christ on the cross hold deep significance for Christians. They reveal Jesus' love, forgiveness, trust, compassion, and fulfillment of prophecy. As we reflect on these statements, may our hearts be filled with gratitude for the immense sacrifice of Jesus and the hope we have in Him.

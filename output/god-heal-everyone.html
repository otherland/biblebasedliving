to understand that physical healing is not always God's will. While we may pray and have faith for healing, if it is not in God's plan at that moment, we may not receive physical healing (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/1-John/5/1-John-5-14.html>1 John 5:14</a>). It is crucial to recognize that God's blessings can come in various forms, not just through physical healing. If it were God's will for everyone to be healed, then no one would ever become ill or experience suffering. We cannot attribute someone's illness to a lack of faith, as the Bible shows that even faithful individuals like Paul and Trophimus experienced illness (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/2-Timothy/4/2-Timothy-4-20.html>2 Timothy 4:20</a>, <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/2-Corinthians/12/2-Corinthians-12-7.html>2 Corinthians 12:7</a>â€“9).<p>Sometimes, Christians have an oversimplified view of healing. They believe that if they are sick, they only need to ask God for healing, and because God loves them, He will heal them instantly. This perspective often sees healing as proof of a person's faith and God's love. However, this understanding overlooks the truth that parents do not give their children everything they ask for, even if they love them deeply.<p>Joni Eareckson Tada has grappled with this issue for many years. She prayed fervently for physical healing from her quadriplegia and had full belief that God would heal her. But she remains in a wheelchair today, forty-five years after her accident. Joni's perspective now reflects great faith as she understands that if God does not remove suffering, He will use it for His purpose and transform individuals through their struggles (Grace to You, October 16, 2013). It is important to recognize that our understanding of healing can be limited and that God works in ways beyond our comprehension.<h3>Why This Matters</h3><p>Understanding that physical healing is not always part of God's plan can help alleviate feelings of guilt or doubt when prayers for healing go unanswered. It allows us to trust in God's sovereignty and recognize that He works in ways that may not align with our desires or expectations. Embracing this perspective can lead to a deeper understanding of the purpose behind suffering and the opportunity for spiritual growth.<h3>Think About It</h3><p>Have you ever felt disappointed or discouraged when prayers for healing were not answered? How does knowing that physical healing is not always God's will change your perspective on unanswered prayers? Consider how you can find hope and spiritual growth even in the midst of suffering.<h2>Healing: A Rare Occurrence</h2><p>It is essential to recognize that healings, even in the Bible, are rare occurrences. For the first 2,500 years of biblical history, there is no mention of any healings. It is only during the life of Abraham that we potentially see a healing implied (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/12/Genesis-12-17.html>Genesis 12:17</a>â€“20). The next healing mentioned is when Moses cleanses Miriam from leprosy (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Numbers/12/Numbers-12-13.html>Numbers 12:13</a>â€“15). These examples highlight that healings were not a common occurrence throughout biblical history.<p>In the Old Testament, under the Mosaic Covenant with Israel, there was an emphasis on physicality and material blessings. God promised Israel freedom from disease if they remained faithful to Him (Deuteronomy 28). This context helps us understand the meaning of miracles in the Bible. Healings were signs from God, primarily for the Jews under the Old Covenant, validating the authority of leaders like Moses and confirming the truth of their message.<p>With the coming of Christ, we witness the fulfillment of the Mosaic Covenant (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/5/Matthew-5-17.html>Matthew 5:17</a>) and a reversal of Israel's spiritual decline. Jesus healed the sick wherever He went, not simply out of kindness but as a sign from heaven, demonstrating His authority as the Messiah (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/John/7/John-7-31.html>John 7:31</a>). These healings allowed Israel to experience a taste of the kingdom of God (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/11/Luke-11-20.html>Luke 11:20</a>). However, those who rejected Jesus' authority often remained sick (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/13/Matthew-13-58.html>Matthew 13:58</a>). It is important to note that Jesus did not heal everyone but healed specific individuals within a multitude.<p>The apostles were also given the power to heal the sick, and for thirty-seven years, they went everywhere, performing these miracles as confirmation of the truth of the gospel they proclaimed. However, even the apostles did not heal everyone they encountered. The apostle Paul, for instance, instructed Timothy to use wine for his frequent illnesses (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/1-Timothy/5/1-Timothy-5-23.html>1 Timothy 5:23</a>). This shows that healing was not solely based on an individual's faith but was dependent on God's will.</p><iframe allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen frameborder=0 height=315 src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/AdQ7Oc5JPUc width=560></iframe><h3>Why This Matters</h3><p>Recognizing that healings were rare occurrences throughout biblical history helps us understand that physical healing is not a guarantee today. It challenges our expectations and encourages us to trust in God's sovereignty. Additionally, it highlights the purpose of miracles as signs from God, validating His message and authority.<h3>Think About It</h3><p>Consider your understanding of miracles and healings in the Bible. How does knowing that healings were rare occurrences throughout history change your perspective on miraculous healing today? How might this understanding impact your faith and expectations?<h2>The Complexity of God's Will</h2><p>In our present time, we are not living in the apostolic era when miracles and healings were more prevalent. While God can and does still heal today when He desires to do so, it is crucial to discern what God wants for each individual situation. Sometimes, God may choose to heal someone physically in this life, while other times He may have a different plan to reveal His glory through weakness. Ultimately, all sickness and death will be eradicated when Jesus returns (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Revelation/21/Revelation-21-4.html>Revelation 21:4</a>).<p>It is essential to remember that physical healing is just one aspect of God's healing. The greater healing that God offers is the cleansing of sinful hearts, which He performs every day. This spiritual healing is available to all who place their faith in Jesus Christ. While physical healing may not always be part of God's plan, the promise of eternal life and spiritual restoration is guaranteed for those who believe in Him.<h3>Why This Matters</h3><p>Understanding that physical healing is not always God's will enables us to focus on the greater healing that God offers through salvation. It reminds us of the ultimate hope we have in Christ and the promise of eternal life. This perspective can bring comfort and assurance even in the midst of physical suffering.<h3>Think About It</h3><p>Reflect on your understanding of God's will regarding healing. How does knowing that physical healing is not always part of God's plan impact your perspective on suffering and the hope we have in Christ? Consider how you can find peace and comfort in the promise of eternal life and spiritual healing.<p>In conclusion, when it comes to the topic of God healing everyone, it is important to recognize that physical healing is not always part of His will. While we may pray for healing and have faith, it is crucial to trust in God's sovereignty and understand that His blessings come in various forms. Healing is not solely based on an individual's faith, as even faithful individuals like Paul experienced illness. We must also remember that healings were rare occurrences throughout biblical history, serving as signs from God to validate His message and authority.<p>In our present time, as we await Jesus' return, physical healing may or may not be part of God's plan for each situation. However, the greater healing that God offers is the cleansing of sinful hearts through faith in Jesus Christ. This spiritual restoration is available to all who believe, providing hope and assurance even in the midst of physical suffering. Let us trust in God's will, knowing that He works beyond our understanding and has a purpose for every circumstance.</section><div class=author-info><img alt="Maisha Johnson" class=author-image loading=lazy src=https://biblebasedliving.com/images/profile.png><div class=author-details><h4>Maisha Johnson</h4><p>Written by Maisha Johnson, a dedicated Christian writer known for her inspiring narratives and deep spiritual insights.

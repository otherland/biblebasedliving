accomplish several important purposes for our benefit and His glory. Let's explore six key reasons why God sent Jesus:<h3>1. Revealing the Father</h3><p>God sent Jesus to reveal Himself to us in a way that we can understand and relate to. While we can learn about God through creation, Jesus showed us what God is truly like. In <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/John/1/John-1-18.html>John 1:18</a>, it says, "No one has ever seen God, but the one and only Son, who is himself God and is in closest relationship with the Father, has made him known." Jesus is the exact representation of God's essence, and if we have seen Jesus, we have seen the Father. Through Jesus' words, thoughts, emotions, and actions, we can know and understand God personally.<p><strong>Why this matters:</strong> Without Jesus, we would be left wondering about God's true nature and how to have a relationship with Him. But through Jesus' revelation of the Father, we can know God intimately and experience His love and care for us.<p><strong>Think about it:</strong> How does knowing that Jesus reveals God's character impact your understanding of who God is? How does it affect your relationship with Him?<h3>2. Demonstrating God's Love</h3><p>Another reason why God sent Jesus is to demonstrate His love for us. <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/5/Romans-5-8.html>Romans 5:8</a> tells us that "God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us." Jesus' works and His sacrificial death on the cross reveal God's immense love for humanity. Through Jesus' life and teachings, we see that God desires to meet our needs and cares deeply for us.<p><strong>Why this matters:</strong> Without Jesus, we might doubt God's love or question His goodness and care. But through Jesus' actions and sacrifice, we can have confidence in God's love for us.<p><strong>Think about it:</strong> How does Jesus' demonstration of God's love impact your understanding of your worth and value to God? How does it influence the way you love and serve others?<h3>3. Offering Access to the Father</h3><p>God sent Jesus to provide a way for us to have a close, familial relationship with Him. In <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/6/Matthew-6-9.html>Matthew 6:9</a>, Jesus teaches us to pray, saying, "Our Father in heaven." Through Jesus, we can approach God as His beloved children. We are not just created beings or subjects of God's law and judgment; we are invited into a family relationship with Him.<p><strong>Why this matters:</strong> Without Jesus, we would be forever separated from God, feeling distant and disconnected. But through Jesus, we can experience the intimacy of being God's children and enjoy a loving relationship with Him.<p><strong>Think about it:</strong> How does understanding God as our Father impact your prayer life and your sense of belonging? How does it shape your identity as a child of God?<h3>4. Providing Forgiveness and Salvation</h3><p>One of the most significant reasons why God sent Jesus is to provide forgiveness for our sins and offer salvation. <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/9/Hebrews-9-26.html>Hebrews 9:26</a> says that Jesus "has appeared once for all at the culmination of the ages to do away with sin by the sacrifice of himself." The sacrifices under the old Levitical system were insufficient to take away sin permanently. But Jesus offered Himself as the perfect sacrifice for our sins, establishing a new covenant between God and His people.<p><strong>Why this matters:</strong> Our religious actions, good deeds, or even our death cannot remove the stain of sin from our souls. Only Jesus' sacrifice on the cross can wash away our sins. Through faith in Him, we can experience full deliverance from guilt, freedom from sin's hold, true salvation, and peace with God.<p><strong>Think about it:</strong> How does the reality of forgiveness and salvation through Jesus impact your relationship with God and your approach to sin? How does it shape your understanding of grace?<h3>5. Defeating the Works of the Devil</h3><iframe allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen frameborder=0 height=315 src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/ITEzXLcpKZs width=560></iframe><p>God sent Jesus into the world to destroy the works of the devil. In <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/1-John/3/1-John-3-8.html>1 John 3:8</a>, it says, "The reason the Son of God appeared was to destroy the devil's work." Jesus accomplished this mission by His holiness, sacrifice, and grace. He demolished the deception, sin, and death that Satan had brought into the world. Through Jesus' victory, Satan's plans are thwarted, and his future involves ultimate defeat.<p><strong>Why this matters:</strong> The works of the devil include deception, sin, and death, which have plagued humanity since the fall. But through Jesus' triumph over these works, we can experience freedom from deception, forgiveness for our sins, and eternal life beyond death.<p><strong>Think about it:</strong> How does knowing that Jesus has defeated the works of the devil give you hope and assurance? How does it affect your resistance to temptation and your trust in God's ultimate victory?<h3>6. Setting an Example for Righteous Living</h3><p>Lastly, God sent Jesus to set an example for us to follow. In <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/1-Peter/2/1-Peter-2-21.html>1 Peter 2:21</a>, it says that Christ left us an example to follow in His steps. Jesus demonstrated how to handle temptation without sinning, lived a blameless life in both word and deed, nurtured a prayer life, and relied on the power of the Holy Spirit.<p><strong>Why this matters:</strong> As followers of Christ, we are called to conduct ourselves as He did. We are to strive for holiness and righteousness in our lives, imitating Jesus' character and relying on His strength.<p><strong>Think about it:</strong> How does Jesus' example impact your daily choices and actions? How does it shape your understanding of discipleship and following Christ?<h2>Conclusion</h2><p>God sent Jesus into the world for several important reasons: to reveal Himself to us, demonstrate His love, offer us access to the Father, provide forgiveness and salvation, defeat the works of the devil, and set an example for righteous living. Understanding these reasons helps us grasp the depth of God's love and purpose for our lives. Through Jesus, we can know God intimately, experience His forgiveness and grace, and live in the freedom and victory He has won for us.<p>As we reflect on the reasons why God sent Jesus, let us respond with gratitude, love, and a desire to follow in His footsteps. May our lives bring glory to God as we seek to fulfill the work He has given us to do.</section><div class=author-info><img alt="Maisha Johnson" class=author-image loading=lazy src=https://biblebasedliving.com/images/profile.png><div class=author-details><h4>Maisha Johnson</h4><p>Written by Maisha Johnson, a dedicated Christian writer known for her inspiring narratives and deep spiritual insights.

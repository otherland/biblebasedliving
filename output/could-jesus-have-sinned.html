While both sides agree that Jesus did not sin, the disagreement arises regarding whether He could have sinned. This article will explore two perspectives: "impeccability" (believing Jesus could not have sinned) and "peccability" (believing Jesus could have sinned but did not). By examining biblical teachings, we can gain a better understanding of this theological question.<h3>Impeccability: Jesus Could Not Have Sinned</h3><p>According to the doctrine of impeccability, Jesus could not have sinned. Supporters of this view argue that if Jesus could have sinned, He would still be capable of sinning today because He retains the same divine essence He had while living on earth. As the God-Man, Jesus remains fully divine and fully human, inseparably united in one person. To believe that Jesus could sin would imply that God Himself could sin, which goes against His nature (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Colossians/1/Colossians-1-19.html>Colossians 1:19</a>, 2:9).<p>Jesus, although fully human, was not born with the sinful nature that we inherit. He faced temptations from Satan but remained sinless because sin is contrary to God's nature (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/4/Matthew-4-1.html>Matthew 4:1</a>; <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/2/Hebrews-2-18.html>Hebrews 2:18</a>, 4:15; <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/James/1/James-1-13.html>James 1:13</a>). Temptation itself is not sinful; it becomes sinful when someone dwells upon a sinful act and considers participating in it. Jesus experienced temptation in a way that aligns with the first definition - suggestions of sinful acts were presented to Him, but He had no inner desire to participate in them.<h3>Peccability: Jesus Could Have Sinned But Did Not</h3><p>Those who hold to peccability believe that Jesus could have sinned but chose not to. They argue that if Jesus could not have sinned, He could not genuinely empathize with our struggles and temptations against sin. However, it's important to note that experiencing something is not a prerequisite for understanding it. God, being all-knowing, comprehends every aspect of sin and temptation. Jesus can empathize with our temptations without having personally experienced each one.<p>Jesus faced temptations in the same three categories that are common to all humans: the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/1-John/2/1-John-2-16.html>1 John 2:16</a>). We see this pattern in the temptations faced by Eve in the Garden of Eden and Jesus in the wilderness. Despite being tempted in every way, Jesus remained perfectly holy. As believers, we too can overcome sin through Christ, no longer being slaves to sin but slaves of God (Romans 6).</p><iframe allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen frameborder=0 height=315 src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/MgzlgR3t8kI width=560></iframe><h3>Why This Matters</h3><p>Understanding whether Jesus could have sinned or not has theological implications. The belief in Jesus' impeccability highlights His divine nature and reinforces the idea that God is incapable of sinning. It affirms His sinless sacrifice on the cross as the perfect atonement for humanity's sins.<p>On the other hand, acknowledging that Jesus could have sinned but chose not to emphasizes His identification with humanity. It demonstrates His ability to empathize with our struggles and temptations, ultimately providing comfort and encouragement for believers facing their own battles against sin.<h3>Think About It</h3><p>Reflecting on this question can deepen our understanding of who Jesus is and how He relates to us. Consider the following questions:<ol><li>How does Jesus' impeccability affirm His divine nature?<li>In what ways does recognizing Jesus' ability to empathize with our temptations encourage you in your own struggles against sin?<li>How does Jesus' victory over temptation give you hope in overcoming your own temptations?</ol><p>By pondering these questions and studying Scripture, we can grow in our understanding of Jesus' nature and the significance of His sinlessness.</section><div class=author-info><img alt="Maisha Johnson" class=author-image loading=lazy src=https://biblebasedliving.com/images/profile.png><div class=author-details><h4>Maisha Johnson</h4><p>Written by Maisha Johnson, a dedicated Christian writer known for her inspiring narratives and deep spiritual insights.

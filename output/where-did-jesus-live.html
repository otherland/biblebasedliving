His journey began in heaven, where he was with God the Father before coming to earth (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/John/17/John-17-5.html>John 17:5</a>). The Gospel of John also tells us that Jesus, as the Word of God, was with God in the beginning (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/John/1/John-1-1.html>John 1:1-2</a>,14).<p>When Jesus was born, he came into the world in Bethlehem. The story of his birth is narrated in Luke 2. Although Mary and Joseph were from Nazareth, they traveled to Bethlehem for a census. They could not find a place to stay because they had no immediate family there. Jesus was born in a stable, but later on, the family moved to a house in Bethlehem where they received a visit from the wise men. King Herod learned of their visit and sought to kill Jesus as a potential rival. An angel warned Joseph in a dream, and the family fled to Egypt until Herod's death (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/2/Matthew-2-13.html>Matthew 2:13-15</a>).<p>After Herod's death, Joseph brought the family back to Nazareth (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/2/Matthew-2-23.html>Matthew 2:23</a>; <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/2/Luke-2-39.html>Luke 2:39</a>). Nazareth became Jesus' hometown where he grew up. This is why Jesus is often referred to as "Jesus of Nazareth" in the Bible.</p><iframe allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen frameborder=0 height=315 src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/nKIeZoOqkV4 width=560></iframe><p>Once Jesus began his public ministry, he moved his base of operations to Capernaum, located in Galilee near the shores of the Sea of Galilee (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/4/Matthew-4-13.html>Matthew 4:13</a>). From Capernaum, he made several trips to Jerusalem, where many significant events recorded in the Gospels took place.<p>It is important to note that Jesus did not have a permanent home or property of his own during his earthly ministry. In <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/9/Luke-9-57.html>Luke 9:57-58</a>, Jesus replied to someone who wanted to follow him by saying, "Foxes have dens and birds have nests, but the Son of Man has no place to lay his head." This indicates that Jesus did not have a home of his own and often stayed with friends or camped wherever he was during his itinerant ministry. For example, he was a guest at the home of Mary, Martha, and Lazarus in Bethany (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/10/Luke-10-38.html>Luke 10:38</a>).<p>After Jesus' resurrection, he ascended back to heaven and is now seated at the right hand of the Father (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Ephesians/1/Ephesians-1-20.html>Ephesians 1:20</a>; <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Colossians/3/Colossians-3-1.html>Colossians 3:1</a>; <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/8/Hebrews-8-1.html>Hebrews 8:1</a>). Jesus temporarily made his home on earth to secure a place for us in his Father's house (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/John/14/John-14-1.html>John 14:1-4</a>). In the future, all those who have put their faith in him will enjoy living in his presence, as described in <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Revelation/22/Revelation-22-1.html>Revelation 22:1-5</a>.<h3>Why This Matters</h3><p>Understanding where Jesus lived helps us grasp the significance of his life and ministry. It reinforces the fact that Jesus willingly left his heavenly home to come to earth, living among humanity to reconcile us to God. His birth in Bethlehem fulfilled prophecies and marked the beginning of God's redemptive plan. Jesus' time in Nazareth highlights his humble upbringing and identification with ordinary people. His ministry in Capernaum and visits to Jerusalem demonstrate the impact of his teachings and miracles on both Galilee and Judea.<h3>Think About It</h3><p>Reflecting on where Jesus lived reminds us that he experienced various settings and encountered diverse people throughout his life. This emphasizes his relatability and accessibility to all people, regardless of their background or circumstances. It also challenges us to consider how we can follow Jesus' example by being open and adaptable in our interactions with others, just as he was during his time on earth.</section><div class=author-info><img alt="Maisha Johnson" class=author-image loading=lazy src=https://biblebasedliving.com/images/profile.png><div class=author-details><h4>Maisha Johnson</h4><p>Written by Maisha Johnson, a dedicated Christian writer known for her inspiring narratives and deep spiritual insights.

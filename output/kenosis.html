Christ's "self-emptying" during His incarnation. This term is derived from the Greek word kenosis, which is found in <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Philippians/2/Philippians-2-7.html>Philippians 2:7</a>. The verse states that Jesus "emptied himself, by taking the form of a servant, being born in the likeness of men" (ESV). However, it is important to note that the verse does not explicitly mention what Jesus emptied Himself of. We must be cautious not to go beyond what Scripture reveals.<p>Contrary to some misconceptions, Jesus did not empty Himself of His divine attributes. The verse does not mention any specific attributes, and it is evident from the Gospels that Jesus possessed the power and wisdom of God. For instance, Jesus displayed His divine power by calming storms (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/4/Mark-4-39.html>Mark 4:39</a>). Therefore, in His incarnation, Jesus did not cease to be God, nor did He become a "lesser god." Instead, we should understand His "emptying" as a laying aside of the privileges He had in heaven.<p>Rather than remaining on His heavenly throne, Jesus chose to "make himself nothing" (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Philippians/2/Philippians-2-7.html>Philippians 2:7</a>, NIV) and gave up His divine privileges (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Philippians/2/Philippians-2-7.html>Philippians 2:7</a>, NLT). He veiled His glory and willingly took on the position of a servant. This self-renunciation was not an emptying of His deity or an exchange of deity for humanity. Throughout His earthly ministry, Jesus never ceased to be God. He set aside His heavenly glory and voluntarily refrained from using His divinity to ease His way. Instead, He fully submitted Himself to the will of the Father (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/John/5/John-5-19.html>John 5:19</a>).<p>As part of kenosis, Jesus sometimes operated within the limitations of humanity. Although God does not experience fatigue or thirst, Jesus did (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/John/4/John-4-6.html>John 4:6</a>; 19:28). While God is all-knowing, it seems that, at least once, Jesus voluntarily chose not to exercise His omniscience (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/24/Matthew-24-36.html>Matthew 24:36</a>). However, there were also instances where Jesus displayed His omniscience (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/6/Luke-6-8.html>Luke 6:8</a>; <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/John/13/John-13-11.html>John 13:11</a>; 18:4).</p><iframe allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen frameborder=0 height=315 src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/wgH5vOcd02g width=560></iframe><p>It is important to note that there are false teachers who take the concept of kenosis too far. They claim that Jesus gave up all or some of His divine nature during His earthly life. This heretical view is sometimes referred to as the kenosis theory. However, it is crucial to distinguish this erroneous teaching, known as kenoticism or kenotic theology, from the biblical understanding of kenosis.<p>When considering the kenosis, we often focus on what Jesus gave up. However, it is equally important to consider what He took on. In His humility for our sake, Jesus added a human nature to His divine nature. He went from being the glorious ruler in heaven to becoming a human being who ultimately suffered death on the cross. <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Philippians/2/Philippians-2-7.html>Philippians 2:7-8</a> declares that Jesus "took the very nature of a servant, being made in human likeness. And being found in appearance as a man, He humbled Himself and became obedient to death—even death on a cross!" This act of humility involved Christ taking on a human nature with all its limitations but without sin.<p><strong>Why This Matters</strong><p>Understanding the concept of kenosis helps us appreciate the depth of Christ's sacrifice and humility. It teaches us that Jesus willingly laid aside His heavenly privileges and took on the form of a servant for our salvation. Through the incarnation, Jesus identified with humanity and experienced our struggles firsthand. Recognizing this truth enables us to grasp the magnitude of God's love for us and motivates us to live in gratitude and obedience to Him.<p><strong>Think About It</strong><ol><li>How does the concept of kenosis challenge your understanding of Christ's incarnation?<li>In what ways does the self-emptying of Christ inspire you to live a life of humility and servanthood?<li>Reflect on the fact that Jesus willingly took on human limitations for our sake. How does this truth deepen your appreciation for His sacrifice?</ol></section><div class=author-info><img alt="Maisha Johnson" class=author-image loading=lazy src=https://biblebasedliving.com/images/profile.png><div class=author-details><h4>Maisha Johnson</h4><p>Written by Maisha Johnson, a dedicated Christian writer known for her inspiring narratives and deep spiritual insights.

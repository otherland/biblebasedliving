having all power. This concept is derived from the combination of the Latin words "omni," meaning "all," and "potens," meaning "power." It follows that if God is infinite and sovereign, then He must also be omnipotent. God has all power over all things at all times and in all ways.<h3>Creation and Preservation</h3><p>One of the clearest demonstrations of God's omnipotence is seen in the act of creation. In the book of Genesis, God spoke into existence everything that exists today. Unlike humans who require tools and materials to create, God simply spoke, and by the power of His word, everything came into being out of nothing. The psalmist affirms this when he says, "By the word of the LORD were the heavens made, their starry host by the breath of his mouth" (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/33/Psalm-33-6.html>Psalm 33:6</a>).<p>Furthermore, God's power extends to the preservation of His creation. Every aspect of life on earth is sustained by God's continual provision. He provides us with food, clothing, and shelter, all from renewable resources sustained by His power as the preserver of mankind and animals (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/36/Psalm-36-6.html>Psalm 36:6</a>). Even the vast seas are under His control, as He sets their limits so they do not overwhelm us (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Job/38/Job-38-8.html>Job 38:8-11</a>).<h3>Power Over Governments and Leaders</h3><p>God's omnipotence also extends to governments and leaders. He has the ability to restrain or allow them to go their own way according to His plans and purposes. The prophet Daniel acknowledges this when he says, "He changes times and seasons; he deposes kings and raises up others" (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Daniel/2/Daniel-2-21.html>Daniel 2:21</a>). Even Satan and his demons are subject to God's unlimited power. Satan's attack on Job was limited to certain actions because he was restrained by God's power (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Job/1/Job-1-12.html>Job 1:12</a>; 2:6). Jesus Himself reminded Pontius Pilate that the power Pilate had over Him was granted to him by God (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/John/19/John-19-11.html>John 19:11</a>).</p><iframe allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen frameborder=0 height=315 src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/I0nXG02tpDw width=560></iframe><h3>Limitations on God's Power</h3><p>While God is omnipotent, there are certain things that He cannot do because they are contrary to His holy character. For example, the Bible teaches that God cannot lie (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Numbers/23/Numbers-23-19.html>Numbers 23:19</a>, <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Titus/1/Titus-1-2.html>Titus 1:2</a>, <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/6/Hebrews-6-18.html>Hebrews 6:18</a>). Lying goes against His moral perfection. Similarly, although God is all-powerful and hates evil, He allows evil to happen according to His good purpose. He uses certain evil events to accomplish His plans, such as allowing the killing of Jesus Christ for the redemption of mankind.<h3>Jesus Christ's Omnipotence</h3><p>As God incarnate, Jesus Christ is also omnipotent. His power was evident in the miracles He performed during His earthly ministry. From healing the sick and feeding thousands of people with a few loaves and fishes to calming storms and raising the dead, Jesus displayed His control over life and death (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/6/Mark-6-30.html>Mark 6:30-44</a>; <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/4/Mark-4-37.html>Mark 4:37-41</a>; <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/John/11/John-11-38.html>John 11:38-44</a>; <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/5/Mark-5-35.html>Mark 5:35-43</a>). Ultimately, Jesus came to destroy death itself and bring sinners into a right relationship with God (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/1-Corinthians/15/1-Corinthians-15-22.html>1 Corinthians 15:22</a>; <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/2/Hebrews-2-14.html>Hebrews 2:14</a>). He willingly sacrificed Himself on the cross, even though He had the power to call upon legions of angels for protection (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/26/Matthew-26-53.html>Matthew 26:53</a>). Through His death and resurrection, Jesus demonstrated His ultimate power over sin and death.<h3>Believers Sharing in God's Power</h3><p>The amazing truth is that believers who are united with God through Jesus Christ can share in His power. The apostle Paul recognized this when he said, "Therefore I will boast all the more gladly about my weaknesses, so that Christ’s power may rest on me" (2 Corinthians 12:9b). When we are at our weakest, God's power is most evident in us. He is able to do more than we can ask or imagine by His power at work within us (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Ephesians/3/Ephesians-3-20.html>Ephesians 3:20</a>). Despite our sin, it is God's power that keeps us in a state of grace (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/2-Timothy/1/2-Timothy-1-12.html>2 Timothy 1:12</a>), and it is His power that keeps us from falling (Jude 24). Throughout eternity, the host of heaven will proclaim God's power (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Revelation/19/Revelation-19-1.html>Revelation 19:1</a>).<h3>Why This Matters</h3><p>Understanding God's omnipotence is crucial for believers because it reminds us of His sovereignty and control over all things. It reassures us that nothing is beyond God's reach or ability. It encourages us to trust in His power to accomplish His purposes in our lives and in the world. Recognizing God's omnipotence also helps us to surrender our weaknesses and allow Christ's power to work through us, displaying His glory to others.<h3>Think About It</h3><ul><li>Reflect on times when you have seen or experienced God's power in your life. How did it affect your faith and trust in Him?<li>Consider how recognizing God's omnipotence can bring comfort and assurance in difficult circumstances.<li>In what ways can you allow Christ's power to work through your weaknesses? How might this impact your daily life and relationships?</ul><p>In conclusion, God's omnipotence is an essential aspect of His character. He has all power over all things at all times and in all ways. From creation to preservation, from governments to miracles, God's power is evident throughout the Bible. As believers, we have the privilege of sharing in His power through our union with Jesus Christ. Recognizing God's omnipotence strengthens our faith, encourages us to trust in His sovereign control, and empowers us to live for His glory.</section><div class=author-info><img alt="Maisha Johnson" class=author-image loading=lazy src=https://biblebasedliving.com/images/profile.png><div class=author-details><h4>Maisha Johnson</h4><p>Written by Maisha Johnson, a dedicated Christian writer known for her inspiring narratives and deep spiritual insights.

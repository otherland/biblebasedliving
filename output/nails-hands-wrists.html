Crucifixion of Jesus</h2><p>In discussing the crucifixion of Jesus, one question that arises is where exactly the nails were placed. This question is closely tied to the debate surrounding whether Jesus was crucified on a cross, pole, or stake. Some scientists argue that if Jesus was crucified on a cross, as tradition states, the hands alone would not have been strong enough to hold His weight. Consequently, they suggest that the nails were actually driven through His wrists, which are considered stronger and more capable of supporting His body.<p>However, there are differing views on this matter. Some scholars propose that the hands would have been strong enough to bear the weight, considering that Jesus' feet were also nailed to support some of the burden. Additionally, historical evidence suggests that some crosses had a sort of seat attached to them, which would have helped support the weight of the person being crucified.<p>While historical scholars remain uncertain about the precise placement of the nails in Jesus' crucifixion (or anyone else's for that matter), it is important to note that the Bible simply states that Jesus had wounds in His hands (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/John/20/John-20-25.html>John 20:25-27</a>). The Greek word translated as "hands" in this context is "cheir," which literally means "hands." Interestingly, there is no Greek word for "wrists" in the New Testament, although some versions translate <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Acts/12/Acts-12-7.html>Acts 12:7</a> to say that Peter's chains fell off his wrists. However, the Greek word used in this verse is also "cheir."<p>It is possible that the nails may have been angled to enter through the hand and exit through the wrist, but it is equally likely that they were driven straight through the hand near the base of the thumb. Various experiments have shown that both methods could have been used in Jesus' crucifixion.</p><iframe allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen frameborder=0 height=315 src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/LTHAwL8p9qU width=560></iframe><p>From a spiritual perspective, it is essential to recognize that the wounds of Christ hold infinite significance and are an integral part of His glory. However, the exact location of these wounds is a minor issue. What matters most is that we know there were five wounds - in His hands, side, and feet. Although we do not know the precise location on the hands, side, or feet, we understand that it is through His wounds that we find healing from sin (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/53/Isaiah-53-5.html>Isaiah 53:5</a>; <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/1-Peter/2/1-Peter-2-24.html>1 Peter 2:24</a>). The wounds on Jesus' body brought about spiritual healing for all who believe in Him.<h3>Why This Matters</h3><p>Understanding the details of Jesus' crucifixion and the placement of the nails helps us appreciate the immense sacrifice He made for our salvation. It also allows us to contemplate the physical pain and suffering He endured on our behalf. By delving into these aspects of Jesus' crucifixion, we gain a deeper understanding of His love and the magnitude of what He accomplished on the cross.<h3>Think About It</h3><ol><li>Reflect on the significance of Jesus' wounds and how they provide spiritual healing for those who believe in Him.<li>Consider how Jesus willingly endured physical pain and suffering to offer redemption to humanity. How does this impact your understanding of His love for you?<li>Contemplate the importance of the crucifixion in your own faith journey and how it shapes your relationship with Jesus.</ol></section><div class=author-info><img alt="Maisha Johnson" class=author-image loading=lazy src=https://biblebasedliving.com/images/profile.png><div class=author-details><h4>Maisha Johnson</h4><p>Written by Maisha Johnson, a dedicated Christian writer known for her inspiring narratives and deep spiritual insights.

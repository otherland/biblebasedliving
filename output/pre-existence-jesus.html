walked upon the earth, he already existed as the second person of the triune God. This doctrine is explicitly taught in the Bible and can be seen through various passages in the Gospels and Epistles. Jesus himself affirmed his own pre-existence, and his actions further revealed his divine identity.<h3>Jesus' Explicit Teaching</h3><p>Jesus explicitly taught his pre-existence on multiple occasions. In <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/John/17/John-17-5.html>John 17:5</a>, Jesus said, "And now, Father, glorify me in your presence with the glory I had with you before the world began." This statement clearly indicates that Jesus existed in glory with the Father before the creation of the world. Additionally, in several other verses such as <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/John/3/John-3-13.html>John 3:13</a>; 6:33, 38, 62; 8:23; and 16:28, Jesus directly asserts his pre-existence.<h3>The Father-Son Relationship</h3><p>Several passages in the New Testament present Jesus as pre-existing with his Father. <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/8/Romans-8-3.html>Romans 8:3</a>, <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/1-John/1/1-John-1-2.html>1 John 1:2</a>, and <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Galatians/4/Galatians-4-4.html>Galatians 4:4</a> all highlight this aspect of Jesus' pre-existence. Furthermore, there are texts that identify Jesus as the Creator, such as <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/John/1/John-1-2.html>John 1:2</a>–3, <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Colossians/1/Colossians-1-16.html>Colossians 1:16</a>–17, and <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/1/Hebrews-1-2.html>Hebrews 1:2</a>. These verses emphasize that Jesus was not just a created being but actively involved in the act of creation.<h3>Evidence from Jesus' Actions</h3><p>One of the most compelling pieces of evidence for the pre-existence of Christ is found in his actions. Jesus often performed acts that only God had the authority or power to do. For example, in <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/2/Mark-2-3.html>Mark 2:3</a>–12, Jesus healed a paralytic to demonstrate his authority and ability to forgive sins. This action was reserved only for Yahweh, and Jesus' Jewish audience would have recognized this. Similarly, in <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/7/Luke-7-48.html>Luke 7:48</a>–50, Jesus' actions drew a similar reaction. These instances point to Jesus' divine identity and therefore his pre-existence.<h3>Worship and Authority</h3><p>Jesus was the object of worship in the Gospels, and he never rejected such adoration. Verses like <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/28/Matthew-28-9.html>Matthew 28:9</a>, 17; <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/24/Luke-24-52.html>Luke 24:52</a>; <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/John/9/John-9-38.html>John 9:38</a>; and 20:28 show people worshiping Jesus without him rebuking them. This acceptance of worship implies his divinity. Additionally, Jesus claimed authority over the Sabbath (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/2/Mark-2-28.html>Mark 2:28</a>) and even the authority to abolish the Law (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Ephesians/2/Ephesians-2-14.html>Ephesians 2:14</a>–15). Such claims would be blasphemous if made by anyone other than a divine and pre-existent person.</p><iframe allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen frameborder=0 height=315 src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/3p7Um5RK97Y width=560></iframe><h3>The Son of Man</h3><p>Jesus identified himself as the divine Son of Man in <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/14/Mark-14-61.html>Mark 14:61</a>–64. This title reflects his unique position as both fully human and fully divine. Jesus also claimed to have the power to raise himself from the dead in <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/John/10/John-10-17.html>John 10:17</a>–18. This resurrection became the ultimate proof of his claims and ministry, demonstrating his divine authority and thus confirming his pre-existence.<h3>Why This Matters</h3><p>Understanding the pre-existence of Jesus is crucial for establishing his divine nature and authority. It confirms that Jesus is not merely a human prophet or teacher but the eternal Son of God who existed before time began. This belief is foundational to Christian theology and shapes our understanding of salvation through Jesus' sacrificial death and resurrection.<h3>Think About It</h3><p>Consider the implications of Jesus' pre-existence for your faith. How does knowing that Jesus existed before creation affect your understanding of his teachings and actions? Reflect on how this truth deepens your appreciation for Jesus' sacrifice on the cross and the significance of his resurrection. Embrace the reality that Jesus is not just a historical figure but the eternal Son of God who offers salvation and hope to all who believe in him.</section><div class=author-info><img alt="Maisha Johnson" class=author-image loading=lazy src=https://biblebasedliving.com/images/profile.png><div class=author-details><h4>Maisha Johnson</h4><p>Written by Maisha Johnson, a dedicated Christian writer known for her inspiring narratives and deep spiritual insights.

detailed portrait of who He is. Throughout Scripture, we see that God is a loving Father to all believers (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Ephesians/1/Ephesians-1-2.html>Ephesians 1:2</a>; <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Galatians/1/Galatians-1-1.html>Galatians 1:1</a>; <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Colossians/1/Colossians-1-12.html>Colossians 1:12</a>; <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/1-Thessalonians/1/1-Thessalonians-1-3.html>1 Thessalonians 1:3</a>). He is wholly good, and His goodness is unmatched (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/10/Mark-10-18.html>Mark 10:18</a>; <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/1-Timothy/4/1-Timothy-4-4.html>1 Timothy 4:4</a>). We can trust in Him because He is a refuge in times of trouble and cares for those who trust in Him (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Nahum/1/Nahum-1-7.html>Nahum 1:7</a>).<p><strong>Why This Matters:</strong> Understanding the character of God helps us build a relationship with Him. It gives us confidence to trust in His goodness and seek refuge in Him during difficult times.<p><strong>Think About It:</strong> How does knowing that God is good and cares for you impact your daily life?<p>God's holiness is unequaled, and there is no stain of evil or impurity in Him (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/1-Samuel/2/1-Samuel-2-2.html>1 Samuel 2:2</a>; <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/1-John/1/1-John-1-5.html>1 John 1:5</a>). His righteousness is another defining characteristic, meaning He exists in a state of moral perfection (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/3/Romans-3-25.html>Romans 3:25</a>–26). God is also just, treating His creation with perfect fairness (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/30/Isaiah-30-18.html>Isaiah 30:18</a>).<p><strong>Why This Matters:</strong> Recognizing God's holiness, righteousness, and justice helps us understand that He always acts in accordance with what is right and fair.<p><strong>Think About It:</strong> How does knowing that God is just impact your view of His actions in the world?<p>Loving, compassionate, gracious, kind, and merciful are central descriptions of God's character (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Nehemiah/9/Nehemiah-9-31.html>Nehemiah 9:31</a>). Scripture tells us that "God is love" (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/1-John/4/1-John-4-8.html>1 John 4:8</a>, 16) and that His love for us is so great that He gave His one and only Son, Jesus, so that we may have eternal life (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/John/3/John-3-16.html>John 3:16</a>). God's mercy and compassion never fail; they are renewed every day (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Lamentations/3/Lamentations-3-22.html>Lamentations 3:22</a>–23).<p><strong>Why This Matters:</strong> Recognizing God's love, compassion, and mercy helps us understand His willingness to forgive us and His desire to have a relationship with us.<p><strong>Think About It:</strong> How does experiencing God's love and mercy impact the way you view yourself and others?<p>Part of God's character is also faithfulness. He is faithful to forgive us when we confess our sins and return to Him (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/1-John/1/1-John-1-9.html>1 John 1:9</a>). Even when we are unfaithful, God remains faithful because that is who He is (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/2-Timothy/2/2-Timothy-2-13.html>2 Timothy 2:13</a>). God is also truthful, and His Word is true (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/1-John/5/1-John-5-20.html>1 John 5:20</a>). We can rely on His promises because of His trustworthy character.</p><iframe allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen frameborder=0 height=315 src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/nxwzq1PJImM width=560></iframe><p><strong>Why This Matters:</strong> Understanding God's faithfulness and truthfulness gives us confidence in His promises and the reliability of His Word.<p><strong>Think About It:</strong> How does knowing that God is faithful impact your trust in Him?<p>God is patient and longsuffering, "slow to anger," giving sinners time for repentance (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Exodus/34/Exodus-34-6.html>Exodus 34:6</a>; <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Numbers/14/Numbers-14-18.html>Numbers 14:18</a>). He desires to be a Father to all who draw near to Him (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/68/Psalm-68-5.html>Psalm 68:5</a>; <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Ephesians/4/Ephesians-4-6.html>Ephesians 4:6</a>). God's character also includes other attributes such as being all-knowing, all-powerful, ever-present, perfect, and three-in-one.<p><strong>Why This Matters:</strong> Recognizing God's patience and desire to be our Father encourages us to draw near to Him and seek a relationship with Him.<p><strong>Think About It:</strong> How does knowing that God desires to be your Father impact your perception of Him?<p>The more we dig into Scripture, the more we will uncover new facets of God's character. Spending time with Him helps us know and understand His nature better. God never changes, and He is always present in our lives (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Malachi/3/Malachi-3-6.html>Malachi 3:6</a>; <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/13/Hebrews-13-8.html>Hebrews 13:8</a>; <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/139/Psalm-139-7.html>Psalm 139:7</a>–10). He is the foundation for life, and His Word is trustworthy (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/12/Psalm-12-6.html>Psalm 12:6</a>; <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/John/17/John-17-17.html>John 17:17</a>). We can count on Him to fulfill His promises because of His unchanging character.<p><strong>Why This Matters:</strong> Recognizing God's unchanging nature gives us confidence in His reliability and the truth of His Word.<p><strong>Think About It:</strong> How does knowing that God is unchanging impact your trust in Him?<p>In conclusion, the character of God as revealed in the Bible is filled with goodness, holiness, righteousness, justice, love, compassion, mercy, faithfulness, truthfulness, patience, and longsuffering. Understanding these aspects of God's character helps us build a deeper relationship with Him and navigate our lives with confidence in His unwavering nature.<p>Remember that God's character impacts every aspect of our lives. It shapes how we view ourselves, how we interact with others, and how we approach challenges. Take time to reflect on the character of God and seek to align your life with His attributes.</section><div class=author-info><img alt="Maisha Johnson" class=author-image loading=lazy src=https://biblebasedliving.com/images/profile.png><div class=author-details><h4>Maisha Johnson</h4><p>Written by Maisha Johnson, a dedicated Christian writer known for her inspiring narratives and deep spiritual insights.

describe the coming Messiah, Jesus Christ. In the book of Isaiah, the prophet Isaiah predicts the birth of a child who will fulfill the Davidic Covenant and bear the titles "Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace" (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/9/Isaiah-9-6.html>Isaiah 9:6</a>). This prophecy was written nearly 800 years before the birth of Christ and served as a message of hope for the people of Israel during a tumultuous time.<h3>The Character of the Messiah</h3><p>When Isaiah refers to the Messiah as the "Wonderful Counselor," he is highlighting the extraordinary character of this coming King. The word "wonderful" in this context means "incomprehensible" or beyond our understanding. It is a word that emphasizes the awe-inspiring nature of Jesus. He is wonderful in a way that surpasses anything we can grasp or comprehend.<p>Jesus demonstrated His wonderfulness in various ways during His time on earth. His conception in the womb of a virgin was a miraculous event that showcased His divine nature (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/1/Matthew-1-23.html>Matthew 1:23</a>). He displayed His wonderfulness through His power to heal, His amazing teaching, His perfect life, and His resurrection from the dead. Everything about Jesus is awe-inspiring and superior to any other kind of wonder. He is perfect in every way.<h3>Jesus as a Wise Counselor</h3><p>The second part of the Messiah's title, "Counselor," portrays Jesus as a wise king who provides guidance to His people. In ancient Israel, a counselor was seen as someone with wisdom and insight, like King Solomon. Isaiah also uses this term to describe the LORD in another passage (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/28/Isaiah-28-29.html>Isaiah 28:29</a>), saying that He is "wonderful in counsel and excellent in wisdom."<p>Jesus is not just any counselor; He is uniquely qualified to advise us because He possesses all wisdom and knowledge. In Him are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Colossians/2/Colossians-2-3.html>Colossians 2:3</a>). He understands human nature perfectly and knows what is in each person's heart (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/John/2/John-2-25.html>John 2:25</a>). Jesus always knows the right course of action and can guide us with His infinite wisdom.</p><iframe allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen frameborder=0 height=315 src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/j6Mw5OPCRTQ width=560></iframe><h3>Trusting Jesus as Our Wonderful Counselor</h3><p>As believers, we can trust Jesus as our Wonderful Counselor to listen to our problems and provide guidance. He encourages us to bring our worries to Him in prayer (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Philippians/4/Philippians-4-6.html>Philippians 4:6</a>; <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/James/1/James-1-5.html>James 1:5</a>) and promises to guide our paths if we acknowledge Him in all our ways (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Proverbs/3/Proverbs-3-6.html>Proverbs 3:6</a>). We can have confidence that He has our best interests at heart because He loves us unconditionally (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/1-John/4/1-John-4-19.html>1 John 4:19</a>).<p>The love of Christ is so deep and wonderful that it is beyond our full understanding (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/5/Romans-5-8.html>Romans 5:8</a>). His role as our Wonderful Counselor assures us that He understands what we are going through and knows how to lead us. We can rely on His wisdom and trust that His counsel will always be for our ultimate good.<h3>Why This Matters</h3><p>Understanding Jesus as the Wonderful Counselor is crucial for our faith. It reminds us that we have access to divine wisdom and guidance through Him. In a world filled with uncertainty, confusion, and conflicting advice, knowing that we can turn to Jesus for counsel brings comfort and assurance. His perfect understanding of our needs and His infinite wisdom equip Him to guide us through any situation we face.<h3>Think About It</h3><ol><li>How does viewing Jesus as the Wonderful Counselor impact your perspective on seeking guidance in your life?<li>In what areas of your life do you need the counsel of Jesus? How can you seek His guidance more intentionally?<li>Reflect on instances where you have experienced the wisdom and guidance of Jesus in your life. How did it affect your decisions and outcomes?</ol><p>Remember, Jesus is not just a counselor; He is the Wonderful Counselor who can guide us with His perfect wisdom. Take comfort in knowing that you have access to divine counsel through Him and seek His guidance in every aspect of your life.</section><div class=author-info><img alt="Maisha Johnson" class=author-image loading=lazy src=https://biblebasedliving.com/images/profile.png><div class=author-details><h4>Maisha Johnson</h4><p>Written by Maisha Johnson, a dedicated Christian writer known for her inspiring narratives and deep spiritual insights.

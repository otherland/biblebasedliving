For instance, <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/43/Isaiah-43-25.html>Isaiah 43:25</a> says, “I, even I, am he who blots out your transgressions, for my own sake, and remembers your sins no more.” Additionally, Hebrews 10 explains how Jesus' sacrifice on the cross for sin was a once-and-for-all sacrifice. Unlike the sacrificial system of the Old Testament, in which sacrifices were continually made for sin, Jesus paid for sin completely. <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/10/Hebrews-10-14.html>Hebrews 10:14</a>–18 states, “For by one sacrifice he has made perfect forever those who are being made holy. The Holy Spirit also testifies to us about this. First he says: ‘This is the covenant I will make with them after that time, says the Lord. I will put my laws in their hearts, and I will write them on their minds.’ Then he adds: ‘Their sins and lawless acts I will remember no more.’ And where these have been forgiven, sacrifice for sin is no longer necessary.” These passages make it clear that God does not remember our sins.<p>However, it's important to note that God's "not remembering" is not the same as human forgetfulness. God is omniscient and knows everything; He does not forget anything. Instead, when the Bible talks about God not remembering our sins, it means that He chooses not to bring them up or hold them against us. In human relationships, we can choose to remember the offenses someone has committed against us or choose to forget. To forgive someone, we often need to put painful memories out of our minds. Forgiveness allows us to move forward without dwelling on past troubles.</p><iframe allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen frameborder=0 height=315 src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/l42NpoAdJQ8 width=560></iframe><p>Rather than treating us as our sins deserve, God removes our sins from us as far as the east is from the west—an immeasurable distance (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/103/Psalm-103-12.html>Psalm 103:12</a>). Think of traveling around the globe. When do you stop going east and start going west? It is impossible to say. When we are saved, our sins are completely forgiven. This is what the writer of Hebrews is talking about—Jesus made a one-time sacrifice that completely removes our sin. In Christ, we are justified (declared righteous) before God. <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/8/Romans-8-1.html>Romans 8:1</a> tells us there is no condemnation for those who are in Christ. <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/8/Romans-8-31.html>Romans 8:31</a>–39 beautifully discusses our security in Christ. Sin has no say in our standing with God. We are fully accepted and declared righteous in Him. God does not remember our sins in the way He treats us; instead, He treats us as righteous.<p>Even as Christians, we still sin, but we know that God is faithful to forgive us when we confess our sins (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/1-John/1/1-John-1-9.html>1 John 1:9</a>). God cleanses us, and then He moves on. He does not hold our sins over us. Instead, He frees us from the slavery of sin and sets us free to experience a new life in Him. Knowing the complete forgiveness of God in Christ, we can join King Hezekiah in praising our Redeemer: “You have put all my sins behind your back” (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/38/Isaiah-38-17.html>Isaiah 38:17</a>). Like Paul, we can forget what is behind and press on toward the goal to win the prize for which God has called us heavenward in Christ Jesus (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Philippians/3/Philippians-3-13.html>Philippians 3:13</a>).<h3>Why This Matters</h3><p>Understanding that God forgives and does not remember our sins has significant implications for our relationship with Him and how we view ourselves. It means that once we have confessed our sins and received forgiveness through faith in Jesus Christ, there is no longer any condemnation for us (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/8/Romans-8-1.html>Romans 8:1</a>). We can have confidence that we are completely forgiven and accepted by God. This knowledge should bring us great comfort and peace, knowing that our past sins do not define us or separate us from God's love.<p>Furthermore, understanding God's forgiveness should also shape how we relate to others. Just as God chooses not to remember our sins, we are called to forgive others and let go of their offenses against us. Forgiveness allows us to experience healing, restoration, and reconciliation in our relationships. It frees us from the burden of holding onto resentment and bitterness. The example set by God's forgiveness should inspire us to extend the same grace and mercy to others.<h3>Think About It</h3><ol><li>How does understanding God's forgiveness impact your view of yourself and your relationship with Him?<li>In what ways can you apply the concept of forgiveness in your relationships with others?<li>Reflect on the freedom and peace that comes from knowing that God does not hold your past sins against you.</ol></section><div class=author-info><img alt="Maisha Johnson" class=author-image loading=lazy src=https://biblebasedliving.com/images/profile.png><div class=author-details><h4>Maisha Johnson</h4><p>Written by Maisha Johnson, a dedicated Christian writer known for her inspiring narratives and deep spiritual insights.

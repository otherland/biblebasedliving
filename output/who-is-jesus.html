While most people accept that Jesus was a historical figure who lived in Israel 2,000 years ago, the debate arises when discussing his full identity. The Bible presents Jesus as more than just a prophet, good teacher, or godly man. In fact, Jesus claimed to be God in the flesh. This article will explore the biblical evidence for Jesus' divinity and why it matters.<h3>Jesus Claimed to be God</h3><p>Jesus' claim to be God is a central aspect of his identity. In <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/John/10/John-10-30.html>John 10:30</a>, Jesus said, "I and the Father are one." Although this statement may not immediately appear to be a claim of divinity, the Jews understood it as such and attempted to stone him for blasphemy. Jesus never sought to correct their understanding. In fact, in <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/John/8/John-8-58.html>John 8:58</a>, he proclaimed, "Before Abraham was born, I am!" Using the phrase "I am," Jesus applied a name for God (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Exodus/3/Exodus-3-14.html>Exodus 3:14</a>) to himself. Again, the Jews reacted with anger and tried to stone him.</p><iframe allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen frameborder=0 height=315 src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/R9qoqQ75ifs width=560></iframe><h3>The Witness of Scripture</h3><p>The Bible provides further evidence of Jesus' divinity. In <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/John/1/John-1-1.html>John 1:1</a>, it states that "the Word was God," and in <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/John/1/John-1-14.html>John 1:14</a>, it declares that "the Word became flesh." This refers to Jesus as the Word made flesh, emphasizing his divine nature taking on human form. Additionally, when Thomas encountered the resurrected Jesus, he exclaimed, "My Lord and my God" (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/John/20/John-20-28.html>John 20:28</a>). Jesus did not correct Thomas but affirmed his belief. The apostle Paul also referred to Jesus as "our great God and Savior" (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Titus/2/Titus-2-13.html>Titus 2:13</a>), and Peter called him "our God and Savior" (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/2-Peter/1/2-Peter-1-1.html>2 Peter 1:1</a>).<p>Another significant testimony comes from God the Father himself. <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/1/Hebrews-1-8.html>Hebrews 1:8</a> quotes <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/45/Psalm-45-6.html>Psalm 45:6</a>, saying, "But about the Son, he says, 'Your throne, O God, will last forever and ever.'" This confirms Jesus' divine identity as the Son of God. Old Testament prophecies, such as <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/9/Isaiah-9-6.html>Isaiah 9:6</a>, also point to Jesus' deity by describing him as the "Wonderful Counselor," "Mighty God," "Everlasting Father," and "Prince of Peace."<h3>Jesus' Role as Mediator and Savior</h3><p>The question of Jesus' identity as God is essential because it determines his role as the mediator between humanity and God. Jesus had to be both fully God and fully human to accomplish this. As God, Jesus could satisfy God's wrath for sin, and as a man, he had the capability to die on behalf of humanity. This unique combination makes him the perfect mediator (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/1-Timothy/2/1-Timothy-2-5.html>1 Timothy 2:5</a>). In <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/John/14/John-14-6.html>John 14:6</a>, Jesus declared, "I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me." Salvation is only available through faith in Jesus Christ.<h3>Why This Matters</h3><p>Understanding and accepting Jesus' divinity has significant implications for Christians. It affirms that salvation is found in Jesus alone. Believing in Jesus as God means recognizing his authority and submitting to his teachings. It also provides assurance of eternal life because only God himself could offer an infinite, eternally valuable sacrifice for our sins.<h3>Think About It</h3><p>Consider the significance of Jesus' claim to be God. If he is not truly divine, then he would either be a liar or a lunatic. However, if he is indeed who he claimed to be—the Son of God—then acknowledging his divinity demands a response from us. We must decide whether we will accept him as Lord and Savior or reject him altogether. This decision has eternal implications.<p>In conclusion, the biblical evidence supports Jesus' claim to be God in the flesh. The witness of Scripture, the reactions of the Jews, and the affirmations from Thomas, Paul, Peter, and God the Father all point to Jesus' divine identity. Understanding and accepting this truth is vital for salvation and a personal relationship with God. As Christians, we are called to recognize Jesus as our Lord and Savior—the way, the truth, and the life.</section><div class=author-info><img alt="Maisha Johnson" class=author-image loading=lazy src=https://biblebasedliving.com/images/profile.png><div class=author-details><h4>Maisha Johnson</h4><p>Written by Maisha Johnson, a dedicated Christian writer known for her inspiring narratives and deep spiritual insights.

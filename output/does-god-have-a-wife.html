While some historians argue for this position, there is actually no evidence to support it. The most common assertion is that God and a mother goddess named Asherah were originally considered a couple in ancient Israelite religion. However, there is no evidence of manipulation in the Old Testament manuscripts to remove Asherah as God's wife.<p>The Bible presents marriage as an institution created by God for humankind alone. In Genesis 2, God recognizes that it is not good for man to be alone and creates a suitable helper for him, which is woman. This establishes marriage as the physical and spiritual union between a husband and wife. Therefore, God does not need a wife or companion because He has always existed in a loving relationship within the triune being of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.<p>Furthermore, there is biblical evidence that suggests marriage will become obsolete in the eternal state. Jesus addressed a hypothetical question from the Sadducees about marriage in the next life and stated that people will neither marry nor be given in marriage (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/22/Matthew-22-30.html>Matthew 22:30</a>). This indicates that marriage is a temporary institution designed for human beings in this life only.<p>The pagan religions often depicted their false gods with wives, consorts, and love interests. However, the One True God of the Bible is distinct from these idols. There is no evidence in Scripture to suggest that God has ever been portrayed as having a wife. The Scriptures also demonstrate why God does not need marriage and why marriage itself is designed by God exclusively for human beings in this life.<h3>Why This Matters</h3><iframe allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen frameborder=0 height=315 src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/5sw-NFvueK8 width=560></iframe><p>Understanding whether God has a wife or not may seem like an obscure topic, but it actually has significant implications for our understanding of who God is and the nature of marriage. Recognizing that God does not have a wife emphasizes His self-sufficiency and completeness within the Trinity. It also highlights the unique purpose of marriage as an earthly institution designed for human companionship and procreation.<h3>Think About It</h3><p>Consider the significance of God's self-sufficiency and completeness within the Trinity. How does this understanding shape your understanding of God's character and relationship with humanity? How does recognizing the temporary nature of marriage in the eternal state impact your perspective on the purpose of marriage in this life?</section><div class=author-info><img alt="Maisha Johnson" class=author-image loading=lazy src=https://biblebasedliving.com/images/profile.png><div class=author-details><h4>Maisha Johnson</h4><p>Written by Maisha Johnson, a dedicated Christian writer known for her inspiring narratives and deep spiritual insights.

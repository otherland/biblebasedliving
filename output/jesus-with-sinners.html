of society. One notable instance is when Jesus ate a meal with "many tax collectors and sinners" at Matthew's house (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/2/Mark-2-15.html>Mark 2:15</a>). This act drew criticism from the scribes and Pharisees, who considered themselves righteous and looked down upon those they deemed as sinners. However, Jesus' actions were in line with His mission to seek and save the lost (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/19/Luke-19-10.html>Luke 19:10</a>).<h3>The Pharisees' Attitude towards Sinners</h3><p>During Jesus' time, the Pharisees held positions of high esteem in Jewish society. They were strict adherents to the Law and were seen as exemplars of piety. However, they avoided those they considered sinners, such as tax collectors, who were notorious for embezzlement and collaborating with the Romans. The Pharisees believed that by keeping their distance from sinners, they maintained their own righteousness.<h3>Jesus' Purpose in Eating with Sinners</h3><p>Jesus chose to eat with sinners because they were the ones who needed to know that repentance and forgiveness were available. As Jesus' ministry grew, He became more popular among the social outcasts of society. Since Matthew was now part of His inner circle, Jesus naturally had more contact with these pariahs. It was important for Him to spend time with them in order to reach the lost. After all, Jesus said, "It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick" (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/5/Luke-5-31.html>Luke 5:31</a>).</p><iframe allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen frameborder=0 height=315 src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/w5GXnM_TxSQ width=560></iframe><p>By sitting at Matthew's feast and eating with sinners, Jesus challenged societal taboos and condemned the legalistic mindset of the Pharisees. He looked beyond cultural norms and saw people's hearts. While the Pharisees disregarded individuals based on their past behavior, Jesus recognized their spiritual need for repentance and forgiveness.<h3>Jesus' Compassion for Sinners</h3><p>Throughout His ministry, Jesus consistently reached out to those who needed Him. He engaged in conversation with a despised Samaritan woman, surprising even His disciples (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/John/4/John-4-27.html>John 4:27</a>). He forgave an immoral woman in Luke 7, helped a Syro-Phoenician woman in Mark 7, touched a leper in Luke 5, and dined with Zacchaeus in Luke 19. In all these instances, Jesus showed compassion and love to the untouchable and unloved.<p>Jesus came to save sinners. He did not come to condemn the world but to offer salvation (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/John/3/John-3-17.html>John 3:17</a>). Jesus saw individuals beyond their labels and recognized their need for a Savior. The miracles He performed were a testament to His righteousness, and sinners were drawn to Him because of His compassion and sincerity.<h3>Lessons from Jesus' Interaction with Sinners</h3><p>Jesus' interactions with sinners teach us valuable lessons. First, we should not let social status or cultural norms dictate our relationships with people. Just as Jesus sought out the lost sheep wherever they had strayed, we too should be willing to reach out to those who need to hear the good news of the kingdom. We must not be deterred by criticism or judgment from self-righteous individuals.<p>Secondly, Jesus did not require people to change before coming to Him. Instead, He met them where they were and extended grace to them in their circumstances. Change would come from the inside out for those who accepted Christ. As believers, we should follow Jesus' example by showing kindness and compassion, understanding that it is God's kindness that leads people to repentance (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/2/Romans-2-4.html>Romans 2:4</a>).<h3>Why This Matters</h3><p>Understanding Jesus' interactions with sinners is important because it challenges us to examine our own attitudes towards those we may consider as sinners or outcasts. We are called to love and show compassion to all people, just as Jesus did. By following His example, we can be effective ambassadors for Christ and bring the message of salvation to those who need it most.<h3>Think About It</h3><ol><li>Reflect on how Jesus' interactions with sinners challenge your own attitudes towards those who may be considered outcasts in society.<li>Are there any individuals or groups of people that you tend to avoid or judge? How can you show them the love and compassion of Christ?<li>Consider how Jesus' approach to evangelism differs from the legalistic mindset of the Pharisees. How can you adopt a similar approach in sharing the gospel with others?</ol></section><div class=author-info><img alt="Maisha Johnson" class=author-image loading=lazy src=https://biblebasedliving.com/images/profile.png><div class=author-details><h4>Maisha Johnson</h4><p>Written by Maisha Johnson, a dedicated Christian writer known for her inspiring narratives and deep spiritual insights.

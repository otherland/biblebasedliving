banners pulled across the sky. While it is a popular slogan, many people do not fully understand its meaning. In this article, we will explore the profound truth behind these two words and why they hold so much power.<h3>The Identity of Jesus</h3><p>Most people recognize Jesus as a man who lived in Israel about 2,000 years ago. He is often viewed as a good teacher and prophet in various religions. However, Jesus is much more than that. According to the Bible, Jesus is God in human form (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/John/1/John-1-1.html>John 1:1</a>, 14). He came to Earth as a true human being (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/1-John/4/1-John-4-2.html>1 John 4:2</a>) in the person of Jesus Christ with the purpose of saving us. Understanding who Jesus truly is lays the foundation for comprehending how and why He saves.<h3>The Need for Salvation</h3><p>The Bible teaches that every human being has sinned (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Ecclesiastes/7/Ecclesiastes-7-20.html>Ecclesiastes 7:20</a>; <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/3/Romans-3-23.html>Romans 3:23</a>). Sin involves any thought, word, or deed that contradicts God's perfect and holy character. Because of our sin, we are separated from God and deserving of His judgment (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/John/3/John-3-18.html>John 3:18</a>, 36). As a perfectly just God, He cannot allow sin to go unpunished. Since all sin ultimately goes against Him (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/51/Psalm-51-4.html>Psalm 51:4</a>), only an infinite and eternal punishment is sufficient. Eternal death, which is separation from God, is the just punishment for sin. This is why we need to be saved.<h3>The Salvation Plan</h3><p>Because we have sinned against an infinite God, there are only two options for justice. Either each one of us as finite individuals would have to pay for our sins for an infinite amount of time, or an infinite Person (Jesus) must pay for our sins once. Jesus saves us by taking our place and dying for our sins. He sacrificed Himself on our behalf, paying the infinite and eternal penalty that only He could pay (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/2-Corinthians/5/2-Corinthians-5-21.html>2 Corinthians 5:21</a>; <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/1-John/2/1-John-2-2.html>1 John 2:2</a>). Jesus took the punishment we deserved in order to save us from an eternal destiny separated from God. His act of love led Him to lay down His life (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/John/15/John-15-13.html>John 15:13</a>) and pay the penalty we had earned but could not pay. Three days later, Jesus rose from the dead, demonstrating the sufficiency of His death to pay for our sins and His victory over death on our behalf (1 Corinthians 15).<h3>Receiving Salvation</h3><p>Jesus saves all who receive His gift of salvation through faith. We need to stop trying to save ourselves and fully trust in His sacrifice alone as payment for our sins (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/John/3/John-3-16.html>John 3:16</a>; <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Acts/16/Acts-16-31.html>Acts 16:31</a>). Jesus' sacrifice was sufficient to pay for the sins of all humanity, but His gift of salvation is received through faith alone (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/John/1/John-1-12.html>John 1:12</a>). We must place our trust in Him.</p><iframe allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen frameborder=0 height=315 src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/w3yoyaUj-Sg width=560></iframe><p><strong>Why This Matters</strong><p>Understanding that Jesus saves is crucial because it addresses the core issue of our separation from God due to sin. It offers hope and reconciliation by providing a way for us to be saved from eternal separation from Him. Recognizing Jesus as the Savior allows us to experience forgiveness, redemption, and eternal life.<p><strong>Think About It</strong><p>Consider the significance of Jesus' sacrifice. How does knowing that Jesus willingly paid the price for your sins affect your view of yourself and your relationship with God? How does it impact your understanding of God's love and grace?<p>In conclusion, "Jesus saves" is not just a catchy phrase but a profound truth that holds immense power. Jesus, who is God in human form, came to Earth to save us from the consequences of sin. We are all sinners deserving of judgment, but Jesus' sacrifice on the cross offers us the opportunity to be saved. By placing our faith in Him, we can experience forgiveness and eternal life. Understanding and embracing this truth transforms our lives and deepens our relationship with God.</section><div class=author-info><img alt="Maisha Johnson" class=author-image loading=lazy src=https://biblebasedliving.com/images/profile.png><div class=author-details><h4>Maisha Johnson</h4><p>Written by Maisha Johnson, a dedicated Christian writer known for her inspiring narratives and deep spiritual insights.

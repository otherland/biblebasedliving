The concept of favoritism, as we understand it, often implies unfair treatment towards those who are not favored. However, we must remember that God is always just (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Deuteronomy/32/Deuteronomy-32-4.html>Deuteronomy 32:4</a>; <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/7/Psalm-7-11.html>Psalm 7:11</a>). He loves every human being because they are created in His image (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/John/3/John-3-16.html>John 3:16</a>; <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Lamentations/3/Lamentations-3-22.html>Lamentations 3:22</a>–23; <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/1/Genesis-1-26.html>Genesis 1:26</a>). His judgment is always right. If God favors someone, it is because it is the only right thing to do.<h3>God's Favor and Responsibility</h3><p>When we think of favoritism, we often associate it with a higher status and lesser responsibilities. However, in the case of God's favor, it often comes with added duties and more difficult challenges. Jesus was the embodiment of everything God favors. Throughout Scripture, Jesus is referred to as "My Chosen One" (e.g., <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/42/Isaiah-42-1.html>Isaiah 42:1</a>; <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/3/Matthew-3-17.html>Matthew 3:17</a>; 12:18; <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/9/Luke-9-35.html>Luke 9:35</a>). This title is also used to refer to Israel (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/45/Isaiah-45-4.html>Isaiah 45:4</a>; 65:9; <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/1-Kings/11/1-Kings-11-13.html>1 Kings 11:13</a>). Prophets and kings were chosen by God for His sovereign purposes (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Exodus/33/Exodus-33-17.html>Exodus 33:17</a>; <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Daniel/10/Daniel-10-11.html>Daniel 10:11</a>; <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/1-Samuel/2/1-Samuel-2-26.html>1 Samuel 2:26</a>). For example, God chose Solomon from all of David's sons to become the next king and bestowed him with wealth, popularity, and wisdom (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/1-Chronicles/28/1-Chronicles-28-5.html>1 Chronicles 28:5</a>–6; <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/1-Kings/5/1-Kings-5-12.html>1 Kings 5:12</a>).<p>However, many of those whom God favored were persecuted and faced hardships due to the responsibilities placed upon them. When the angel Gabriel greeted Mary, he said, "Greetings, you who are highly favored! The Lord is with you" (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/1/Luke-1-28.html>Luke 1:28</a>). Although we have no further record of why Mary was chosen, the result of God's favor upon her was that she had to bear great sorrow and difficulty as the mother of the Messiah. In <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/2/Luke-2-35.html>Luke 2:35</a>, it is prophesied that a "sword" would "pierce her soul." Therefore, we can see that God's favor does not necessarily equate to an easy life.<h3>God's Sovereign Right to Choose</h3><p>Is God's favor arbitrary? Does our own choice impact whether we become one of His favorites? In <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/66/Isaiah-66-2.html>Isaiah 66:2</a>, it states, "These are the ones I look on with favor: those who are humble and contrite in spirit, and who tremble at my word." God desires to show favor to everyone, but in His sovereign knowledge, He chooses some for special assignments and blessings. When God instructed Moses about building the tabernacle, He specifically named two men, Bezalel and Oholiab, whom He had chosen for the artistic work (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Exodus/31/Exodus-31-1.html>Exodus 31:1</a>–4, 6). Sometimes, God selects people because He has gifted them in unique ways for special service. As they fulfill the calling He has placed on their lives, they find favor with Him (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Exodus/33/Exodus-33-13.html>Exodus 33:13</a>).</p><iframe allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen frameborder=0 height=315 src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/rAdiWILfSkg width=560></iframe><p>God is not limited in His favor. He does not rank us in order of importance, nor is His favor something we must compete for or earn from one another. Every child of God who comes to Him through faith in Jesus Christ has the favor of God. <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/5/Psalm-5-12.html>Psalm 5:12</a> says, "For you bless the righteous, O Lord; you cover him with favor as with a shield." Our own righteousness does not earn us favor; instead, we are declared righteous through the cleansing of our sins by the blood of Christ (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/5/Romans-5-1.html>Romans 5:1</a>; <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/2-Corinthians/5/2-Corinthians-5-21.html>2 Corinthians 5:21</a>). As we grow in faith and seek to please Him, God demonstrates His favor by drawing near to us (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/James/4/James-4-8.html>James 4:8</a>). He desires to bestow favor upon everyone who seeks Him (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Jeremiah/29/Jeremiah-29-13.html>Jeremiah 29:13</a>). Additionally, God grants spiritual gifts to all His children to use in His service (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/1-Corinthians/12/1-Corinthians-12-5.html>1 Corinthians 12:5</a>–7; <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/1-Peter/4/1-Peter-4-10.html>1 Peter 4:10</a>). Even the Lord's discipline is a means of showing favor to His children. <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/12/Hebrews-12-5.html>Hebrews 12:5</a>–6 states, "My son, do not make light of the Lord's discipline, and do not lose heart when he rebukes you because the Lord disciplines the one he loves, and he chastens everyone he accepts as his son."<h3>God's Favorites</h3><p>God's favorites are His children, purchased through the blood of His Son, Jesus Christ (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/John/1/John-1-12.html>John 1:12</a>). As we honor Jesus, God's favor follows us. This favor may manifest itself through greater responsibility, blessing, or even suffering for His sake (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Acts/5/Acts-5-41.html>Acts 5:41</a>). The reward of God's favor is His promise that "all things work together for the good to those who love God and are called according to His purpose" (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/8/Romans-8-28.html>Romans 8:28</a>). When we are God's favorites, we know that He is always with us and will reward us for everything done for Him (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/28/Matthew-28-20.html>Matthew 28:20</a>; <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Revelation/22/Revelation-22-12.html>Revelation 22:12</a>).<h4>Why This Matters</h4><p>Understanding whether or not God has favorites matters because it affects our perception of God's character and how we relate to Him. When we know that God's favor is available to all who seek Him, it encourages us to draw near to Him and grow in our relationship. Recognizing that being favored by God does not mean an easy life but instead entails fulfilling our unique calling helps us embrace our responsibilities with humility and gratitude.<h4>Think About It</h4><ul><li>Have you ever felt like God's favorite or least favorite? Reflect on how these feelings may align or differ from the biblical understanding of God's favor.<li>Consider the responsibilities and challenges that come with being favored by God. How does this perspective change your perception of what it means to be God's favorite?<li>In what ways can you seek to grow in your relationship with God and honor Jesus as His child? How might this impact your experience of God's favor in your life?</ul></section><div class=author-info><img alt="Maisha Johnson" class=author-image loading=lazy src=https://biblebasedliving.com/images/profile.png><div class=author-details><h4>Maisha Johnson</h4><p>Written by Maisha Johnson, a dedicated Christian writer known for her inspiring narratives and deep spiritual insights.

href=https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/12/Matthew-12-46.html>Matthew 12:46</a>, <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/8/Luke-8-19.html>Luke 8:19</a>, <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/3/Mark-3-31.html>Mark 3:31</a>), indicating that they came to see Him along with His mother. According to <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/13/Matthew-13-55.html>Matthew 13:55</a>, Jesus had four brothers named James, Joseph, Simon, and Judas. The Bible also mentions His sisters but does not provide their names or numbers (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/13/Matthew-13-56.html>Matthew 13:56</a>). In <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/John/7/John-7-1.html>John 7:1-10</a>, His brothers are described as going to a festival while Jesus stays behind. Additionally, <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Acts/1/Acts-1-14.html>Acts 1:14</a> tells us that His mother and brothers were praying with the disciples. <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Galatians/1/Galatians-1-19.html>Galatians 1:19</a> specifically mentions James as Jesus' brother. From these passages, it is reasonable to conclude that Jesus had actual blood half-siblings.<p>Some Roman Catholics argue that these "brothers" were actually Jesus' cousins. However, the Greek word used for "brother" in each instance has the normal and literal meaning of a physical brother. While the word can refer to other relatives, its primary meaning is a sibling relationship. If they were Jesus' cousins, there would be no reason for them to be frequently described as being with Mary, Jesus' mother. Therefore, it is clear from the context that they were His blood-related half-brothers.</p><iframe allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen frameborder=0 height=315 src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/bMng55EULjI width=560></iframe><p>Another argument put forth by Roman Catholics is that Jesus' brothers and sisters were the children of Joseph from a previous marriage. However, there is no biblical basis for this theory. The Bible does not suggest that Joseph was married or had children before he married Mary. If Joseph had multiple children before marrying Mary, it raises questions as to why they are not mentioned during important events such as their trip to Bethlehem or their travels to Egypt and back to Nazareth.<p>There is no biblical reason to believe that these siblings are anything other than the actual children of Joseph and Mary. Those who oppose the idea of Jesus having half-brothers and half-sisters do so based on a preconceived notion of the perpetual virginity of Mary, which is not supported by Scripture. <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/1/Matthew-1-25.html>Matthew 1:25</a> clearly states that Joseph had no union with Mary until after she gave birth to Jesus. Therefore, it is evident that Jesus had half-siblings, half-brothers, and half-sisters who were the children of Joseph and Mary. This is the clear teaching of God's Word.<h3>Why This Matters</h3><p>Understanding the relationship between Jesus and His siblings has implications for our understanding of the dynamics within Jesus' family and His role as the Messiah. It helps us gain insight into His earthly life and the challenges He may have faced within His own family.<h3>Think About It</h3><ol><li>How does recognizing Jesus' brothers and sisters as His blood-related relatives affect your understanding of His earthly family?<li>What impact do you think having half-siblings had on Jesus' ministry and his relationship with His immediate family?<li>How does this biblical teaching challenge or affirm your beliefs about Mary's perpetual virginity?</ol></section><div class=author-info><img alt="Maisha Johnson" class=author-image loading=lazy src=https://biblebasedliving.com/images/profile.png><div class=author-details><h4>Maisha Johnson</h4><p>Written by Maisha Johnson, a dedicated Christian writer known for her inspiring narratives and deep spiritual insights.

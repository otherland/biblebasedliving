According to the Bible and ancient Christian creeds, Jesus is not a created being but rather the eternal Son of God. Let's explore this concept in more detail.<h3>The Eternal Son</h3><p>The Bible teaches that Jesus is the eternal Son of God. He has always existed and there was never a time when He did not exist. This is supported by passages such as <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/John/1/John-1-1.html>John 1:1</a>–3, which states, "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was in the beginning with God. All things were made through him, and without him was not any thing made that was made." The "Word" in this verse refers to the Son of God before He took on human flesh and came to earth.<h3>The Nature of Jesus</h3><p>Before Jesus came to earth, He already existed in the form of God as a member of the triune Godhead. <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Colossians/2/Colossians-2-9.html>Colossians 2:9</a> affirms this, stating, "In Christ all the fullness of the Deity lives in bodily form." Jesus is fully God and has always been so. Therefore, He was not created because God Himself was not created.<h3>The Incarnation</h3><iframe allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen frameborder=0 height=315 src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/j0Z9kOi5Y2U width=560></iframe><p>When Jesus came to earth, He took on human nature and a human body. This event is known as the Incarnation. <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Philippians/2/Philippians-2-6.html>Philippians 2:6</a>–8 describes what took place when Jesus came to earth: "Being in very nature God, [He] did not consider equality with God something to be used to His own advantage; rather, He made Himself nothing by taking the very nature of a servant, being made in human likeness. And being found in appearance as a man, He humbled Himself by becoming obedient to death—even death on a cross!"<p>During the Incarnation, the eternal Son of God took on human flesh but did not cease to be God. His divine nature remained intact while He humbled Himself and became fully human. Jesus' body was "prepared" for Him in order to offer the perfect sacrifice for sin (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/10/Hebrews-10-5.html>Hebrews 10:5</a>). The Holy Spirit overshadowed a virgin, and she conceived. This miraculous event is described in <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/1/Luke-1-26.html>Luke 1:26</a>–38.<h3>Fully God and Fully Man</h3><p>Jesus' dual nature as fully God and fully man is a crucial aspect of Christian belief. He had to be fully human in order to bear the penalty for our sins (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/2-Corinthians/5/2-Corinthians-5-21.html>2 Corinthians 5:21</a>). Jesus lived a sinless life, completely in harmony with His heavenly Father and in dependence upon the Holy Spirit. No created being could have borne the weight of the world's sins.<p>The sacrificial animals used before Christ were mere symbols of the ultimate sacrifice that Jesus would make as the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/John/1/John-1-29.html>John 1:29</a>). Only God Himself could meet the requirements for an acceptable substitute, and Jesus is God. Through faith in Him, we are guaranteed eternal life.<h3>Why This Matters</h3><p>Understanding that Jesus is not a created being but the eternal Son of God has significant implications for our faith. It reinforces the divinity and authority of Jesus as our Savior and Lord. It also highlights the incredible love and humility that Jesus demonstrated by willingly taking on human flesh and sacrificing Himself for our sins.<h3>Think About It</h3><p>Reflecting on the eternal nature of Jesus can deepen our appreciation for His sacrifice and help us trust Him more fully. Consider how knowing that Jesus is both fully God and fully man impacts your understanding of His work on the cross. How does this knowledge shape your relationship with Him?</section><div class=author-info><img alt="Maisha Johnson" class=author-image loading=lazy src=https://biblebasedliving.com/images/profile.png><div class=author-details><h4>Maisha Johnson</h4><p>Written by Maisha Johnson, a dedicated Christian writer known for her inspiring narratives and deep spiritual insights.

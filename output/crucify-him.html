brought before the Roman governor, Pontius Pilate, Pilate could not find any fault in Him. He said so three times during the trial. Pilate sought a way to release Jesus, but instead, he offered the crowd a choice between Jesus and a convicted criminal named Barabbas, hoping they would choose Jesus. However, to Pilate's surprise, the crowd chose Barabbas for release. When Pilate asked what should be done with Jesus, the crowd cried out, "Crucify Him!"<p>The religious and political leaders of that time hated and opposed Jesus because His teachings had alienated and angered them. He had exposed their hypocrisy on numerous occasions and claimed to be God, which was considered blasphemy by the unbelieving teachers of the law. The religious leaders wanted to utterly destroy Jesus, and only His death would satisfy them.<p>Crucifixion was reserved for the worst of criminals during that time. It was a torturous method of execution that would last for hours. The religious leaders who despised Jesus likely saw crucifixion as a fitting punishment for Him. They arrested and tried Jesus in secret to hide their move against Him from His many supporters. When Jesus was brought before Pilate, it was still early in the morning. The chief priests whipped the crowd into a frenzy, encouraging them to call for Barabbas's release. Influenced by the chief priests, the crowd shouted, "Crucify Him!" Pilate, eager to please the people, gave in to their demands and had Jesus flogged and then turned over for crucifixion.<p>The events leading up to Jesus' crucifixion were puzzling. Just days earlier, there was a crowd in Jerusalem celebrating Jesus as the Messiah during His triumphal entry into the city. However, on Friday, there was a different crowd crying out for His crucifixion. The change of heart in the city is difficult to understand. Some people may have been part of both crowds, having become disillusioned with Jesus when they realized He was not going to establish His kingdom immediately or because they disliked His call for repentance. It is also possible that the crowd gathered before Pilate had been assembled and influenced by the Jewish leaders.</p><iframe allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen frameborder=0 height=315 src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/06GaBm-Kd6I width=560></iframe><p>Ultimately, it was not the crowd's cries of "Crucify Him!" that put Jesus on the cross. It was our sin. From the beginning, God had promised to send a Savior who would conquer sin and death. Jesus Christ, God's own Son, became the perfect God-man to take upon Himself the punishment for our sins. Although wicked men played a role in Jesus' death, His sacrifice was ultimately the will of God. The shedding of Jesus' blood fulfilled God's promise to provide a Savior and established the New Covenant. Jesus conquered death by rising again three days later and ascending to His Father's right hand in heaven.<p><strong>Why This Matters</strong><p>Understanding the events leading up to Jesus' crucifixion is crucial for Christians because it reveals the depth of God's love and His plan for salvation. Despite being innocent, Jesus willingly endured the cross for our sake. His sacrifice provides forgiveness and redemption for all who believe in Him. By recognizing our sinfulness and accepting Jesus as our Savior, we can experience the freedom and eternal life that He offers.<p><strong>Think About It</strong><ol><li>Reflect on the religious and political leaders' hatred for Jesus during His time on earth. How does this highlight the opposition that often arises when one stands for truth and righteousness?<li>Consider the crowd's change of heart from celebrating Jesus as the Messiah to demanding His crucifixion. How does this remind us of the fickle nature of human emotions and the importance of placing our faith in Christ alone?<li>Contemplate the significance of Jesus' sacrifice on the cross. How does His death demonstrate God's love for humanity and provide a way for us to be reconciled with Him?</ol></section><div class=author-info><img alt="Maisha Johnson" class=author-image loading=lazy src=https://biblebasedliving.com/images/profile.png><div class=author-details><h4>Maisha Johnson</h4><p>Written by Maisha Johnson, a dedicated Christian writer known for her inspiring narratives and deep spiritual insights.

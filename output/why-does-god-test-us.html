Many believers have wondered why God tests us or allows us to be tested. In order to understand this, we must first acknowledge that testing does indeed come from Him. When God tests His children, He is doing something valuable and purposeful.<h3>The Purpose of Testing</h3><p>The biblical accounts provide us with insight into the purpose of testing. For example, King David sought God's testing, asking Him to examine his heart and mind to ensure they were true to Him (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/26/Psalm-26-2.html>Psalm 26:2</a>; 139:23). Additionally, Abram was tested by God when he was asked to sacrifice his son Isaac. Abram obediently followed God's command and demonstrated to the world that he is the father of faith (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/11/Hebrews-11-17.html>Hebrews 11:17</a>–19; <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/4/Romans-4-16.html>Romans 4:16</a>).<p>Throughout the Old and New Testaments, the word "test" means "to prove by trial." Therefore, when God tests His children, His purpose is to prove that our faith is real. It is not that God needs to prove it to Himself since He knows all things, but rather He is proving it to us. Through testing, God assures us that our faith is genuine, that we are truly His children, and that no trial will overcome our faith.<h3>The Benefits of Testing</h3><p>In the Parable of the Sower, Jesus identifies those who fall away as individuals who receive the seed of God's Word with joy but stumble when faced with testing. James also emphasizes that testing develops perseverance, which leads to maturity in our walk with God (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/James/1/James-1-3.html>James 1:3</a>–4). Furthermore, James refers to testing as a blessing because it ultimately leads to receiving the crown of life promised by God to those who love Him (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/James/1/James-1-12.html>James 1:12</a>).<p>Testing comes from our heavenly Father who works all things together for the good of those who love Him and are called to be His children (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/8/Romans-8-28.html>Romans 8:28</a>). Therefore, even though testing may be challenging and uncomfortable, it serves a greater purpose in our spiritual growth and completeness.<h3>The Nature of Testing</h3><p>Testing or trials can manifest in various ways. Accepting Christ often requires us to step out of our comfort zones and embrace the unknown. Persevering through testing results in spiritual maturity and completeness. This is why James encourages believers to consider it pure joy when facing trials of many kinds (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/James/1/James-1-2.html>James 1:2</a>).<p>The testing of faith can come in different forms, ranging from daily irritations and small challenges to severe afflictions (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/48/Isaiah-48-10.html>Isaiah 48:10</a>) and attacks from Satan (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Job/2/Job-2-7.html>Job 2:7</a>). Regardless of the source, undergoing trials allows us to benefit from God's refining process.</p><iframe allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen frameborder=0 height=315 src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/2EibSQdq-mw width=560></iframe><h3>God's Sovereign Control</h3><p>The account of Job provides a perfect example of how God allows one of His faithful servants to be tested by the devil. Job endured his trials patiently and did not blame God for his suffering (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Job/1/Job-1-22.html>Job 1:22</a>). However, Job's story also reveals that Satan's ability to test us is limited by God's sovereign control. No demonic force can test or afflict us beyond what God has ordained. All our trials work toward God's perfect purpose and our ultimate benefit.<h3>Positive Results of Testing</h3><p>The Bible offers numerous examples that showcase the positive outcomes of being tested. The psalmist compares our testing to the refining process of silver (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/66/Psalm-66-10.html>Psalm 66:10</a>). Peter also emphasizes the worth of our faith compared to gold and explains that we suffer grief in various trials to refine our faith (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/1-Peter/1/1-Peter-1-6.html>1 Peter 1:6</a>–7). Through testing, God enables us to grow into strong disciples who live by faith rather than relying solely on what we see (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/2-Corinthians/5/2-Corinthians-5-7.html>2 Corinthians 5:7</a>).<h3>Trusting God in Testing</h3><p>When we experience the storms of life, it is crucial that we respond by digging our roots more deeply into God's Word. Just as a tree digs its roots deeper for a stronger grip in the earth during a storm, we must anchor ourselves in God's promises and cling to His truth. By doing so, we can weather any storm that comes against us.<h3>Why This Matters</h3><p>Understanding why God tests us is essential for believers. It helps us maintain a proper perspective when faced with trials and challenges. Recognizing that testing is a means of proving our faith strengthens our resolve to persevere and grow in our walk with God. Embracing the purpose of testing allows us to trust in God's sovereignty and His ability to work all things together for our good.<h3>Think About It</h3><ol><li>How does knowing that testing proves the authenticity of our faith affect your perspective on trials and challenges?<li>Reflect on past experiences of testing in your life. How did those trials contribute to your spiritual growth?<li>In what ways can you deepen your roots in God's Word during times of testing?</ol></section><div class=author-info><img alt="Maisha Johnson" class=author-image loading=lazy src=https://biblebasedliving.com/images/profile.png><div class=author-details><h4>Maisha Johnson</h4><p>Written by Maisha Johnson, a dedicated Christian writer known for her inspiring narratives and deep spiritual insights.

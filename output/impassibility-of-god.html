God is capable of feeling or suffering. Some argue that God is impassible, meaning He exists above human emotion and remains untouched by it. Others believe that God is passible, meaning He can and does experience emotional pain.<h3>The Attributes of God</h3><p>The impassibility of God is often seen as one of His essential attributes. It is considered alongside other attributes such as His immutability (unchanging nature), omniscience (all-knowing), and eternality. Those who argue for impassibility view God as apathetic, in the sense that He does not experience or respond emotionally to the events on earth. On the other hand, those who argue for passibility insist that God does suffer with us and feel emotional pain.<h3>Avoiding Extremes</h3><p>Both sides of the debate must be careful not to push their arguments to the extreme. When the doctrine of divine impassibility is taken to an extreme, it can result in deism, which portrays God as distant and uninvolved with humanity. Conversely, when the doctrine of divine passibility is taken to an extreme, it can lead to open theism, which suggests that God does not know the future and is surprised by events.</p><iframe allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen frameborder=0 height=315 src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/AkbKyfjnvm0 width=560></iframe><h3>Arguments for Impassibility</h3><p>Supporters of divine impassibility often base their argument on the concept of God's immutability. They reason that if God suffers in response to pain, then He has changed. They do not deny that God has emotions but assert that His emotions are voluntary and purposeful rather than knee-jerk reactions to earthly events. Additionally, proponents of divine impassibility argue that God's absolute power and sovereignty make it unlikely for Him to suffer since suffering implies being subject to something.<h3>Arguments for Passibility</h3><p>Advocates for divine passibility point to numerous Scripture passages that suggest God does respond emotionally to events on earth. Throughout the Bible, we see God's compassion for His people, His wrath against sin, and His pain in response to rejection. Jesus, who is described as the exact representation of God's being, wept at Lazarus's tomb. He is also portrayed as our Great High Priest who can empathize with our weaknesses. The suffering of Jesus, predicted by the prophets, further supports the concept of God's passibility.<h3>Sharing in Suffering</h3><p>The idea of passibility is closely related to the concept of believers entering into the suffering of others. Scripture encourages Christians to remember and empathize with those who are suffering, just as Jesus did. By sharing in each other's sorrow, believers reflect the passibility of God.<h3>God's Involvement and Care</h3><p>Supporters of passibility emphasize that God's eternal divine sympathy drives Him to be involved in His creation and willingly allows His heart to be touched by the suffering of His people. While God is transcendent, He is not aloof. The Bible portrays Him as a passionate God who listens to our cries for help, shows compassion, and understands our suffering firsthand.<h3>Why This Matters</h3><p>Understanding the impassibility or passibility of God has implications for how we perceive and relate to Him. If God is impassible, we may view Him as distant and unfeeling, leading to a sense of abandonment or isolation during times of struggle. On the other hand, if God is passible, we can find comfort in knowing that He empathizes with our pain and actively participates in our lives.<h3>Think About It</h3><p>Consider how your understanding of God's nature affects your relationship with Him. Do you view Him as distant and uninvolved? Or do you believe that He cares deeply about your struggles and emotions? Reflect on how embracing the concept of God's passibility can deepen your connection with Him and encourage you to share in the suffering of others.</section><div class=author-info><img alt="Maisha Johnson" class=author-image loading=lazy src=https://biblebasedliving.com/images/profile.png><div class=author-details><h4>Maisha Johnson</h4><p>Written by Maisha Johnson, a dedicated Christian writer known for her inspiring narratives and deep spiritual insights.

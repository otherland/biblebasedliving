Let's explore these points in more detail.<h3>Creation Points to a Creator</h3><p>The existence of God can be seen in the world around us. The Bible tells us that "since the creation of the world God’s invisible qualities—his eternal power and divine nature—have been clearly seen, being understood from what has been made, so that people are without excuse" (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/1/Romans-1-20.html>Romans 1:20</a>). When we look at the intricacies and design of the universe, we see evidence of a Great Designer.<p>For example, if we found a wristwatch in a field, we wouldn't assume it appeared out of nowhere or had always existed. We would recognize that its design points to a designer. Similarly, the complexity and precision we observe in the natural world argue for an Intelligent Designer. Our measurement of time, for instance, is based on the regular rotation of the earth. The universe's design suggests that there is a purpose behind it all.<h3>DNA: Evidence of Intelligent Design</h3><p>Another example of design can be found in our own bodies. The DNA in every cell contains an intricate "code" that governs our physical characteristics and functions. The complexity and purpose of this code argue for an Intelligent Writer behind it. If we discovered an encoded message, we would assume there was an intelligent sender who created the code. In the same way, DNA points to an Intelligent Creator who designed life itself.<h3>Innate Sense of Eternity</h3><p>Humans have an innate sense that there is more to life than meets the eye. <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Ecclesiastes/3/Ecclesiastes-3-11.html>Ecclesiastes 3:11</a> tells us that God has put eternity in our hearts. This sense of eternity manifests itself in two ways: law-making and worship.<p>Throughout history, all civilizations have valued certain moral laws, such as love being esteemed and lying being condemned. This universal morality points to a Supreme Moral Being who gave us these scruples. Additionally, people all over the world, regardless of culture, have always felt a need to worship something or someone higher than themselves. Our propensity to worship aligns with the fact that we were created "in [God's] own image" (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/1/Genesis-1-27.html>Genesis 1:27</a>).<h3>God's Revelation Through His Word</h3><iframe allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen frameborder=0 height=315 src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/_ie9musGEqQ width=560></iframe><p>God has also revealed Himself through His Word, the Bible. Throughout Scripture, the existence of God is treated as a self-evident fact. Just as Benjamin Franklin didn't need to prove his own existence in his autobiography, God doesn't spend much time proving His existence in His book. Instead, the Bible focuses on the life-changing nature of its message, its integrity, and the miracles that accompanied its writing.<h3>Jesus Christ: God Incarnate</h3><p>The ultimate revelation of God came through His Son, Jesus Christ. In <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/John/1/John-1-1.html>John 1:1</a> and 14, we read that "the Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us." Jesus lived a perfect life, fulfilling the prophecies concerning the Messiah. He performed numerous acts of compassion and public miracles to authenticate His message and bear witness to His deity. One of the most significant events was His resurrection from the dead, witnessed by hundreds of people.<p>The historical record supports these extraordinary events surrounding Jesus' life. As the Apostle Paul said, this wasn't done in secret but in full view of many witnesses. The life, death, and resurrection of Jesus provide substantial evidence for the reality of God.<h3>Why This Matters</h3><p>Understanding that God is real has profound implications for our lives. It means that we are not alone in this world and that there is purpose and meaning to our existence. Recognizing God's existence helps us make sense of our innate sense of right and wrong and our longing for something greater than ourselves. It also offers hope, knowing that God has revealed Himself to us and invites us into a relationship with Him.<h3>Think About It</h3><p>Consider the evidence of God's existence in creation. Look at the intricate design of the world around you and ponder how it points to an Intelligent Designer. Reflect on your own sense of eternity and how it aligns with the idea that we were created in God's image. Take time to study the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ and consider the impact these events have had throughout history.</section><div class=author-info><img alt="Maisha Johnson" class=author-image loading=lazy src=https://biblebasedliving.com/images/profile.png><div class=author-details><h4>Maisha Johnson</h4><p>Written by Maisha Johnson, a dedicated Christian writer known for her inspiring narratives and deep spiritual insights.

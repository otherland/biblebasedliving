"anointed one" or "chosen one." In Greek, the equivalent word is <em>christos</em>, which in English is translated as "Christ." Essentially, the name "Jesus Christ" can be understood as "Jesus the Messiah." In biblical times, anointing someone with oil was a symbolic act that signified God's consecration or setting apart of that person for a specific role. So, an "anointed one" was someone chosen by God for a special purpose.<p>In the Old Testament, individuals were anointed for various positions such as prophet, priest, and king. For example, God instructed Elijah to anoint Elisha as his successor (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/1-Kings/19/1-Kings-19-16.html>1 Kings 19:16</a>). Aaron was anointed as Israel's first high priest (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Leviticus/8/Leviticus-8-12.html>Leviticus 8:12</a>). Samuel anointed both Saul and David as kings of Israel (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/1-Samuel/10/1-Samuel-10-1.html>1 Samuel 10:1</a>; 16:13). These men held positions that were considered "anointed."<p>However, the Old Testament also prophesied the coming of a Deliverer who would be chosen by God to redeem Israel (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/42/Isaiah-42-1.html>Isaiah 42:1</a>; 61:1–3). This Deliverer was referred to as the Messiah by the Jews.<p>Jesus of Nazareth is identified as the prophesied Messiah in the New Testament (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/4/Luke-4-17.html>Luke 4:17</a>–21; <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/John/4/John-4-25.html>John 4:25</a>–26). The Bible provides evidence that Jesus is indeed the Chosen One. For instance, the apostle John wrote, "These [miracles] are written that you may believe that Jesus is the Messiah, the Son of God, and that by believing you may have life in his name" (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/John/20/John-20-31.html>John 20:31</a>). Additionally, Peter testified that Jesus is "the Messiah, the Son of the living God" (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/16/Matthew-16-16.html>Matthew 16:16</a>). The ultimate proof of Jesus' identity as the Messiah is His resurrection from the dead. <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Acts/10/Acts-10-39.html>Acts 10:39</a>–43 provides eyewitness testimony to His resurrection and declares that "he is the one whom God appointed as judge of the living and the dead."</p><iframe allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen frameborder=0 height=315 src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/A6-wlevyAIs width=560></iframe><p>Jesus fulfills the roles of Prophet, Priest, and King, which further confirms His identity as the Messiah. He is a prophet because He embodies and proclaims the Word of God (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/John/1/John-1-1.html>John 1:1</a>–18; 14:24; <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/24/Luke-24-19.html>Luke 24:19</a>). He is a priest because His death atones for our sins and reconciles us to the Father (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/2/Hebrews-2-17.html>Hebrews 2:17</a>; 4:14). And He is a king because, after His resurrection, God bestowed all authority on Him (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/John/18/John-18-36.html>John 18:36</a>; <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Ephesians/1/Ephesians-1-20.html>Ephesians 1:20</a>–23; <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Revelation/19/Revelation-19-16.html>Revelation 19:16</a>).<p>It's important to note that the Jews of Jesus' day had certain expectations about the Messiah. They anticipated that He would redeem Israel by overthrowing Roman rule and establishing an earthly kingdom (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Acts/1/Acts-1-6.html>Acts 1:6</a>). However, it was only after Jesus' resurrection that His disciples began to understand the true meaning of the prophecies in the Old Testament regarding the Messiah's mission (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/24/Luke-24-25.html>Luke 24:25</a>–27). The Messiah's primary purpose was to deliver His people from sin (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/John/8/John-8-31.html>John 8:31</a>–36). This salvation was accomplished through Jesus' death and resurrection (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/John/12/John-12-32.html>John 12:32</a>; <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/John/3/John-3-16.html>John 3:16</a>). In the future, Jesus the Messiah will also deliver His people from their physical enemies when He establishes His Kingdom on earth (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/9/Isaiah-9-1.html>Isaiah 9:1</a>–7).<h3>Why This Matters</h3><p>Understanding the meaning of "Messiah" is significant for Christians because it reveals Jesus' identity as the Chosen One who fulfilled Old Testament prophecies. Recognizing Jesus as the Messiah is crucial for our faith because it affirms His unique role in our salvation. By believing in Him, we can have eternal life in His name (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/John/20/John-20-31.html>John 20:31</a>). The Messiah's anointed positions as Prophet, Priest, and King point to the comprehensive work He accomplished on our behalf. Jesus' role as Prophet reveals that He is the embodiment of God's Word and the ultimate revealer of truth. As our High Priest, Jesus offered Himself as a sacrifice for our sins, making reconciliation with God possible. And as King, He has been given all authority and will establish His Kingdom on earth.<h3>Think About It</h3><p>Consider the significance of Jesus being the anointed Messiah. How does His fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies strengthen your faith? In what ways does understanding Jesus' roles as Prophet, Priest, and King impact your view of Him? Reflect on the future reign of Jesus as the Messiah and how it brings hope and assurance to your life.</section><div class=author-info><img alt="Maisha Johnson" class=author-image loading=lazy src=https://biblebasedliving.com/images/profile.png><div class=author-details><h4>Maisha Johnson</h4><p>Written by Maisha Johnson, a dedicated Christian writer known for her inspiring narratives and deep spiritual insights.

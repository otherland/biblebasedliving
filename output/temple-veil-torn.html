religious life of Jews during the time of Jesus. It was the center for animal sacrifices and the practice of faithful worship according to the Law of Moses. Within the temple, there was a veil that separated the Holy of Holies, where God's presence resided, from the rest of the temple where people dwelt. This veil symbolized the separation between man and God due to sin. Only the high priest was allowed to enter beyond this veil once a year to make atonement for the sins of Israel.<h3>The Size and Significance of the Veil</h3><p>The veil in the temple was an impressive structure, measuring around 60 feet high. While early Jewish tradition suggests that it was about four inches thick, the Bible does not provide an exact confirmation of this measurement. The veil was made from blue, purple, and scarlet material, as well as fine twisted linen, according to the book of Exodus.<p>The size and thickness of the veil make the events surrounding Jesus' death all the more significant. At the moment Jesus gave up His spirit on the cross, something remarkable occurred: "the curtain of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom" (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/27/Matthew-27-50.html>Matthew 27:50</a>-51a). This tearing of the veil held deep symbolic meaning.<h3>The Significance of the Torn Veil</h3><p>The tearing of the veil at Jesus' death symbolized that His sacrifice—the shedding of His own blood—was sufficient for atoning for sins. It signified that now, access to the Holy of Holies was open to all people for all time, both Jews and Gentiles. The tearing of the veil represented a profound shift in how humanity could approach God.<p>Previously, only the high priest could enter beyond the veil into God's presence. But with Jesus' death and the tearing of the veil, a new way opened up. <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/10/Hebrews-10-19.html>Hebrews 10:19-20</a> explains, "We have confidence to enter the Most Holy Place by the blood of Jesus by a new and living way opened for us through the curtain, that is, his body." Through Jesus, we now have direct access to God.<h3>The Veil and Christ's Role</h3><p>The veil in the temple represented Christ Himself as the only way to the Father. Just as the high priest had to pass through the veil to enter the Holy of Holies, now, through Jesus, we can enter into God's presence. Jesus is our superior High Priest, and as believers in His finished work, we partake in His better priesthood.</p><iframe allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen frameborder=0 height=315 src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/_OsJoVZIILs width=560></iframe><p>The tearing of the veil also holds broader significance. In Hebrews, it is explained that the temple and its religious system were shadows of things to come, ultimately pointing to Jesus Christ. His death removed the barriers between God and humanity. The constant reminder of sin's separation from God that the veil represented was no longer necessary because Jesus had made a way for us to approach God freely.<h3>Why This Matters</h3><p>Understanding the torn temple veil holds immense importance for Christians today. It signifies that salvation and access to God are available to all who believe in Jesus' sacrifice. It emphasizes that no longer do we need an intermediary like a high priest or a physical temple to approach God. Instead, we can have a personal relationship with Him through faith in Jesus Christ.<p>The torn veil also highlights the significance of Jesus' role as our High Priest and Savior. It underscores His unique position as the only way to God and encourages us to place our trust in Him alone for salvation.<h3>Think About It</h3><p>Reflecting on the torn temple veil prompts us to consider several important points:<ol><li><p>The seriousness of sin: The separation symbolized by the veil reminds us of the devastating effects of sin and our need for redemption.</p><li><p>The sufficiency of Christ's sacrifice: The tearing of the veil declares that Jesus' sacrifice on the cross was enough to atone for our sins and provide access to God.</p><li><p>Our access to God: Through faith in Jesus, we now have direct access to God's presence. We can approach Him with confidence and boldness, knowing that Jesus has made a way for us.</p><li><p>The end of the Old Covenant: The tearing of the veil signifies the passing away of the old covenant and the establishment of the new covenant through Jesus Christ.</p><li><p>The centrality of Jesus: Just as the veil represented Christ, we are reminded that He is central to our faith and the only means by which we can approach and know God.</p></ol><p>In conclusion, the tearing of the temple veil at the moment of Jesus' death holds immense significance for believers. It signifies that through His sacrifice, we have access to God and are no longer separated from Him by sin. The torn veil symbolizes a new way—a personal relationship with God through Jesus Christ. It calls us to reflect on sin, trust in Christ's sacrifice, and embrace the privilege of direct access to God.</section><div class=author-info><img alt="Maisha Johnson" class=author-image loading=lazy src=https://biblebasedliving.com/images/profile.png><div class=author-details><h4>Maisha Johnson</h4><p>Written by Maisha Johnson, a dedicated Christian writer known for her inspiring narratives and deep spiritual insights.

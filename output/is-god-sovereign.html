discussing the concept of free will, we often focus on matters of salvation. The question that troubles many is who exactly has control over our eternal destiny. To understand the issue of free will, it is important to first grasp the nature of mankind, as our will is bound by that nature.<p>Man's will is like that of a prisoner who has the freedom to pace up and down in his cell but is constrained by the walls and cannot go any farther. Similarly, due to sin, humanity is imprisoned within a cell of corruption and wickedness that permeates to the very core of our being. Every part of us, including our bodies, minds, and wills, is in bondage to sin. The book of Jeremiah describes the state of man's heart as "deceitful and desperately wicked" (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Jeremiah/17/Jeremiah-17-9.html>Jeremiah 17:9</a>). In our natural, unregenerate state, we are focused on worldly desires rather than spiritual matters. <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/8/Romans-8-6.html>Romans 8:6-7</a> explains that being carnally minded leads to death, while being spiritually minded brings life and peace. The carnal mind is in enmity against God and does not submit to His law, nor can it do so. These verses make it clear that prior to salvation, man is incapable of choosing what is good and holy because his will is not free; it is constrained by his sinful nature.<p>The question then arises: how can anyone be saved? <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Ephesians/2/Ephesians-2-1.html>Ephesians 2:1</a> describes the process. We who are "dead in our trespasses and sins" have been made alive through Christ. Just as a dead man cannot bring himself back to life because he lacks the power to do so, we are spiritually dead and unable to rise on our own. However, Jesus Christ came and commanded us to come to life (John 11). While we were still sinners, Christ died for us (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/5/Romans-5-8.html>Romans 5:8</a>). He calls us out of our spiritual graves and gives us a completely new nature, one that is undefiled by sin. This transformation is made possible by God's grace, which we receive through the gift of faith in Jesus. Both His grace and our faith are freely given to us. Our salvation is a free gift bestowed upon those whom God has chosen before the foundation of the world (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Ephesians/1/Ephesians-1-4.html>Ephesians 1:4</a>). God chose this method of salvation to bring glory to Himself, not to mankind. Our response is to praise Him for the glory of His grace. If we were able to choose our own salvation, we would receive the glory that rightfully belongs to God alone (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/48/Isaiah-48-11.html>Isaiah 48:11</a>).<p>The question naturally arises: how do we know who has been saved "from the foundation of the world"? The truth is, we don't. That is why it is crucial for us to spread the good news of salvation through Jesus Christ to all corners of the earth. We are called to plead with others to be reconciled to God before it is too late (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/2-Corinthians/5/2-Corinthians-5-20.html>2 Corinthians 5:20</a>). We cannot know whom God will choose to release from their prison cells of sin. That choice is left to Him, so we present the gospel message to everyone. Those who come to Jesus will never be cast out (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/John/6/John-6-37.html>John 6:37</a>).<h3>Why This Matters</h3><iframe allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen frameborder=0 height=315 src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/RwuzitntNFg width=560></iframe><p>Understanding the issue of free will and God's sovereignty is vital because it shapes our understanding of salvation and our relationship with God. Recognizing that our natural state is one of bondage to sin helps us grasp the desperate need for a Savior. It also allows us to appreciate the amazing grace of God, who chooses to save us despite our inherent inability to choose Him on our own.<p>Realizing that salvation is entirely a work of God's grace helps us humbly acknowledge that salvation is not based on our own efforts or merits. We cannot earn our way into heaven through good works or righteous acts. Salvation is a free gift that God, in His sovereign love and mercy, bestows upon those whom He has chosen.<h3>Think About It</h3><ol><li>How does the concept of God's sovereignty affect your understanding of salvation?<li>Reflect on the fact that we are spiritually dead and incapable of saving ourselves. How does this impact your perception of your own abilities and accomplishments?<li>Consider the role of God's grace in your life. How does recognizing it as a free gift change your perspective on salvation?</ol></section><div class=author-info><img alt="Maisha Johnson" class=author-image loading=lazy src=https://biblebasedliving.com/images/profile.png><div class=author-details><h4>Maisha Johnson</h4><p>Written by Maisha Johnson, a dedicated Christian writer known for her inspiring narratives and deep spiritual insights.

prophecy</strong> is a special ability given by the Holy Spirit to some believers to speak forth the message of God. It involves receiving and communicating a divinely inspired message that reveals God's heart, will, or plans to individuals or a group of people. Those with this gift are able to speak words of encouragement, edification, exhortation, and comfort to others, bringing insight and direction from God.<p>In <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/1-Corinthians/14/1-Corinthians-14-3.html>1 Corinthians 14:3</a>, the Bible says, "But the one who prophesies speaks to people for their strengthening, encouraging and comfort." This verse highlights the purpose of the gift of prophecy, which is to build up the body of Christ and bring God's guidance and encouragement to His people. Prophecy is not about predicting the future, but rather about speaking God's truth in love to uplift and bless others.<ul><li>The spiritual gift of prophecy is not limited to speaking in church settings or during worship services. It can manifest in various ways, such as through personal conversations, written messages, or even artistic expressions that convey God's message.<li>Those with the gift of prophecy should always test and discern the messages they receive to ensure they align with the teachings of the Bible and the character of God. This helps prevent the spread of false or misleading prophecies that can harm individuals or the church community.<li>The gift of prophecy is meant to be used in conjunction with other spiritual gifts, such as discernment, wisdom, and faith, to bring about the fullness of God's purpose and plan for His people. It should always be exercised with humility, love, and a desire to build up and unify the body of Christ.</ul><h2>Is the gift of prophecy for today?</h2><p>Yes, the <strong>gift of prophecy</strong> is still relevant and active in the church today. In <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/1-Corinthians/12/1-Corinthians-12-7.html>1 Corinthians 12:7-11</a>, the Bible lists prophecy as one of the spiritual gifts given by the Holy Spirit for the common good of the body of Christ. As long as the church exists, the gift of prophecy will continue to be present, as it plays a vital role in guiding, encouraging, and edifying believers in <a href=/the-origin-of-the-holy-spirit-in-scripture-a-comprehensive-guide>their faith journey</a>.<p>Throughout <a href=/unveiling-the-gospel-of-thomas-ultimate-guide-and-pdf-download>the New Testament</a>, we see examples of prophetic ministry in the early church, where individuals like Agabus (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Acts/11/Acts-11-28.html>Acts 11:28</a>) and the daughters of Philip (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Acts/21/Acts-21-9.html>Acts 21:9</a>) prophesied under the leading of <a href=/ultimate-guide-best-order-to-read-the-bible-for-beginners>the Holy Spirit</a>. Today, the gift of prophecy operates within the context of the church, bringing God's timely and relevant messages to His people. It serves as a source of spiritual guidance, comfort, and confirmation of God's word in the lives of believers.<ul><li><p>The gift of prophecy is not just about predicting the future, but also about speaking forth God's truth and will in the present moment. It can bring conviction, encouragement, and direction to individuals and the church as a whole.</p><li><p>It is important for those operating in the gift of prophecy to submit their words to the discernment of mature spiritual leaders and the authority of Scripture. This helps to ensure that the prophetic messages align with God's character and are in line with His Word.</p><li><p>The gift of prophecy is not limited to a select few individuals, but is available to all believers who are open to hearing from God and speaking His truth. It is a gift that can be cultivated and developed through prayer, study of the Word, and practice in listening to the Holy Spirit's leading.</p></ul><h2>What is the spiritual gift of prophecy?</h2></section><div class=author-info><img alt="Maisha Johnson" class=author-image loading=lazy src=https://biblebasedliving.com/images/profile.png><div class=author-details><h4>Maisha Johnson</h4><p>Written by Maisha Johnson, a dedicated Christian writer known for her inspiring narratives and deep spiritual insights.

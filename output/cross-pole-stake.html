Redemption</h2><p>The cross holds a special place in Christianity as one of the most beloved symbols. It is seen in churches, jewelry, books, and various other forms of expression. The empty cross represents the work of our Savior, Jesus Christ, who willingly gave His life to pay for our sins. When Jesus uttered the words "It is finished" before His death (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/John/19/John-19-30.html>John 19:30</a>), He signified the fulfillment of the Law, the completion of Messianic prophecies related to His first coming, and the accomplishment of redemption. The cross has become a symbol that encapsulates the greatest story ever told—the sacrificial death of Christ.<h3>The Shape of the Cross</h3><p>While the Bible does not explicitly describe the precise shape of the object on which Jesus was crucified, it does use the Greek word "stauros," which refers to a pole or cross used as an instrument of capital punishment. The corresponding verb "stauroó" means "to be attached to a pole or cross." Outside of the Bible, this verb was also used in the context of putting up a fence with stakes. Although "stauros" can mean either "pole" or "stake," many scholars argue that Jesus likely died on a cross where the upright beam projected above the shorter crosspiece. However, it is important to note that an airtight biblical case cannot be made for either a cross or a pole/stake. Historical records show that Romans crucified people using various objects such as crosses, poles, stakes, upside-down crosses, X-shaped crosses, walls, roofs, and more. The specific shape on which Jesus was crucified does not affect the perfection or sufficiency of His sacrifice.<h3>Countering Alternative Views</h3><p>Certain groups, such as Jehovah's Witnesses, vehemently assert that Jesus did not die on a cross and claim that the cross is a pagan symbol. However, their position is curious given the ambiguity of the Greek word "stauros." Additionally, they deny the deity of Christ and His bodily resurrection, further questioning their objections to traditional Christian beliefs. It is important to examine alternative views with an open mind and consider the evidence presented in the Bible.<h3>Clues in the New Testament</h3><p>Although the Bible does not provide a direct description of the shape of the cross, there are some indirect clues that suggest Jesus was crucified on a cross. In John 21, Jesus gives Peter a glimpse of the manner of his death, saying, "'When you are old, you will stretch out your hands, and someone else will dress you and lead you where you do not want to go.' Jesus said this to indicate the kind of death by which Peter would glorify God" (verses 18-19). The mention of Peter stretching out his hands implies that Roman crucifixion typically involved outspread arms positioned on a crosspiece. Another clue can be found in John 20 when Thomas doubts Jesus' resurrection. Thomas says, "Unless I see the nail marks in his hands and put my finger where the nails were, and put my hand into his side, I will not believe" (verse 25). Thomas' mention of nail marks in Jesus' hands suggests a traditional cross since a stake or pole would require only one nail. These indirect clues indicate that Jesus was likely crucified on a cross.<h3>The Significance of the Cross</h3><p>While debates about the shape of the cross may continue, it is crucial to remember the significance it holds for believers. Jesus instructed His followers, saying, "If anyone would come after me, he must deny himself and take up his cross and follow me. For whoever wants to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for me will find it" (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/16/Matthew-16-24.html>Matthew 16:24</a>–25). The cross, regardless of its shape, was an instrument of death. By calling us to take up our cross and follow Him, Jesus teaches that true followers must die to self. This involves crucifying self-righteousness, self-promotion, and selfish ambitions in order to be His disciples. While martyrdom may represent the extreme form of losing our lives for Christ's sake, even in peaceful times, we must be willing to let go of ourselves. Those who are not willing to do so are "not worthy" of Him (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/10/Matthew-10-38.html>Matthew 10:38</a>).</p><iframe allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen frameborder=0 height=315 src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/s2H6_QZZUMc width=560></iframe><h3>Why This Matters</h3><p>Understanding the shape of the cross is not a matter of salvation or the core doctrines of Christianity. The Bible does not explicitly state the exact shape, and it does not affect the essential truths of Jesus' sacrificial death and resurrection. While it is interesting to explore historical and biblical evidence regarding the shape of the cross, our focus should always remain on the significance of Jesus' sacrifice and our response as His followers.<h3>Think About It</h3><p>Reflecting on the symbolism of the cross, what does it mean for you personally to take up your cross and follow Jesus? How can you apply this concept in your daily life? Consider areas where self-centeredness may hinder your ability to fully embrace the call to deny yourself and live for Christ.<p>In conclusion, while the precise shape of the object on which Jesus was crucified cannot be definitively determined from the Bible, historical evidence suggests that He likely died on a cross. However, regardless of its shape, the cross represents the sacrificial death of Jesus Christ and holds deep significance for Christians. It reminds us to deny ourselves and follow Him, allowing His love and teachings to transform our lives.</section><div class=author-info><img alt="Maisha Johnson" class=author-image loading=lazy src=https://biblebasedliving.com/images/profile.png><div class=author-details><h4>Maisha Johnson</h4><p>Written by Maisha Johnson, a dedicated Christian writer known for her inspiring narratives and deep spiritual insights.

Some people question whether Jesus was a real historical figure or simply a mythical character. In this article, we will explore the evidence for the existence of Jesus from both biblical and secular sources.<h3>The New Testament: A Reliable Source</h3><p>The New Testament is often questioned as a reliable source for evidence of Jesus' existence. However, it contains numerous references to Jesus Christ, which cannot be dismissed outright. While some suggest that the Gospels were written in the second century AD, over 100 years after Jesus' death, this view is strongly disputed. Even if we were to accept this dating, it is essential to note that ancient writings from less than 200 years after the events are considered highly reliable evidence.<p>Furthermore, the Epistles of Paul, which most scholars agree were written in the middle of the first century AD, less than 40 years after Jesus' death, provide significant evidence of Jesus' existence. These early writings offer compelling testimonies about Jesus and his teachings.<h3>Secular Historical Sources</h3><p>Secular historical sources also provide valuable insights into the existence of Jesus. While these sources may not hold the same religious significance as biblical texts, they offer an external perspective on Jesus and his impact during his time.<ol><li><p><strong>Tacitus</strong>: Tacitus was a first-century Roman historian considered to be one of the more accurate historians of the ancient world. He mentioned "Christians" who suffered under Pontius Pilate during the reign of Tiberius. This reference confirms the existence of Christ and the persecution faced by early Christians.</p><li><p><strong>Suetonius</strong>: Suetonius, chief secretary to Emperor Hadrian, wrote about a man named Chrestus (or Christ) who lived during the first century AD. Although brief, this reference provides further confirmation of Jesus' existence.</p><li><p><strong>Flavius Josephus</strong>: Josephus, a renowned Jewish historian from the first century AD, referred to James, "the brother of Jesus, who was called Christ." In one disputed passage, he also described Jesus as a wise man who performed astonishing feats and appeared to his disciples after his crucifixion. While some scholars question the authenticity of this specific passage, it is noteworthy that Josephus mentioned Jesus in his writings.</p><li><p><strong>Julius Africanus</strong>: Julius Africanus, a third-century Christian writer, quoted the historian Thallus regarding the darkness that followed Jesus' crucifixion. This reference provides an independent account of the events surrounding Jesus' death.</p><li><p><strong>Pliny the Younger</strong>: Pliny the Younger, a second-century Roman author, described early Christian worship practices and their belief in Jesus as God. He also mentioned their ethical conduct and observance of rituals like the love feast and Lord's Supper.</p><li><p><strong>Talmud</strong>: The Talmud, a collection of Jewish texts, makes references to Jesus' crucifixion on the eve of Passover and accuses him of practicing sorcery and encouraging apostasy among Jews.</p></ol><iframe allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen frameborder=0 height=315 src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/SRfFLjWLybA width=560></iframe><ol><li><p><strong>Lucian of Samosata</strong>: Lucian, a second-century Greek writer, acknowledged that Jesus was worshipped by Christians, introduced new teachings, and was crucified for them. He described the beliefs and practices of Christians during that time.</p><li><p><strong>Mara Bar-Serapion</strong>: Mara Bar-Serapion, a first-century Syrian philosopher, wrote a letter mentioning Jesus as a wise and virtuous man who was considered the king of Israel. He noted that Jesus was put to death by the Jews but continued to live on through his followers' teachings.</p></ol><p>These secular sources provide external confirmation of Jesus' existence and shed light on how he was perceived during his time.<h3>Why This Matters</h3><p>The existence of Jesus is a fundamental aspect of Christian faith. Accepting the historical reality of Jesus lays the foundation for understanding his teachings, his sacrificial death on the cross, and his resurrection. It affirms the central beliefs of Christianity and the impact Jesus had on both his contemporaries and subsequent generations.<h3>Think About It</h3><p>Considering the evidence presented, it is important to reflect on the significance of Jesus' existence. The fact that multiple secular sources from different time periods mention Jesus underscores the historical validity of his life and ministry. It challenges us to question our own beliefs and consider the impact Jesus has had on human history. Whether you are a believer or skeptic, examining the evidence for Jesus' existence can lead to a deeper understanding of his teachings and their relevance in today's world.</section><div class=author-info><img alt="Maisha Johnson" class=author-image loading=lazy src=https://biblebasedliving.com/images/profile.png><div class=author-details><h4>Maisha Johnson</h4><p>Written by Maisha Johnson, a dedicated Christian writer known for her inspiring narratives and deep spiritual insights.

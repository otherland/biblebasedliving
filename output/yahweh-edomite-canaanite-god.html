started out as an Edomite, Midianite, or Canaanite deity is a modern myth promoted by secular scholars. These scholars often have a bias against the possibility that God is who the Bible says He is - the one-and-only Creator, Author of life, Judge, and Savior of the world. They assume that humans made God in their image rather than acknowledging that God made humans in His image.<p>The false theory that Yahweh was created out of the chief god of Edom with influence from Midian relies on a few points. During the Exodus out of Egypt, Israel had to pass by the nations of Edom and Midian on their way to the Promised Land (Canaan). It is suggested that during their forty years in the wilderness, as they fashioned a new religion, Israel was influenced by the religious beliefs of Edom and Midian.<p>The Midianites were descendants of Midian, a son of Abraham. They had a priest named Reuel or Jethro who was Moses' father-in-law. The theory suggests that Moses brought much of his father-in-law's theology into his own new religion and Scripture, including Jethro's gods. It is also pointed out that there is an obscure reference in a 13th-century BC Egyptian document to a region in Edom associated with a deity named Yahweh.<p>Moreover, Edom, populated by descendants of Esau (Abraham's grandson and Israel's brother), worshiped a local god named Qos. Certain Bible verses show that Israel's God acted in some of the same places as Qos, leading some to believe that the Hebrew concept of God may be based on Edom's Qos.<p>However, these arguments are not strong enough to support the theory that Yahweh was borrowed from local mythologies in Edom and Midian. The idea that Yahweh is linked to the god of Edom because of His localized actions is an invalid conclusion. The Bible speaks of God's appearing and acting in many specific locations, and there is no reason to conclude that the biblical writers were confused about whether God was a local deity or the Creator of the universe.<h3>Why This Matters</h3><p>Understanding the origins of Yahweh is crucial because it informs our understanding of who He is and how we relate to Him. If Yahweh is simply a human creation, then His authority and power are called into question. However, if Yahweh is indeed the one true God as revealed in Scripture, then we can trust in His sovereignty, love, and guidance.<h3>Think About It</h3><p>Consider the implications if Yahweh were merely a human invention. How would this impact your relationship with Him? How does your understanding of Yahweh's character influence your faith and trust in Him?<h2>The Flawed Theory of Yahweh's Origins</h2><iframe allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen frameborder=0 height=315 src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/mdKst8zeh-U width=560></iframe><p>The theory that Yahweh started out as an Edomite, Midianite, or Canaanite deity rests on weak arguments that do not hold up to scrutiny. Let us examine these arguments in more detail:<ol><li><strong>Influence from Edom and Midian</strong>: The theory suggests that Israel, during their time in the wilderness, was influenced by the religious beliefs of Edom and Midian. However, there is no substantial evidence to support this claim. The Israelites were led by Moses, who received direct revelation from God on Mount Sinai. Their worship and religious practices were guided by divine instruction.</ol><p><strong>Think About It</strong>: How does knowing that the Israelites' religious practices were guided by divine instruction impact your understanding of the origins of Yahweh?<ol><li><strong>Moses' Father-in-Law</strong>: The theory suggests that Moses' father-in-law, Jethro, influenced his theology and introduced him to different gods. However, it is important to note that Jethro acknowledged Yahweh as the one true God and offered sacrifices to Him (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Exodus/18/Exodus-18-10.html>Exodus 18:10-12</a>). It is unlikely that Jethro's beliefs had a significant influence on Moses' understanding of Yahweh.</ol><p><strong>Think About It</strong>: How does Jethro's acknowledgment of Yahweh as the one true God impact your understanding of Yahweh's origins?<ol><li><strong>Obscure Egyptian Reference</strong>: The theory points to an obscure reference in a 13th-century BC Egyptian document that mentions a region in Edom associated with a deity named Yahweh. However, this reference is not definitive proof of Yahweh's origins or the influence of Edomite mythology on Israelite theology. It is important to consider the broader context and weight of evidence when evaluating such claims.</ol><p><strong>Think About It</strong>: How does the lack of substantial evidence linking Yahweh to Edomite mythology impact your understanding of His origins?<ol><li><strong>Similarities with Edom's Qos</strong>: The theory suggests that the Hebrew concept of God may be based on Edom's local god, Qos, due to similarities in certain Bible verses. However, these verses simply describe God's actions in specific locations, and they do not imply that Yahweh is derived from Qos or any other local deity. The Bible consistently portrays Yahweh as the Creator and Lord over all creation.</ol><p><strong>Think About It</strong>: How does recognizing God's sovereignty over all creation impact your understanding of His uniqueness and authority?<h3>Why This Matters</h3><p>The flawed theory of Yahweh's origins highlights the importance of critically evaluating claims and theories about biblical texts and theology. It reminds us to approach scholarly theories with discernment and to rely on the authority of Scripture as the ultimate source of truth.<h3>Think About It</h3><p>Reflect on how your understanding of Yahweh's origins impacts your faith in Him. How does the belief that Yahweh is the one true God, as revealed in Scripture, shape your perspective on His character and promises?<h2>The Truth about Yahweh</h2><p>The theory that Yahweh originated from Edomite, Midianite, or Canaanite mythology lacks solid evidence and relies on weak arguments. The idea that Yahweh was a human invention or borrowed from local mythologies contradicts the biblical portrayal of God as the one true Creator and Lord over all creation.<p>When we examine the Bible, we find that Yahweh's self-revelation and interaction with His people are consistent throughout. He reveals Himself to be the great "I Am" (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Exodus/3/Exodus-3-13.html>Exodus 3:13-14</a>), the God who created the heavens and the earth (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/1/Genesis-1-1.html>Genesis 1:1</a>), and the Savior who offers eternal life through faith in Jesus Christ (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/John/3/John-3-16.html>John 3:16</a>).<p>Yahweh's uniqueness and authority are affirmed throughout Scripture. He is described as the Holy One, whose glory covers the heavens and fills the earth (Habakkuk 3:3a). He is not limited to a specific location or influenced by human mythologies.<h3>Why This Matters</h3><p>Recognizing Yahweh as the one true God, as revealed in Scripture, is foundational to our faith. It assures us of His sovereignty, love, and faithfulness. Understanding His true nature allows us to trust in Him completely and find hope in His promises.<h3>Think About It</h3><p>Consider how your belief in Yahweh as the one true God impacts your relationship with Him. How does knowing that He is sovereign over all creation and faithful to His promises strengthen your faith?</section><div class=author-info><img alt="Maisha Johnson" class=author-image loading=lazy src=https://biblebasedliving.com/images/profile.png><div class=author-details><h4>Maisha Johnson</h4><p>Written by Maisha Johnson, a dedicated Christian writer known for her inspiring narratives and deep spiritual insights.

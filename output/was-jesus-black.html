Some argue vehemently that Jesus was black or of African descent in terms of his skin color and appearance. However, it is important to note that the Bible clearly declares Jesus' Jewishness, suggesting that he likely had light to dark brown skin. Nonetheless, the discussion about Jesus' skin color misses a crucial point: does it truly matter what color Jesus' skin was? Ultimately, the Bible provides little, if any, description of Jesus' physical appearance, indicating that his skin color is not a significant aspect of his identity.</p><iframe allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen frameborder=0 height=315 src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/jLWvxUBsRGk width=560></iframe><p>The prophet Isaiah provides the most detailed description of Jesus' physical appearance in the Bible. He states, "He grew up before him like a tender shoot, and like a root out of dry ground. He had no beauty or majesty to attract us to him, nothing in his appearance that we should desire him" (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/53/Isaiah-53-2.html>Isaiah 53:2</a>). This verse suggests that Jesus did not possess any outstanding physical attributes or exceptional beauty that would draw attention or desire from others. If Jesus' skin color and complexion were important, God would have provided more information about them in Scripture. Therefore, speculating on the color of Jesus' skin is futile and can lead to unproductive quarrels.<p>In <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Ephesians/1/Ephesians-1-7.html>Ephesians 1:7</a> and <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Colossians/1/Colossians-1-14.html>Colossians 1:14</a>, we learn that the color of Jesus' skin is irrelevant in the grand scheme of redemption. These verses emphasize the importance of Christ's sacrifice for our salvation, rather than focusing on his physical appearance. Instead of fixating on Jesus' external features, we are called to focus on his divine power and strive for a life of godliness and moral excellence.<p>Additionally, the Bible teaches us that God does not show favoritism based on race or nationality. In <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Acts/10/Acts-10-34.html>Acts 10:34-35</a>, Peter declares that God accepts people from every nation who fear Him and do what is right. This means that there are no cultural or racial barriers in Christianity, and we are all united in Christ Jesus. <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Galatians/3/Galatians-3-28.html>Galatians 3:28</a> reiterates this message by stating, "There is neither Jew nor Greek, slave nor free, male nor female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus." The color of our Savior's skin should not affect our ability to share the gospel with others, and it should not hinder our relationships with people of different races or ethnicities.<p>The apostles of the first-century church adapted to different cultures when spreading the gospel, but they never compromised their fidelity to the teachings of Christ (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/1-Corinthians/9/1-Corinthians-9-19.html>1 Corinthians 9:19-23</a>). The method of teaching may have changed depending on the audience, but the message remained consistent. The gospel of Christ reaches the hearts of those who seek to know God, regardless of their race or skin color.<p>In conclusion, while there are debates about Jesus' skin color, the Bible does not provide a clear answer. It is important to remember that Jesus' physical appearance is not a significant aspect of his identity or the message of the gospel. Rather than focusing on external features, we should center our attention on the redemptive work of Christ and strive for a life of godliness and moral excellence. Ultimately, salvation is found in Jesus alone, regardless of the color of his skin or the skin color of those we encounter in our mission to share the gospel.</section><div class=author-info><img alt="Maisha Johnson" class=author-image loading=lazy src=https://biblebasedliving.com/images/profile.png><div class=author-details><h4>Maisha Johnson</h4><p>Written by Maisha Johnson, a dedicated Christian writer known for her inspiring narratives and deep spiritual insights.

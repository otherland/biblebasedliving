form of execution by torture that was "perfected" by the Romans and used as a deterrent to prevent people from crossing the Roman government. It was invented by other people groups, such as the Persians, Assyrians, Greeks, and Carthaginians, but the Romans took it to new levels of horror.<h3>The Process of Crucifixion</h3><p>The victim of crucifixion would first be severely scourged or beaten, an ordeal that was life-threatening on its own. After this brutal beating, the victim would be forced to carry the large wooden crossbeam to the site of crucifixion, adding physical pain and shame as they carried the instrument of their own torture and death.<p>Once at the place of crucifixion, the victim would be stripped naked to further shame them. Their arms would be stretched out on the crossbeam and nailed in place. The nails were hammered through the wrists, not the palms, to prevent them from pulling through. The placement of the nails in the wrists also caused excruciating pain as they pressed on large nerves running to the hands.<p>The crossbeam would then be hoisted up and fastened to an upright piece that remained standing between crucifixions. The victim's feet would also be nailed to the cross, one foot on top of the other, through the middle and arch of each foot, with slightly bent knees. The primary purpose of these nails was to inflict pain.<h3>The Agony and Torture</h3><p>Once fastened to the cross, all of the victim's weight was supported by three nails, causing pain to shoot throughout their body. The victim's arms were stretched out in a way that caused cramping and paralysis in the chest muscles, making it impossible to breathe unless some weight was borne by their feet. In order to take a breath, they had to push up with their feet.<p>As they tried to breathe and relieve some of the pain in their feet, the victim would begin to slump down again, putting more weight on their wrists and rubbing their raw back against the cross. However, in this lowered position, they could not breathe, so the torturous process would repeat. The victim had to constantly push up with their feet to breathe and relieve some of the pain caused by the wrist nails, while also enduring the intense pain caused by the foot nail.</p><iframe allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen frameborder=0 height=315 src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/EpFhS0dAduc width=560></iframe><p>Crucifixion usually led to a slow, tortuous death, with some victims lasting as long as four days on the cross. Death came from asphyxiation as the victim lost the strength to continue pushing up on their feet to take a breath. In some cases, the victim's legs might be broken to hasten death by preventing them from pushing up to breathe.<h3>Why This Matters</h3><p>Understanding the brutal nature of crucifixion helps us grasp the immense suffering that Jesus endured for our salvation. The crucifixion was not only physically agonizing but also deeply humiliating. Jesus willingly endured this excruciating death on the cross because of His great love for us. His sacrifice provides a way for us to be forgiven and reconciled with God.<h3>Think About It</h3><p>Take a moment to reflect on the extreme pain and humiliation that Jesus experienced during His crucifixion. Consider how His willingness to endure this horrific death demonstrates His sacrificial love for humanity. How does knowing about the details of crucifixion deepen your appreciation for Jesus' sacrifice on your behalf?</section><div class=author-info><img alt="Maisha Johnson" class=author-image loading=lazy src=https://biblebasedliving.com/images/profile.png><div class=author-details><h4>Maisha Johnson</h4><p>Written by Maisha Johnson, a dedicated Christian writer known for her inspiring narratives and deep spiritual insights.

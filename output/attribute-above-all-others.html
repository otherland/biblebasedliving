are two important considerations: which attributes are most important for us to understand, and whether some attributes are more important for God Himself. From a human perspective, our understanding of God's qualities must come in a certain order because we are not infinite or perfect. However, when we look at the attributes of God, we find that they are all equally perfect and unchangeable. There is no practical difference in their importance to God.<h3>The Equally Perfect Attributes of God</h3><p>In order for a being to be truly "infinitely" perfect, they must be perfect in all qualities. For example, a being cannot have all possible power without also having all possible knowledge. All of God's attributes exist in cooperation with one another and cannot be ranked on a scale of importance. They are equally perfect, infinite, and ranked.</p><iframe allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen frameborder=0 height=315 src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/BtUNFuUpXu8 width=560></iframe><h3>The Starting Point: God's Holiness</h3><p>From a human perspective, the starting point for understanding who God is His holiness. God's holiness means that He is set apart from mankind in a radical and fundamental way. He is perfection without any unrighteousness. Without recognizing this uniqueness, none of His other qualities make sense.<h3>Building Blocks for Understanding God's Attributes</h3><p>Before we can fully grasp certain attributes of God that are more connected to human experience, we need to understand those that are "beyond" mankind. God's holiness, sovereignty, and omnipotence serve as crucial foundations for our understanding of His other qualities such as love and justice. Although none of God's qualities are "more" or "less" present than the others due to His perfection, we can arrange them in a logical order to help our limited human minds comprehend Him. This logical order starts with His holiness, extends to His power (omnipotence, sovereignty), and then to His personality (love, mercy, justice).<h3>Why This Matters</h3><p>Understanding God's attributes is crucial for our relationship with Him. It allows us to grasp a glimpse of His nature and character, and it shapes our understanding of His actions and dealings with humanity. Recognizing God's holiness helps us approach Him with reverence and awe. Appreciating His sovereignty and power enables us to trust in His control over all things. Understanding His love, mercy, and justice helps us relate to Him on a personal level and comprehend His plans for our lives.<h3>Think About It</h3><p>Reflecting on God's attributes can lead to a deeper relationship with Him. Consider how your understanding of God's holiness has shaped your perception of Him. How does recognizing His sovereignty and power impact your trust in Him? How does knowing His love, mercy, and justice influence your relationship with Him and others? Take time to meditate on these attributes and their significance in your walk with God.<p>In conclusion, while all of God's attributes are equally perfect and important to who He is, our understanding of them must come in a certain order due to our limited human perspective. Starting with God's holiness as the foundation, we can build upon that understanding to grasp His power and personality. Reflecting on these attributes deepens our relationship with God and shapes our understanding of His nature and character. Let us continually seek to know Him more fully by exploring His attributes and drawing near to Him.</section><div class=author-info><img alt="Maisha Johnson" class=author-image loading=lazy src=https://biblebasedliving.com/images/profile.png><div class=author-details><h4>Maisha Johnson</h4><p>Written by Maisha Johnson, a dedicated Christian writer known for her inspiring narratives and deep spiritual insights.

href=https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/1/Matthew-1-18.html>Matthew 1:18</a>–25; 2:1–12 and <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/1/Luke-1-26.html>Luke 1:26</a>–38; 2:1–20. According to the accounts, at the time of Mary's pregnancy, Caesar Augustus issued a decree that required everyone in the Roman territory to be registered for a census. This meant that Joseph, who lived in Nazareth, had to travel to Bethlehem, the city of David, because he was of the lineage of David.<p>When Mary and Joseph arrived in Bethlehem, they found that the city was already crowded with people who had come for the census. There was no room for them in the inn, so they took refuge in a place where animals were kept. Although the Bible does not specifically mention animals being present at the birth of Jesus, it does mention that he was laid in a manger, which suggests that there were animals nearby.<p>Traditionally, the "inn" referred to in <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/2/Luke-2-7.html>Luke 2:7</a> is believed to be a commercial hotel, and the place where Mary and Joseph took shelter is thought to be a stable. However, it is also possible that the Greek word translated as "inn" could refer to a guest room in a private home where guests were staying, with a separate area used to house animals.<p>Archaeological findings have revealed different types of homes in Bethlehem at that time. Some homes had a lower level where animals were kept separate from where people lived. Others had a wall separating the front of the house from the back, where animals were kept safe. In both cases, there would have been an indoor animal shelter connected to the house in some way. Regardless of the exact location, it is clear from <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/2/Luke-2-7.html>Luke 2:7</a> that Jesus was born in humble surroundings and laid in a manger.<p>Another theory suggests that Jesus may have been born in Migdol Eder, a watchtower with a place underneath used by shepherds during the lambing season to shelter newborn lambs. This theory is based on the mention of Migdol Eder in <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Micah/4/Micah-4-8.html>Micah 4:8</a>, which also prophesies Bethlehem as the birthplace of the Messiah. This theory explains why the shepherds who received the angelic message about Jesus knew exactly where to find him. It would be fitting for the Messiah to be born in the same place where sacrificial lambs were born.<p>Regardless of whether Jesus was born in an indoor animal shelter, a separate barn, or a tower used for lambing, what is clear from the Bible is that his birth took place in a humble setting in Bethlehem, fulfilling the prophecy of Micah.<h3>Why This Matters</h3><iframe allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen frameborder=0 height=315 src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/6fFqFNH3uGw width=560></iframe><p>Understanding where Jesus was born helps us grasp the significance and fulfillment of biblical prophecies. The fact that Jesus was born in Bethlehem, just as Micah had prophesied, confirms that he is indeed the Messiah that was promised. It also highlights the humility and humanity of Jesus, who came into this world in humble surroundings rather than being born into wealth or royalty.<p>Knowing the historical context and details of Jesus' birth can deepen our appreciation for God's plan of salvation. It reminds us that God chose to enter our world as a vulnerable baby, experiencing the same human condition we all share. This ultimately leads us to reflect on the purpose of Jesus' birth and his mission to save humanity from sin and reconcile us with God.<h3>Think About It</h3><ol><li>Consider the significance of Jesus being born in Bethlehem, fulfilling ancient prophecies. How does this reinforce your faith in God's plan and his faithfulness to fulfill his promises?<li>Reflect on the humility of Jesus' birth and how it challenges our cultural expectations of power and glory. How does his humble beginnings shape your understanding of who Jesus is and what he came to accomplish?<li>Contemplate the fact that Jesus, the Son of God, willingly entered our world as a vulnerable baby. How does this impact your understanding of God's love and compassion for humanity?</ol></section><div class=author-info><img alt="Maisha Johnson" class=author-image loading=lazy src=https://biblebasedliving.com/images/profile.png><div class=author-details><h4>Maisha Johnson</h4><p>Written by Maisha Johnson, a dedicated Christian writer known for her inspiring narratives and deep spiritual insights.

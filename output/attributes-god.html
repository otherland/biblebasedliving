like. Without relying on the authority of the Bible, any attempt to explain God's attributes would be no better than an opinion, which is often incorrect when it comes to understanding God. It is crucial for us to try to understand what God is like because failure to do so can lead us to set up false gods and worship them against His will.<h3>The Self-Revealing Nature of God</h3><p>God has chosen to reveal knowledge of Himself through creation, the Bible, and the Word made flesh—Jesus Christ. Creation itself offers a glimpse of God's works and reveals His awesomeness through its vastness, complexity, beauty, and order. By considering these aspects of creation, we can begin to grasp the greatness of God.<h3>Names of God</h3><p>Reading through some of the names of God can also help us understand what He is like. Here are a few examples:<ol><li>Elohim - This name refers to God as the strong One, divine.<li>Adonai - It signifies a Lord who establishes a Master-to-servant relationship.<li>El Elyon - This name emphasizes that God is the Most High, the strongest One.<li>El Roi - It means that God is the strong One who sees everything.<li>El Shaddai - This name highlights that God is Almighty.<li>El Olam - It signifies that God is the Everlasting God.<li>Yahweh - This name means "I AM" and represents the eternal, self-existent nature of God.</ol><h3>The Attributes of God</h3><ol><li><p><strong>Eternal and Immutable</strong>: God is eternal, meaning He had no beginning and will never cease to exist. He is immortal and infinite. Furthermore, God is unchanging (immutable), making Him absolutely reliable and trustworthy.</p><li><p><strong>Incomparable and Perfect</strong>: God is unparalleled in His works and being. He is unequaled and perfect. There is no one like Him.</p><li><p><strong>Inscrutable and Omniscient</strong>: God is inscrutable, unfathomable, unsearchable, and beyond complete understanding. However, He is omniscient, meaning He knows everything—the past, present, and future—along with our thoughts.</p><li><p><strong>Just and Omnipotent</strong>: God is just and does not show favoritism. He is also omnipotent, possessing all power. However, His actions are always in line with His character.</p><li><p><strong>Omnipresent and Sovereign</strong>: God is omnipresent, meaning He is present everywhere. Yet, this does not mean that God is everything. Additionally, God is sovereign—supreme over all creation, with all of His purposes prevailing.</p></ol><iframe allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen frameborder=0 height=315 src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/YfeZSRnQnI8 width=560></iframe><ol><li><p><strong>Spirit and Truth</strong>: God is spirit, invisible to human eyes. He cannot be seen with physical senses but can be experienced through faith. Moreover, God is truth itself; He cannot lie or be corrupt.</p><li><p><strong>Holy and Gracious</strong>: God is holy, separate from all moral defilement and hostile toward evil. He sees all wrongdoings and hates them. However, He is also gracious and extends His goodness, kindness, mercy, and love to us.</p><li><p><strong>One and Righteous</strong>: God is one; there is no other like Him who can meet the deepest needs of our hearts. He alone deserves our worship and devotion. Furthermore, God is righteous—He cannot overlook wrongdoing, which required Jesus to experience God's wrath for our sins to be forgiven.</p></ol><h3>Why This Matters</h3><p>Understanding the attributes of God is crucial for our faith. It helps us develop a proper understanding of who God is and how we should relate to Him. Knowing that God is eternal, immutable, and omnipotent gives us confidence in His promises and trustworthiness. Recognizing God's justice and righteousness reminds us of the seriousness of sin and the need for forgiveness through Jesus Christ. Understanding God's holiness and grace helps us appreciate His love and mercy towards us.<h3>Think About It</h3><p>Reflecting on the attributes of God can lead us to a deeper appreciation of His character and nature. Consider the following questions:<ol><li>How does knowing that God is eternal and unchanging impact your trust in Him?<li>In what ways does understanding God's justice and righteousness affect your view of sin and the need for forgiveness?<li>How does recognizing God's holiness and grace influence your understanding of His love for you?</ol><p>By pondering these questions, we can deepen our relationship with God and grow in our understanding of His attributes.</section><div class=author-info><img alt="Maisha Johnson" class=author-image loading=lazy src=https://biblebasedliving.com/images/profile.png><div class=author-details><h4>Maisha Johnson</h4><p>Written by Maisha Johnson, a dedicated Christian writer known for her inspiring narratives and deep spiritual insights.

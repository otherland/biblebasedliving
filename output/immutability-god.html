It is a concept clearly taught throughout Scripture. In <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Malachi/3/Malachi-3-6.html>Malachi 3:6</a>, God affirms, "I the Lord do not change." This sentiment is echoed in other verses such as <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Numbers/23/Numbers-23-19.html>Numbers 23:19</a>, <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/1-Samuel/15/1-Samuel-15-29.html>1 Samuel 15:29</a>, <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/46/Isaiah-46-9.html>Isaiah 46:9-11</a>, and <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Ezekiel/24/Ezekiel-24-14.html>Ezekiel 24:14</a>. <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/James/1/James-1-17.html>James 1:17</a> also teaches the immutability of God, stating that every good and perfect gift comes from Him and there is no variableness or shadow of turning in Him.<p>To understand the immutability of God, we can think of it in terms of the sun. The sun rises and sets, appears and disappears every day. It moves across the sky and casts its shadow. But with God, who is light itself, there is no darkness at all. There is no change with Him, nor anything like it. He is unchangeable in His nature, perfections, purposes, promises, and gifts.<p>There are several logical reasons why God must be immutable. First, for change to occur, there must be a chronological order. There must be a point in time before the change and a point in time after the change. However, God exists outside of the constraints of time. He is eternal (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/33/Psalm-33-11.html>Psalm 33:11</a>; 41:13; 90:2-4; <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/John/17/John-17-5.html>John 17:5</a>; <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/2-Timothy/1/2-Timothy-1-9.html>2 Timothy 1:9</a>), and therefore not subject to the limitations of time.<p>Secondly, the immutability of God is necessary for His perfection. If anything changes, it must either change for the better or the worse. But since God is perfect, He does not need anything. Therefore, He cannot change for the better or the worse.<p>Thirdly, the immutability of God is related to His omniscience. When someone changes their mind, it is often because new information has come to light or the circumstances have changed. But God is omniscient and knows all things. He cannot learn something new that He did not already know. So, when the Bible speaks of God changing His mind, it is describing a change in dispensation and outward dealings toward man, not a change in God Himself.</p><iframe allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen frameborder=0 height=315 src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/pvhBX_5z0fw width=560></iframe><p><a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Numbers/23/Numbers-23-19.html>Numbers 23:19</a> affirms the immutability of God, stating that He is not a man that He should lie or change His mind. This verse emphasizes that God does not change His mind. The doctrine of God's immutability is further affirmed throughout Scripture.<h3>Why This Matters</h3><p>Understanding the immutability of God is important for our faith and relationship with Him. It assures us that God's character and promises remain constant. We can trust in His unchanging nature and rely on His faithfulness. It also reminds us that God's love and grace are not subject to fluctuation or alteration. His love for us is steadfast and unchanging.<p>The immutability of God also has implications for our own lives. If we serve a God who does not change, we can have confidence in His guidance and direction. We don't have to worry about God changing His mind about us or His plans for our lives. This stability and constancy provide us with security and peace.<h3>Think About It</h3><ol><li><p>How does the immutability of God impact your understanding of His character?</p><li><p>In what ways does the concept of an unchanging God bring you comfort and assurance?</p><li><p>How does knowing that God does not change affect your trust in Him and your relationship with Him?</p></ol></section><div class=author-info><img alt="Maisha Johnson" class=author-image loading=lazy src=https://biblebasedliving.com/images/profile.png><div class=author-details><h4>Maisha Johnson</h4><p>Written by Maisha Johnson, a dedicated Christian writer known for her inspiring narratives and deep spiritual insights.

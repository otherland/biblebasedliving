unmeasurable. This means that God is free from all limitations and cannot be confined or restricted by anything in the universe. All of God's attributes, such as holiness, love, and wisdom, are infinite and perfect. It's important to note that when we say something is "unmeasurable," it doesn't necessarily mean it is infinite or unlimited in the same way that God is. The concept of being unmeasurable or unlimited is subject to the limitations of the measurer.<p>From a logical perspective, there has to be a single "First Cause" that is necessary for everything else to exist. Rather than making God impossible, logic actually makes Him necessary. God is not just a part of reality; He is reality itself. While there are things in existence that are not God, He is still the ultimate source and foundation of their existence.<p>It's also worth mentioning that infinity, when it comes to God, is not a property that can be present in some attributes but not others. One must either be entirely infinite or not infinite at all. For example, to be omnipotent (having all power), one must also be omniscient (having all knowledge) and omnipresent (being present everywhere). All of God's attributes come from the same source - He is the one and only ultimate and necessary being.<p>We break down God's attributes into different categories like omnipotence, omniscience, eternality, etc., to make it easier for our finite minds to comprehend Him. However, in reality, all of these attributes stem from the fact that God is the source of everything else. He simply is - as expressed in His own words when He called Himself "I AM."</p><iframe allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen frameborder=0 height=315 src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/qSdRDurOhHE width=560></iframe><p>It's important to note that while God is infinite and unlimited, other beings cannot be truly infinite in the same sense as God. Everything that exists apart from God is a result of His creative work, and every created thing must be fundamentally different from God. Therefore, it is impossible for beings to be truly infinite like God.<p>God is not just an impersonal force or energy; He is a personal being who describes Himself as such in the Bible. This is why our reality operates the way it does. We can't expect to see communication, unity, and relationship in the created world if those properties were not present in the First Cause. In God's nature, we see the Trinity, which embodies communication, unity, and relationship. Without these properties in the First Cause, we would never witness them in the creation.<h3>Why This Matters</h3><p>Understanding the unlimited and unmeasurable nature of God has significant implications for our faith. It reminds us that God is above and beyond anything we can comprehend or measure. It humbles us and encourages us to approach Him with reverence and awe. Recognizing God's infinitude also helps us grasp His power, wisdom, and love more fully, knowing that they are limitless and perfect.<p>This understanding also helps us differentiate between God and everything else in creation. While there are aspects of creation that reflect God's attributes to some extent, they are not on the same level as God Himself. This prevents us from idolizing or worshiping created things and directs our focus solely on the Creator.<h3>Think About It</h3><ol><li>How does the concept of God being unlimited and unmeasurable impact your understanding of His attributes?<li>In what ways does recognizing God's infinitude affect your perspective on the created world?<li>How does understanding that God is a personal being impact your relationship with Him?<li>Consider how recognizing God's infinitude might shape your approach to worshiping Him.<li>Reflect on how the concept of an infinite and unlimited God offers comfort and assurance in times of difficulty or uncertainty.</ol></section><div class=author-info><img alt="Maisha Johnson" class=author-image loading=lazy src=https://biblebasedliving.com/images/profile.png><div class=author-details><h4>Maisha Johnson</h4><p>Written by Maisha Johnson, a dedicated Christian writer known for her inspiring narratives and deep spiritual insights.

God's direct interaction with people, performing miracles, speaking audibly, and revealing Himself in undeniable ways. However, many wonder why God seems hidden and silent today. In order to understand this apparent hiddenness, we need to consider several key points.<h3>1. Hiddenness Due to Sin and Unbelief</h3><p>One reason why God may seem hidden today is the presence of willful, unrepentant sin. The Bible tells us that when people cry out to the Lord but continue in their evil ways, He may hide His face from them (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Micah/3/Micah-3-4.html>Micah 3:4</a>). Additionally, without faith, it is impossible to please God (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/11/Hebrews-11-6.html>Hebrews 11:6</a>). Sometimes people fail to perceive evidence of God's presence because they refuse to believe (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/6/Mark-6-1.html>Mark 6:1-6</a>). It becomes challenging to see when one's eyes remain closed.<p><strong>Why This Matters:</strong> Recognizing the impact of sin and unbelief helps us understand why some may struggle to see or experience God's presence in their lives. It underscores the importance of repentance and faith as a means to perceive and encounter God.<p><strong>Think About It:</strong> Have you ever experienced a time when your unbelief or sinful choices hindered your ability to recognize God's presence? How did repentance and faith open your eyes?<h3>2. Progressive Revelation in History</h3><p>Far from being entirely hidden, God has revealed Himself progressively throughout history. He used miracles and direct communication with individuals to unveil His character, provide instructions, and disclose His plans. However, these moments were interspersed with times of silence when new revelation was not forthcoming (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/1-Samuel/3/1-Samuel-3-1.html>1 Samuel 3:1</a>).<p>God's first act of revelation was through creation itself. The wonders of the natural world serve as a constant reminder of His existence and display His attributes (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/1/Romans-1-20.html>Romans 1:20</a>). Creation was God's initial declaration to humanity, demonstrating His power, sovereignty, and eternality. Following creation, God spoke directly to Adam and Eve, giving them commandments and warning them of the consequences of disobedience. He also promised to send a Savior to redeem mankind from sin.<p>Throughout history, God revealed Himself intermittently. He spoke to individuals like Noah and Moses, providing guidance and delivering miracles to authenticate His messengers. Miracles were also performed during Joshua's time, as well as during the ministries of Elijah and Elisha, to confirm the prophetic word and combat idolatry. However, between these times of divine intervention, generations passed without witnessing miracles or hearing the voice of God.<p><strong>Why This Matters:</strong> Understanding the concept of progressive revelation helps us see that God's plan for unfolding His truth was not continuous miraculous events or constant audible communication. It highlights the significance of different periods in history and the unique ways God chose to reveal Himself.<p><strong>Think About It:</strong> Reflect on the various ways God has chosen to reveal Himself throughout history. How does this pattern of progressive revelation deepen your trust in His sovereignty?<h3>3. The Completed Canon of Scripture</h3><p>One reason why God may seem hidden today is that He has already completed His plan of revelation. The Bible is the finished product of God's progressive revelation to humanity (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Revelation/22/Revelation-22-18.html>Revelation 22:18</a>). The Scriptures contain everything we need for doctrine, reproof, correction, and instruction in righteousness (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/2-Timothy/3/2-Timothy-3-16.html>2 Timothy 3:16</a>). The Bible is sufficient in making us wise unto salvation through faith in Christ Jesus (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/2-Timothy/3/2-Timothy-3-15.html>2 Timothy 3:15</a>). It is a reliable source of prophecy that we should pay close attention to (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/2-Peter/1/2-Peter-1-19.html>2 Peter 1:19</a>).<p><strong>Why This Matters:</strong> Recognizing the completeness and sufficiency of Scripture helps us understand that we do not need additional miracles or revelations to validate the Bible. The Bible stands as the ultimate authority for our faith and practice.<p><strong>Think About It:</strong> How does the understanding that the Bible is complete and sufficient affect your approach to seeking spiritual guidance and truth?</p><iframe allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen frameborder=0 height=315 src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/HndJGVB3C5I width=560></iframe><h3>4. The Role of the Holy Spirit</h3><p>While God may not be speaking audibly or providing new revelations today, the Holy Spirit still plays a crucial role in our lives as believers. The Spirit serves as our Comforter (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/John/14/John-14-16.html>John 14:16</a>) and works in conjunction with our conscience to guide us. However, it's important to note that the Holy Spirit does not provide new revelations. Instead, He speaks to us through the written Word of God, which functions as the "sword of the Spirit" (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Ephesians/6/Ephesians-6-17.html>Ephesians 6:17</a>). The Holy Spirit reminds us of specific Scriptures when needed, illuminates our understanding of the Word, and empowers us to live according to its teachings (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/John/14/John-14-26.html>John 14:26</a>).<p><strong>Why This Matters:</strong> Recognizing that the Holy Spirit's role is not to provide new revelations but to guide us through Scripture helps us avoid potential pitfalls of seeking extra-biblical revelations or claiming new knowledge not found in God's Word.<p><strong>Think About It:</strong> In what ways have you experienced the guidance of the Holy Spirit through Scripture? How has this impacted your faith journey?<h3>5. Living by Faith, Not by Sight</h3><p>The prophet Habakkuk declares that "the just shall live by his faith" (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Habakkuk/2/Habakkuk-2-4.html>Habakkuk 2:4</a>). Rather than continually receiving miraculous signs, God expects His people to trust in what He has already done, search the Scriptures daily, and live by faith (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/16/Matthew-16-4.html>Matthew 16:4</a>; <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/John/20/John-20-29.html>John 20:29</a>; <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/2-Corinthians/5/2-Corinthians-5-7.html>2 Corinthians 5:7</a>). Although there may be times when it seems that God is doing nothing, He remains the sovereign Lord of all creation, constantly working to fulfill His perfect plan. The book of Esther serves as a prime example of God's hidden working, where His hand is never mentioned but is evident from beginning to end.<p><strong>Why This Matters:</strong> Understanding the call to live by faith encourages us to trust in God's sovereignty and faithfulness even in times when His presence may seem hidden. It underscores the importance of relying on His Word and maintaining a steadfast faith.<p><strong>Think About It:</strong> How has living by faith, rather than relying solely on visible signs or experiences, deepened your relationship with God?<h3>6. The Ultimate Purpose of God's Hiddenness</h3><p>While we may not fully comprehend why God chooses to be "hidden" at times, we can trust that He has a purpose in it. It is through periods of apparent hiddenness that God often works in ways we cannot immediately perceive or understand. Just as He worked behind the scenes in Esther's story, God continues to work silently, orchestrating events according to His perfect plan.<p><strong>Why This Matters:</strong> Recognizing that God works even in His hiddenness helps us maintain trust in His sovereignty and understand that there are aspects of His plan beyond our immediate perception.<p><strong>Think About It:</strong> In what ways have you witnessed God's silent work in your life or the lives of others? How does this strengthen your faith?<p>In conclusion, while it may seem that God is hidden or silent today, we can find assurance in understanding the reasons behind His apparent hiddenness. Sin and unbelief can blind us to His presence, and throughout history, God has progressively revealed Himself at specific times. The completed canon of Scripture provides us with everything we need for faith and practice. The Holy Spirit guides us through the Word of God rather than providing new revelations. Living by faith helps us trust in God's sovereignty, even when He seems hidden. Ultimately, we can find comfort in knowing that even in apparent hiddenness, God is at work, fulfilling His perfect plan.</section><div class=author-info><img alt="Maisha Johnson" class=author-image loading=lazy src=https://biblebasedliving.com/images/profile.png><div class=author-details><h4>Maisha Johnson</h4><p>Written by Maisha Johnson, a dedicated Christian writer known for her inspiring narratives and deep spiritual insights.

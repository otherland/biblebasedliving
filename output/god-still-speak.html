Moses at the burning bush (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Exodus/3/Exodus-3-14.html>Exodus 3:14</a>), Joshua before entering the Promised Land (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Joshua/1/Joshua-1-1.html>Joshua 1:1</a>), and Samuel when he was called to be a prophet (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/1-Samuel/3/1-Samuel-3-11.html>1 Samuel 3:11</a>). While these examples show that God has spoken audibly in the past, it is important to note that they occurred over a span of 4,000 years of human history and are exceptions rather than the norm.<h3>God Speaks Through His Word</h3><p>One primary way that God speaks to us today is through His Word, the Bible. The Bible is often referred to as the "Word of God" because it contains everything we need to know in order to be saved and live a Christian life. In <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/2-Timothy/3/2-Timothy-3-16.html>2 Timothy 3:16</a>–17, it says, "All Scripture is breathed out by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness, that the man of God may be complete, equipped for every good work." This passage emphasizes the divine inspiration and authority of the Scriptures.<p>The Bible is not just a collection of ancient writings; it is a living and relevant book that continues to speak to us today. When we read and study the Bible, we can hear God's voice addressing our hearts and minds. <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/55/Isaiah-55-11.html>Isaiah 55:11</a> assures us that God's Word will accomplish what He desires and achieve its purpose. So, if we want to hear from God, we need to spend time reading and meditating on His Word.<p><strong>Why This Matters:</strong> Understanding that God speaks through His Word helps us develop a deeper relationship with Him. By studying the Scriptures, we gain insight into His character, His will for our lives, and how we should live as followers of Christ.<p><strong>Think About It:</strong> How often do you spend time reading and studying the Bible? Are there specific passages or books that you find particularly meaningful or helpful in your spiritual journey?<h3>God Speaks Through Events and Circumstances</h3><p>Another way that God speaks to us is through events and circumstances in our lives. God can guide us by arranging our circumstances in a way that leads us in a specific direction or teaches us important lessons. Although we may not always recognize it at the time, looking back, we can often see how God was working through various situations.<p>God also speaks to us through our consciences. He has given us an innate sense of right and wrong, which helps us discern His will. The apostle Paul writes in <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/1-Timothy/1/1-Timothy-1-5.html>1 Timothy 1:5</a>, "The aim of our charge is love that issues from a pure heart and a good conscience and a sincere faith." Our consciences serve as a moral compass, guiding us in making decisions that align with God's principles.<p><strong>Why This Matters:</strong> Recognizing that God can speak through events and circumstances reminds us that He is actively involved in our lives. It encourages us to trust Him even when things seem uncertain or challenging.</p><iframe allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen frameborder=0 height=315 src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/W65PdAEKfHk width=560></iframe><p><strong>Think About It:</strong> Can you think of a time when you felt that God was speaking to you through a particular event or circumstance? How did it impact your faith or decision-making process?<h3>Conforming Our Minds to Think Like God</h3><p>One of the ways that God speaks to us is by conforming our minds to think like Him. <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/12/Romans-12-2.html>Romans 12:2</a> urges believers, "Do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewal of your mind, that by testing you may discern what is the will of God, what is good and acceptable and perfect." As we grow in our relationship with Him, our thoughts and perspectives should align more closely with His.<p>God allows various events and trials to occur in our lives to shape and mold us spiritually. <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/James/1/James-1-2.html>James 1:2</a>–5 encourages us to consider trials as opportunities for growth: "Count it all joy, my brothers, when you meet trials of various kinds, for you know that the testing of your faith produces steadfastness. And let steadfastness have its full effect, that you may be perfect and complete, lacking in nothing."<p><strong>Why This Matters:</strong> Understanding that God wants to transform our minds helps us develop a biblical worldview and make decisions that align with His will. It reminds us that He is actively involved in our personal growth and sanctification.<p><strong>Think About It:</strong> In what areas of your life do you feel like your thoughts or perspectives need to align more closely with God's? How can you pursue renewing your mind and seeking His will in those areas?<h3>Discernment and Comparing with the Bible</h3><p>While God may still occasionally speak audibly to people today, it is important to exercise discernment and compare any claims of such experiences with what the Bible teaches. Just as there were false prophets and false teachers in biblical times, there are also many voices claiming to speak for God today. Therefore, it is crucial to test everything against the ultimate authority of God's Word.<p>In <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/2-Timothy/3/2-Timothy-3-16.html>2 Timothy 3:16</a>–17, we are reminded that all Scripture is God-breathed and serves as the standard by which we evaluate any claims of divine communication. If someone claims to have heard from God, their words should align with what is taught in the Bible. The Bible is our foundation and guide, providing us with truth, wisdom, and discernment.<p><strong>Why This Matters:</strong> Having a discerning spirit protects us from being led astray by false teachings or misleading claims of divine communication. It helps us stay grounded in the truth of God's Word.<p><strong>Think About It:</strong> Are there any popular teachings or claims of divine communication that you have encountered that seem to contradict or deviate from the teachings of the Bible? How can you guard yourself against being influenced by such teachings?<h3>Conclusion</h3><p>While God may still speak audibly to people today, such instances are exceptions rather than the norm. Instead, God primarily speaks to us through His Word, the Bible. By studying and meditating on His Word, we can hear His voice addressing our hearts and minds. Additionally, God communicates through events and circumstances in our lives, shaping us and guiding us along His path. As we grow in our relationship with Him and renew our minds, we become more attuned to His will and develop a biblical worldview. However, it is crucial that we exercise discernment and compare any claims of divine communication with the teachings of the Bible to ensure they align with God's truth.<p><strong>Why This Matters:</strong> Recognizing that God still speaks today encourages us to seek Him through His Word and be attentive to His guidance in our lives. It deepens our relationship with Him and helps us navigate the complexities of life with confidence.<p><strong>Think About It:</strong> How can you cultivate a deeper sensitivity to hearing God's voice through His Word and in the events of your life? What steps can you take to develop a discerning spirit that aligns with biblical truth?</section><div class=author-info><img alt="Maisha Johnson" class=author-image loading=lazy src=https://biblebasedliving.com/images/profile.png><div class=author-details><h4>Maisha Johnson</h4><p>Written by Maisha Johnson, a dedicated Christian writer known for her inspiring narratives and deep spiritual insights.

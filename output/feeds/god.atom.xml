&lt;p&gt;As Christians, we often wonder if God truly loves us as individuals. It can be challenging to grasp the concept of God's love when we are surrounded by conditional love from finite human beings. We recognize our flaws and shortcomings, and we understand that God is perfect and sinless, making it difficult to comprehend why He would love us. However, the truth of the gospel is that God does love us! Scripture repeatedly reminds us of His love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;God's Intimate Creation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God created humankind in His own image with great care and concern. In Genesis, we see that God formed man from the dust of the ground and breathed life into him. He then created woman from one of man's ribs. This act of creation displays an intimacy between God and humanity that is unique. Unlike the rest of creation, which God spoke into existence, He took time and effort to form and shape us. He entrusted us with dominion over the earth (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/1/Genesis-1-28.html"&gt;Genesis 1:28&lt;/a&gt;) and had direct communication with Adam and Eve. Even after the Fall, when they hid from God in shame, it was not abnormal for them to speak with Him; it was abnormal for them to hide. Despite the broken relationship caused by sin, God's love remained evident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;God's Protective Love&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Adam and Eve sinned, God demonstrated His love through His actions. He made garments of skin to clothe them and protect them from further harm (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/3/Genesis-3-21.html"&gt;Genesis 3:21-23&lt;/a&gt;). This act was not vindictive or punitive; it was an expression of love. God banished them from the Garden of Eden to ensure they would not eat from the tree of life in their fallen state. Even in their disobedience, God acted out of love for their well-being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A Plan of Redemption&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the moment sin entered the world, God had a plan in place for redemption and restoration. Scripture tells us that Jesus was the Lamb slain before the foundation of the world (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-Peter/1/1-Peter-1-20.html"&gt;1 Peter 1:20&lt;/a&gt;). God's love for humankind was so great that He chose to create us, fully aware of the heartache it would cause Him to redeem us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Demonstrations of God's Love&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout the Bible, we find numerous examples of God's love for us. The psalmists, especially David, eloquently express God's love. Psalm 139 is a beautiful reflection on God's intimate knowledge and love for each individual. The Song of Solomon provides a poignant picture of love. Even in the history of the Israelites, we see God's love as He preserves a remnant and pleads with His people to obey and live. God is just, but He is also merciful, tender, and jealous for His people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QPywCD-TSd0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Jesus: The Ultimate Expression of Love&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pinnacle of God's love for humanity is seen in Jesus Christ. God took on human flesh and entered our world to redeem us (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Philippians/2/Philippians-2-5.html"&gt;Philippians 2:5&lt;/a&gt;–11). He was born into an unassuming family in humble circumstances, spending His first night in a manger among animals. Jesus associated with society's outcasts, showed compassion for the sick, healed the broken-hearted, blessed children, and taught us about God's love. In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/13/Luke-13-34.html"&gt;Luke 13:34&lt;/a&gt;, Jesus cried out in anguish over Jerusalem, longing to gather its people under His protective wings. This demonstrates God's desire for a restored relationship with us — not to punish us but to love us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Cross: A Clear Declaration of Love&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ultimate expression of God's love is seen in Jesus' passion and crucifixion. Paul reminds us that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/5/Romans-5-6.html"&gt;Romans 5:6-8&lt;/a&gt;). Jesus' death on the cross was a clear declaration of God's unconditional love. We were in our worst state when Christ died for us, yet He willingly gave Himself up to save us. It is by God's grace, not our own merit, that we are saved (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Ephesians/2/Ephesians-2-1.html"&gt;Ephesians 2:1&lt;/a&gt;, 4-5).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abundant Life Through God's Love&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through Jesus' sacrifice, God made abundant life possible for us. Jesus declared that He came so that we may have life to the full (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/10/John-10-10.html"&gt;John 10:10&lt;/a&gt;). God's love for us is not stingy; He wants to lavish His love upon us. There is no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/8/Romans-8-1.html"&gt;Romans 8:1-2&lt;/a&gt;). Paul, who was once an enemy of Christ, found God's grace and accepted His love. He proclaimed that nothing can separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/8/Romans-8-31.html"&gt;Romans 8:31-32&lt;/a&gt;, 35, 37-39).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding and experiencing God's love is crucial for our faith and relationship with Him. Knowing that God loves us unconditionally transforms our perspective on ourselves, others, and the world around us. It gives us hope, assurance, and a deep sense of belonging. Embracing God's love allows us to live with confidence and joy, knowing that we are secure in His care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Think About It&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take a moment to reflect on God's love for you. Consider the depth of His love as demonstrated through creation, protection, redemption, and the sacrifice of Jesus on the cross. How does knowing that God loves you personally impact your life? How can you respond to His love and show it to others? Spend time in prayer, thanking God for His love and asking Him to help you experience and share it more fully in your daily life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember: Yes! God loves you. As hard as it may be to believe at times, it is the truth. His love for you is unconditional, unfailing, and everlasting.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/God's Relationship to Us/He Cares For Us"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Understanding the Essence of Hashem: A Christian''s Guide</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/meaning-of-hashem/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-09-27T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-09-27T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-09-27:/meaning-of-hashem/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;The Meaning of Hashem&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Hebrew, the word "Hashem" means "The Name." It is used as a substitute for the name of God when reading the Torah or praying. This practice stems from the command in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Exodus/20/Exodus-20-7.html"&gt;Exodus 20:7&lt;/a&gt;, which states, "You shall not misuse the name of the …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;The Meaning of Hashem&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Hebrew, the word "Hashem" means "The Name." It is used as a substitute for the name of God when reading the Torah or praying. This practice stems from the command in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Exodus/20/Exodus-20-7.html"&gt;Exodus 20:7&lt;/a&gt;, which states, "You shall not misuse the name of the LORD your God, for the LORD will not hold anyone guiltless who misuses his name." Jews use Hashem instead of pronouncing the actual name of God, which is transliterated as YHWH. This is done out of reverence and to avoid potentially blaspheming God by misusing His name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Significance of God's Name&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The use of Hashem as a substitute for God's name reflects the deep respect and honor that Jews hold for the name of God. &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Leviticus/22/Leviticus-22-32.html"&gt;Leviticus 22:32&lt;/a&gt; warns against profaning the holy name of God, and the Talmud equates such blasphemy with paganism. The Mishnah even states that those who profane the name of Heaven in secret will face public consequences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1K_0pjxMHyw" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Traditional Jewish Views on Pronouncing God's Name&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Jewish tradition, God's name was allowed to be pronounced only in the Temple in Jerusalem, where the Shechinah (the Divine Presence) resided. The priests were given permission to mention the Explicit Name while blessing the people. Rashi, a respected rabbi, taught that God's name was not to be spoken outside this sacred context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Misconceptions about Pronouncing God's Name&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no biblical reason to use Hashem as a substitute for God's name. In fact, if God did not want us to use His name, He would not have given it to us. However, it is important to remember that using God's name should be done with reverence and respect. As followers of Christ, we should seek to hallow God's name and never use it in an empty, careless, or unworthy manner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the significance of God's name helps us appreciate the reverence and holiness ascribed to it by the Jewish tradition. It reminds us of the importance of honoring God and treating His name with utmost respect. By refraining from misusing His name, we demonstrate our reverence for Him and reflect His character to others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider how you approach the use of God's name in your own life. Are you mindful of speaking His name with reverence and respect? How can you honor God through your words and actions? Reflect on the significance of God's name and how it should guide your behavior as a follower of Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By delving into the meaning of Hashem, we gain a deeper understanding of the Jewish tradition and its reverence for God's name. Let us strive to honor and respect God's name in our own lives, reflecting His character to those around us.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/The Identity of God/The Names of God"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Does God Hate Me? Understanding God's Unconditional Love for You</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/does-god-hate-me/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-09-25T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-09-25T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-09-25:/does-god-hate-me/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Does God Hate Me?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question of whether God hates us is a common one that many people struggle with. It is important to understand that the answer to this question is a resounding "no." As human beings, we have been created in the image of God (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/1/Genesis-1-27.html"&gt;Genesis 1:27 …&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Does God Hate Me?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question of whether God hates us is a common one that many people struggle with. It is important to understand that the answer to this question is a resounding "no." As human beings, we have been created in the image of God (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/1/Genesis-1-27.html"&gt;Genesis 1:27&lt;/a&gt;), and He loves what He has created. However, there are several reasons why some individuals may believe that God hates them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Sin&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the primary reasons people may feel that God hates them is because of their sin. God is perfect, while we as humans are flawed and sinful (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/3/Romans-3-23.html"&gt;Romans 3:23&lt;/a&gt;). Sin creates a barrier between us and God, hindering us from fully reflecting His goodness and likeness. Since the fall of humanity in the Garden of Eden, we have been inclined to rebel against our Creator and assert our own desires (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/3/Genesis-3-1.html"&gt;Genesis 3:1-6&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite our sinful nature, God does not hate us. In fact, He desires for us to be with Him forever. To bridge the gap caused by sin, God entered our world as Jesus Christ, demonstrating His immense love for us (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/3/John-3-16.html"&gt;John 3:16-18&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Philippians/2/Philippians-2-5.html"&gt;Philippians 2:5-11&lt;/a&gt;). Jesus shed His blood to cover our sins, offering salvation to all who believe in Him (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/3/John-3-16.html"&gt;John 3:16&lt;/a&gt;, 36). When we accept Jesus as our Lord and Savior, acknowledging His right to rule over us, God adopts us as His beloved children (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/8/Romans-8-15.html"&gt;Romans 8:15&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Ephesians/1/Ephesians-1-5.html"&gt;Ephesians 1:5&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-John/3/1-John-3-1.html"&gt;1 John 3:1&lt;/a&gt;). As His children, we have the freedom to approach Him at any time, find forgiveness when we make mistakes, and anticipate an eternal life in heaven with Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Flawed Understanding of God&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another reason people may believe that God hates them is due to a skewed understanding of who He truly is. The world is filled with various religious beliefs and teachings, many of which present distorted views of God. Even within Christianity, different denominations may emphasize certain traits of God while excluding others, leading to misconceptions about His nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bible provides us with a clear picture of the character of God. &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/James/4/James-4-7.html"&gt;James 4:7-10&lt;/a&gt; outlines the steps to being accepted into God's presence: submitting to Him, resisting the devil, drawing near to God, purifying our lives, allowing Jesus to cleanse our hearts, and humbling ourselves before God. These actions demonstrate God's longing for us to know Him. By submitting to His authority, obeying His Word, and resisting the temptations of Satan, we can draw near to God and experience His love and acceptance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Pride&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Eq6LECrhCv8" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lack of humility is another factor that can lead people to believe that God hates them. Sometimes when people ask if God hates them, what they truly mean is whether He will accept them while allowing them to continue in their pet sins without change. Scripture is clear that this mindset is incompatible with true repentance and salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we define ourselves by a particular sin and refuse to let go of it, we hinder ourselves from fully accepting the new nature that Jesus provides (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/2-Corinthians/5/2-Corinthians-5-17.html"&gt;2 Corinthians 5:17&lt;/a&gt;). Pride insists on doing things our own way and when God does not conform to our desires, we may conclude that He hates us. However, God's love for us compels Him to insist that we do things His way. Pride was the first sin and corrupted humanity (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/14/Isaiah-14-12.html"&gt;Isaiah 14:12-14&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/3/Genesis-3-5.html"&gt;Genesis 3:5-6&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-John/2/1-John-2-15.html"&gt;1 John 2:15-16&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God does not hate anyone in the sense of unfairly withholding blessings. However, those who persistently choose rebellion against God's plan for their lives will experience the consequences of their choices (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-Samuel/2/1-Samuel-2-30.html"&gt;1 Samuel 2:30&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Malachi/2/Malachi-2-2.html"&gt;Malachi 2:2&lt;/a&gt;). Rejecting God's offer of salvation through Jesus Christ ultimately leads to facing the righteous consequences of our sins (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/7/Matthew-7-13.html"&gt;Matthew 7:13-14&lt;/a&gt;; 25:41; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/3/John-3-36.html"&gt;John 3:36&lt;/a&gt;). This rejection results in an eternity where individuals acknowledge the rightness of their punishment for rejecting the sacrifice made by God's Son on their behalf (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/16/Luke-16-19.html"&gt;Luke 16:19-31&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/10/Hebrews-10-29.html"&gt;Hebrews 10:29&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding that God does not hate us is crucial because it allows us to experience His love and accept His offer of salvation. Recognizing the barriers that sin and pride create in our relationship with God helps us take necessary steps to draw near to Him. Embracing a correct understanding of who God is enables us to know Him more intimately and appreciate His unconditional love for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reflect on your own understanding of God. Are there any misconceptions or false teachings that you have believed? How can you align your beliefs with the truth revealed in the Bible?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consider any areas of pride in your life that may hinder your relationship with God. Are there sins or attitudes that you need to let go of in order to fully submit to His authority?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take time to meditate on the immense love that God has demonstrated through the sacrifice of Jesus Christ. How does this truth impact your perception of His character?&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The concept of the Trinity is a fundamental belief in Christianity.

While this concept may be difficult to fully comprehend, it …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;God the Father&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept of the Trinity is a fundamental belief in Christianity. It teaches that there is one God who exists in three distinct Persons: God the Father, God the Son (Jesus Christ), and God the Holy Spirit. While this concept may be difficult to fully comprehend, it is accepted by faith because it is taught in the Bible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1. The Trinity: One God in Three Persons&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the Bible, there is only one God (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Deuteronomy/6/Deuteronomy-6-4.html"&gt;Deuteronomy 6:4&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-Corinthians/8/1-Corinthians-8-6.html"&gt;1 Corinthians 8:6&lt;/a&gt;). However, this one God exists eternally as three Persons: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/28/Matthew-28-19.html"&gt;Matthew 28:19&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/3/Luke-3-21.html"&gt;Luke 3:21&lt;/a&gt;–22; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/2-Corinthians/13/2-Corinthians-13-14.html"&gt;2 Corinthians 13:14&lt;/a&gt;). Each Person of the Trinity is equal and eternal, with no one being inferior to another (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/1/John-1-1.html"&gt;John 1:1&lt;/a&gt;–2). They share the same essence and nature. The Athanasian Creed expresses it as "In this Trinity, no one is before or after, greater or less than the other; but all three persons are in themselves, coeternal and coequal; and so we must worship the Trinity in unity and the one God in three persons."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Understanding the nature of God as a triune being deepens our appreciation for His complexity and unity. It also helps us grasp the relational aspect of God's existence, with each Person of the Trinity having a distinct role.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; Just as water can exist as a liquid, solid (ice), or gas (steam) while retaining its essential nature as H2O, so too does God exist as three Persons while remaining one God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2. God the Father: The First Person of the Trinity&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God the Father is the first Person of the Trinity and serves as its functional head. While He is an infinite, personal Spirit (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/4/John-4-24.html"&gt;John 4:24&lt;/a&gt;), the term "Father" has been used to identify Him from eternity past. He is referred to as "Father" in relation to His Son (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/3/John-3-16.html"&gt;John 3:16&lt;/a&gt;–17) and His chosen people (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Exodus/4/Exodus-4-22.html"&gt;Exodus 4:22&lt;/a&gt;–23; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-Corinthians/1/1-Corinthians-1-3.html"&gt;1 Corinthians 1:3&lt;/a&gt;). It is important to note that God the Father is neither male nor female, but Scripture uses masculine pronouns to portray His parental closeness and authoritative role as God. Some passages in the Bible also describe God the Father using feminine imagery, which displays His tender care and concern for His people (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/66/Isaiah-66-13.html"&gt;Isaiah 66:13&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/23/Matthew-23-37.html"&gt;Matthew 23:37&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Recognizing God the Father's character and roles helps us approach Him with reverence, gratitude, and trust. It emphasizes His love for us as His children and His desire for an intimate relationship with us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; Just as a loving father provides guidance, protection, and provision for his children, so too does God the Father care for His creation and provide for the needs of His children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;3. The Functional Head of the Trinity&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While God the Father is not superior in essence or being to the Son or the Holy Spirit, He serves as the functional head of the Trinity. Both God the Son and God the Holy Spirit voluntarily submit to Him on a functional level to accomplish the will of God (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/14/John-14-24.html"&gt;John 14:24&lt;/a&gt;–26, 20:21). God the Son is eternally begotten by God the Father and is sent from Him alone (John 17), while God the Holy Spirit proceeds from God the Father through the Son (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/15/John-15-26.html"&gt;John 15:26&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Understanding this functional hierarchy within the Trinity helps us comprehend how each Person of the Trinity works together in unity to fulfill their unique roles in creation, redemption, and sanctification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; Just as a well-coordinated team has a captain who directs the actions of the players, so too does God the Father direct the will of God the Son and God the Holy Spirit to accomplish His purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;4. The Author of All Divine Acts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the functional head of the Trinity, God the Father can be understood as the author of all acts of God. He is the one who created the heavens and the earth (Genesis 1-2), and He did this through God the Son by the power of God the Holy Spirit (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/1/Genesis-1-1.html"&gt;Genesis 1:1&lt;/a&gt;–2; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Colossians/1/Colossians-1-16.html"&gt;Colossians 1:16&lt;/a&gt;). He is also the source for all other divine acts, including election, calling, salvation, sanctification, glorification, and more. &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/11/Romans-11-36.html"&gt;Romans 11:36&lt;/a&gt; says, "For from Him and through Him and to Him are all things. To Him be the glory forever. Amen" (ESV).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Recognizing God the Father as the ultimate source and authority behind all divine acts helps us trust in His sovereignty, wisdom, and goodness. It reminds us that everything exists for His glory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; Just as an architect envisions and designs a building, which is then constructed by contractors and brought to completion according to the architect's plans, so too does God the Father author and oversee all divine acts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;5. Revealed through Jesus Christ&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through His life and ministry, Jesus frequently taught His followers about who God the Father is and what He is like. The Gospel narratives provide us with a clear picture of God the Father. We learn that God is a Father who deeply loves His children (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/16/John-16-27.html"&gt;John 16:27&lt;/a&gt;); He is to be prayed to (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/6/Matthew-6-6.html"&gt;Matthew 6:6&lt;/a&gt;); He is the source of salvation for all who come through Jesus (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/14/John-14-6.html"&gt;John 14:6&lt;/a&gt;); and He has a will that we should seek after (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/6/John-6-38.html"&gt;John 6:38&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Jesus' teachings about God the Father help us understand His character, desires, and intentions. They guide us in our relationship with Him and inform our understanding of the nature of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; Just as a child learns about their father's character, desires, and will through their interactions and conversations, so too do we learn about God the Father through Jesus' teachings and our personal relationship with Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding God the Father as the first Person of the Trinity and the functional head of the Godhead provides us with a deeper comprehension of His roles, character, and relationships within the Trinity. While our understanding may be limited, we can trust in His infinite wisdom, love, and sovereignty. Through Jesus Christ, we can experience a personal relationship with God the Father, approaching Him as a loving Father who desires to be intimately involved in our lives. May we seek to know Him more deeply and honor Him in all that we do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The presence of God is a topic that holds great significance in the Christian faith. In the beginning, Adam and Eve experienced intimate fellowship with God in the Garden of Eden (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/3/Genesis-3-8.html"&gt;Genesis 3:8&lt;/a&gt;). However, sin entered the world and hindered our ability to be in …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;The Presence of God&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The presence of God is a topic that holds great significance in the Christian faith. In the beginning, Adam and Eve experienced intimate fellowship with God in the Garden of Eden (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/3/Genesis-3-8.html"&gt;Genesis 3:8&lt;/a&gt;). However, sin entered the world and hindered our ability to be in the physical presence of God (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Exodus/33/Exodus-33-20.html"&gt;Exodus 33:20&lt;/a&gt;). As a result, only the holy and sinless angels are now in His physical presence (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/1/Luke-1-19.html"&gt;Luke 1:19&lt;/a&gt;). Yet, as Christians, we have the privilege of experiencing the presence of God within us through the indwelling Holy Spirit (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/14/John-14-23.html"&gt;John 14:23&lt;/a&gt;; 15:4). This indwelling presence is made possible through our faith in the Lord Jesus Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Indwelling Presence of God&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/R9qoqQ75ifs" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The presence of God within us is a reality that we become aware of through our obedience to His Word. As believers, we are chosen by God and belong to Him (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-Peter/2/1-Peter-2-9.html"&gt;1 Peter 2:9&lt;/a&gt;). Therefore, it is only natural that He would be present among us. It is important to note that while we may anger God through our sin, true believers never lose the presence of the Holy Spirit. We may, however, lose the "sense" of His presence from time to time. Just as a landlord temporarily leaves his house but leaves his belongings behind, so too does God's presence remain with us even when we feel distant from Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Joy of God's Presence&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The practical result of being in God's presence is joy. Unfortunately, many Christians appear gloomy and dejected due to a lack of this sense of God's presence. However, for those who walk with the Lord in obedience and faith, fellowship with Him is sweet. This sweet fellowship sustains us, especially during trials, for "the joy of the Lord shall be your strength" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Nehemiah/8/Nehemiah-8-10.html"&gt;Nehemiah 8:10&lt;/a&gt;). Trials and difficulties serve to refine our faith and develop perseverance. As we persevere through these challenges, our sense of God's presence increases, along with our joy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the presence of God is essential to our Christian walk. It reminds us that we are not alone but rather have the indwelling Holy Spirit guiding and empowering us. Knowing that God is always present with us can bring comfort and assurance, even in the midst of trials. It also encourages us to seek obedience, trusting that as we do, our sense of His presence will grow, leading to greater joy in our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does knowing that God is always present with you impact your daily life?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have you ever experienced a time when you felt distant from God's presence? How did you regain a sense of His nearness?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reflect on a difficult situation you have faced. Did your sense of God's presence increase or decrease during that time? How did it impact your faith and perseverance?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, the presence of God is a reality that Christians experience through the indwelling Holy Spirit. Though sin has separated us from God's physical presence, we can still enjoy fellowship with Him by walking in obedience and faith. The joy that comes from being in God's presence sustains us through trials and strengthens our faith. Remembering that God is always present with us can bring comfort, assurance, and a greater sense of joy in our lives.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/Our Response to God/Knowing God"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Unveiling the Dangers of Blind Faith in Christianity: A Comprehensive Guide</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/blind-faith/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-09-24T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-09-24T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-09-24:/blind-faith/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Blind Faith: Understanding True Faith in God&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Faith is a concept that holds great significance in Christianity. It is often associated with the idea of "blind faith," which refers to belief without true understanding or discrimination. However, is this the kind of faith that God desires us to have? Does God expect us to have a blind faith? To answer these questions, we will explore the topic of blind faith in the context of biblical teachings and examples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Example of Abraham's Faith&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most prominent examples of faith in the Old Testament is that of Abraham. God made a promise to Abraham that he would become the father of many nations, even though he and his wife Sarah were very old. In their old age, Sarah miraculously gave birth to their son Isaac. Then, God asked Abraham to offer Isaac as a sacrifice (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/22/Genesis-22-1.html"&gt;Genesis 22:1-19&lt;/a&gt;). Astonishingly, Abraham obeyed without questioning God's command. This incident might suggest that God commends blind faith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, if we delve deeper into the biblical account, we find a different perspective on Abraham's faith. In the book of Hebrews, Abraham's faith is described as a reasoned faith. Hebrews 11, often referred to as the hall of fame of faith, mentions Abraham multiple times. In verses 18-19, it states that Abraham "reasoned" that God had promised a great nation through Isaac and believed that even if Isaac were killed, God could raise him from the dead. Abraham's actions were not blind; they were based on reasoning and understanding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Importance of Reason and Understanding&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout Scripture, reason, wisdom, and logic are emphasized as valuable traits. &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Proverbs/3/Proverbs-3-13.html"&gt;Proverbs 3:13&lt;/a&gt; tells us that we are blessed when we gain knowledge and understanding. &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/5/Hebrews-5-12.html"&gt;Hebrews 5:12-14&lt;/a&gt; reproves those who do not seek growth in understanding. The Bereans in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Acts/17/Acts-17-11.html"&gt;Acts 17:11&lt;/a&gt; were commended for their diligent search of the Scriptures to verify the truth of Paul's teachings. The apostle Paul himself often used reason and logical arguments to persuade others of the truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God has given us the ability to think and reason, and He expects us to use this gift. The goal of reason and logic is to find truth, and Jesus, who claimed to be the truth (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/14/John-14-6.html"&gt;John 14:6&lt;/a&gt;), should be the ultimate destination of our reasoning. Therefore, our faith should not be blind; it should be based on knowledge of God's nature, His promises in Scripture, and our personal experience walking with Him every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uwNvdEV9720" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Nurturing a Reasoned Faith&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we are called to have a reasoned faith, there may be times when we have to act purely on faith without having the complete picture, just as Abraham did. However, even in such situations, our faith is not blind but based on what we know about God and His character. Abraham's faith was rooted in his lifetime of walking with God and experiencing His faithfulness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To nurture a reasoned faith, we can engage in various practices. First and foremost, studying the Scriptures is essential. By immersing ourselves in God's Word, we gain a deeper understanding of His nature and His promises. We can also seek wisdom through prayer, asking God for insight and understanding (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/James/1/James-1-5.html"&gt;James 1:5&lt;/a&gt;). Additionally, engaging in conversations with fellow believers and learning from their experiences can help us grow in our faith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the nature of faith is crucial because it shapes our relationship with God. If we view faith as blind belief without understanding, we may struggle to reconcile our doubts and questions with our desire to follow God. However, by embracing a reasoned faith, we can find assurance in knowing that God wants us to use our minds and hearts to seek Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reasoned faith also helps us navigate challenges and trials. When we encounter difficulties, our understanding of God's character and promises can provide us with the strength and hope to persevere. It allows us to approach God with confidence, knowing that He is faithful and trustworthy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How do you define faith? Does the concept of "blind faith" align with your understanding of faith?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reflect on Abraham's example of faith. How can you apply the principles of reasoned faith to your own life?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consider the role of reason and understanding in your relationship with God. How can you cultivate a deeper understanding of His nature and promises?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, blind faith is not the kind of faith that God desires from us. Instead, God calls us to have a reasoned faith based on our knowledge and understanding of Him. While there may be times when we have to act purely on faith without complete understanding, our faith is grounded in what we know about God's character, His promises in Scripture, and our personal experiences walking with Him. By embracing a reasoned faith, we can deepen our relationship with God and find strength in difficult times.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/Our Response to God/Seeking God"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Exploring the Divine: Unveiling the Second Person of the Trinity</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/second-person-of-the-trinity/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-09-24T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-09-24T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-09-24:/second-person-of-the-trinity/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Second Person of the Trinity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept of the Trinity refers to the belief that there is one God who exists in three distinct persons. The Bible teaches that these three persons, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, are coexistent and co-eternal. Jesus is considered the second person …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Second Person of the Trinity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept of the Trinity refers to the belief that there is one God who exists in three distinct persons. The Bible teaches that these three persons, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, are coexistent and co-eternal. Jesus is considered the second person of the Trinity because he is mentioned second in the "Trinitarian formula" found in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/28/Matthew-28-19.html"&gt;Matthew 28:19&lt;/a&gt;. This formula is used in the Great Commission, where Jesus instructs his disciples to baptize new believers "in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to note that using terms like first, second, and third when referring to the persons of the Trinity does not imply a difference in their importance. The Athanasian Creed, an early summary of Christian doctrine on the Trinity, emphasizes that while there are three distinct persons, they share the same nature and substance. The creed states, "There is one Person of the Father, another of the Son, and another of the Holy Spirit. But the godhead of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, is all one, the glory equal, the majesty co-eternal... In the Trinity none is before or after another; none is greater or less than another, but all three Persons are co-eternal together and co-equal."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although Jesus is not inferior to the Father, he willingly submitted himself to the Father's will. He is called the second person of the Trinity because he took on human nature and lived in total obedience to God the Father. &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Philippians/2/Philippians-2-6.html"&gt;Philippians 2:6-8&lt;/a&gt; describes this submission: "Who, being in very nature God, did not consider equality with God something to be used to his own advantage; rather, he made himself nothing by taking the very nature of a servant, being made in human likeness. And being found in appearance as a man, he humbled himself by becoming obedient to death—even death on a cross!" In the "economic Trinity," which refers to how God has revealed himself and interacts with humanity, Jesus holds a second position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VM2UE6MIKzM" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through his obedience as the Son, Jesus accomplished our salvation and is now exalted at the right hand of the Father. &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/1/Hebrews-1-3.html"&gt;Hebrews 1:3&lt;/a&gt; affirms this: "The Son is the radiance of God’s glory and the exact representation of his being, sustaining all things by his powerful word. After he had provided purification for sins, he sat down at the right hand of the Majesty in heaven."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the concept of the second person of the Trinity is essential to grasp the fullness of God's revelation and his plan of salvation. By recognizing Jesus as the second person in the Trinity, we acknowledge his divine nature and his role in our redemption. It also helps us appreciate the depth of his humility and obedience in taking on human form and submitting to God's will. Recognizing Jesus' exaltation to the right hand of the Father reminds us of his authority and power over all things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider the significance of Jesus willingly submitting himself to God's plan of salvation. How does this act of humility impact your understanding of who Jesus is and what he has done for you? How does recognizing Jesus as the second person of the Trinity shape your perspective on his authority and role in your life? Take a moment to reflect on these truths and thank God for sending Jesus to redeem you.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/The Nature of God/The Trinity"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Why Does God Ask Questions: Revealing the Divine Purpose</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/why-does-god-ask-questions/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-09-21T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-09-21T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-09-21:/why-does-god-ask-questions/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Why Does God Ask Questions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

This may seem puzzling, but when we examine these questions closely, we can see that they serve a purpose beyond obtaining information. The questions God asks …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Why Does God Ask Questions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Bible, we see instances where God asks questions, even though He is omniscient and knows everything. This may seem puzzling, but when we examine these questions closely, we can see that they serve a purpose beyond obtaining information. The questions God asks vary based on the context and the needs of the individuals involved. Let's explore why God asks questions and how it reveals His character and intentions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1. Drawing Out and Reconciliation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Adam and Eve ate the forbidden fruit in the Garden of Eden, they hid themselves from God. In response, God called out to Adam, "Where are you?" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/3/Genesis-3-9.html"&gt;Genesis 3:9&lt;/a&gt;). Although God knew their physical location, His question was designed to draw Adam out of hiding. Instead of approaching His sinful creation in anger and judgment, God showed His grace, gentleness, and desire for reconciliation by asking this question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; This question highlights God's loving nature and His desire to restore broken relationships. It shows that even when we try to hide from Him due to our sin or shame, He seeks us out and invites us into reconciliation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; How does knowing that God actively seeks reconciliation with us impact your understanding of His love and grace?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2. Focus and Instruction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as a teacher might ask a student a question to focus their thinking on a specific problem, God asks questions to direct our attention to important matters. For example, when Moses encountered God at the burning bush, God asked him, "What is that in your hand?" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Exodus/4/Exodus-4-2.html"&gt;Exodus 4:2&lt;/a&gt;). God already knew that Moses was holding a staff, but this question served to focus Moses' attention on the staff as a tool through which God would perform miracles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; God's questions serve as instructional tools that guide us toward important truths and help us focus on what He wants to reveal to us. They encourage us to think deeply and engage with His teachings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; How can God's questions in Scripture help you focus on what He wants to teach you personally?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;3. Emphasizing God's Power and Sovereignty&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the book of Job, God questions Job relentlessly about various aspects of creation and His own power and sovereignty. These questions are not meant to obtain information but rather to emphasize God's limitless wisdom and authority. For example, God asks Job about his absence when the foundations of the earth were set (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Job/38/Job-38-4.html"&gt;Job 38:4&lt;/a&gt;) and his inability to contend with sea monsters (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Job/41/Job-41-1.html"&gt;Job 41:1&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; God's questions in Job remind us of His vast knowledge and power. They humble us and help us recognize our limited understanding compared to His infinite wisdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; How does reflecting on God's questions in Job deepen your awe and reverence for His sovereignty?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;4. Prompting Self-Examination&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God's questions often have the purpose of prompting introspection and self-examination. When Jonah became angry because of God's compassion towards the people of Nineveh, God asked him, "Is it right for you to be angry?" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Jonah/4/Jonah-4-4.html"&gt;Jonah 4:4&lt;/a&gt;, 9). This question encouraged Jonah to reflect on his own heart and motives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; God's questions challenge us to examine our attitudes, actions, and motives. They invite us to grow in self-awareness and humility before Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; How can God's questions help you examine your own heart and align your attitudes with His?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/T2zbKpETVMs" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;5. Probing Faith and Understanding&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During Jesus' ministry on earth, He often asked questions that probed people's faith, understanding, and commitment. Jesus used strategic questions as a teaching tool, just as a skilled teacher does. For example, Jesus asked His disciples, "Who do people say I am?" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/8/Mark-8-27.html"&gt;Mark 8:27&lt;/a&gt;) to prompt them to think about His identity and deepen their faith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Jesus' questions challenge us to examine our own faith, understanding, and commitment to Him. They invite us to go deeper in our relationship with Him and discover more about who He truly is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; How can Jesus' questions in the Gospels deepen your understanding of His identity and strengthen your faith in Him?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;6. Encouraging Volunteering and Obedience&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God's questions can also prompt individuals to volunteer for His purposes or evaluate their obedience. When Isaiah witnessed a vision of God's glory, God asked, "Whom shall I send? And who will go for us?" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/6/Isaiah-6-8.html"&gt;Isaiah 6:8&lt;/a&gt;). This question prompted Isaiah to volunteer himself for God's mission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; God's questions invite us to actively participate in His purposes and evaluate our willingness to obey His calling. They remind us that He desires our wholehearted involvement in His work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; How does God's question to Isaiah challenge you to volunteer for His purposes and evaluate your obedience?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God's questions serve various purposes. They can draw us out of hiding, provide instruction, emphasize God's power, prompt self-examination, probe our faith, and encourage volunteering and obedience. These questions reveal God's loving nature, His desire for reconciliation, and His commitment to teaching us within the context of a relationship. When God asks a question, it is not because He lacks knowledge but because He wants us to know and grow in understanding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we engage with the questions God asks in Scripture, let us open our hearts and minds to receive His wisdom, guidance, and transformation. May we respond to His questions with humility, obedience, and a desire to know Him more deeply.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/God's Relationship to Us/Father-God"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Redeeming Bad Things in Good People: A Christian Perspective</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/bad-things-good-people/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-09-20T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-09-20T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-09-20:/bad-things-good-people/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Bad Things Happening to Good People: Why Does It Happen?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We live in a world filled with pain and suffering. It is a reality that affects everyone, and one of the most difficult questions in theology is why bad things happen to good people. As humans, we are limited in our understanding of God's purposes and ways. We cannot fully comprehend His plans as we are not eternal, infinite, or omniscient like Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Example of Job&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book of Job in the Bible deals with the issue of why God allows bad things to happen to good people. Job was a righteous man who suffered immensely. God allowed Satan to afflict Job with unimaginable pain and loss, except for taking his life. Despite his suffering, Job maintained his trust in God, saying, "Though he slay me, yet will I hope in him" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Job/13/Job-13-15.html"&gt;Job 13:15&lt;/a&gt;). He acknowledged that even though he didn't understand why God allowed these things to happen, he knew that God was good and worthy of his trust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Reality of Sin&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When pondering why bad things happen to good people, it is essential to consider that there are no truly "good" people in an absolute sense. All of us are tainted by sin (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Ecclesiastes/7/Ecclesiastes-7-20.html"&gt;Ecclesiastes 7:20&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/3/Romans-3-23.html"&gt;Romans 3:23&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-John/1/1-John-1-8.html"&gt;1 John 1:8&lt;/a&gt;). Jesus Himself said, "No one is good—except God alone" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/18/Luke-18-19.html"&gt;Luke 18:19&lt;/a&gt;). We all experience the consequences of sin, whether it's our own personal sin or the sins committed by others. We live in a fallen world where injustice and seemingly senseless suffering exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Four Perspectives on Bad Things Happening&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eternal Perspective:&lt;/strong&gt; Although bad things may happen to good people in this world, we must remember that this world is not the end. As Christians, we have an eternal perspective. Our present troubles are temporary, and we look forward to the eternal glory awaiting us (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/2-Corinthians/4/2-Corinthians-4-16.html"&gt;2 Corinthians 4:16&lt;/a&gt;–18). We have the assurance that there will be a reward for our faithfulness, and it will be glorious.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Maintaining an eternal perspective helps us endure present suffering and find hope in the midst of trials. It reminds us that our ultimate home is in heaven, where there will be no more pain or suffering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; How does knowing that our present troubles are temporary change our perspective on the challenges we face?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;God's Ultimate Good:&lt;/strong&gt; Although bad things happen to good people, God can use those very things for an ultimate and lasting good (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/8/Romans-8-28.html"&gt;Romans 8:28&lt;/a&gt;). The story of Joseph in the Bible illustrates this truth. Joseph, innocent of any wrongdoing, endured immense suffering but eventually saw God's good plan unfold (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/50/Genesis-50-19.html"&gt;Genesis 50:19&lt;/a&gt;–21).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Recognizing that God can bring good out of even the most painful circumstances gives us hope and assurance. We can trust that He is working all things together for our good, even when we cannot see the bigger picture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; Can you think of a time when you experienced something difficult but later realized how it led to something positive in your life?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AndXsPdvHCM" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deeper Ministry:&lt;/strong&gt; Bad things happening to good people can equip believers for deeper ministry. As we experience God's comfort and healing in our own troubles, we are better able to comfort others going through similar situations (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/2-Corinthians/1/2-Corinthians-1-3.html"&gt;2 Corinthians 1:3&lt;/a&gt;–5). Our own experiences of suffering allow us to empathize with and support those who are hurting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Our personal experiences of pain and suffering can become sources of strength and encouragement for others. God can use our trials to bring comfort and healing to those who need it most.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; How have you been able to support or encourage someone going through a difficult time based on your own experiences?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jesus' Example:&lt;/strong&gt; The worst things happened to the best Person—Jesus Christ. He was the only truly righteous One, yet He suffered more than we can imagine. Jesus' suffering and death on the cross demonstrate His love for us and provide an example for us to follow (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-Peter/2/1-Peter-2-20.html"&gt;1 Peter 2:20&lt;/a&gt;–23). He entrusted Himself to God, even in the midst of great suffering.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Jesus' suffering shows us that we are not alone in our pain. He understands our struggles and is with us every step of the way. We can find comfort and strength in knowing that Jesus has faced the worst of human suffering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; How does Jesus' example of enduring suffering without retaliation inspire you in your own struggles?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Trusting in God's Goodness&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, we may never fully understand why bad things happen to good people in this fallen world. Yet, as Christians, we can trust in the goodness, justice, love, and mercy of God (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/135/Psalm-135-3.html"&gt;Psalm 135:3&lt;/a&gt;). It is important to remember that God is working all things according to His purposes, even when His ways are beyond our comprehension.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When faced with trials and suffering, we are called to trust in the Lord with all our hearts and lean not on our own understanding (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Proverbs/3/Proverbs-3-5.html"&gt;Proverbs 3:5&lt;/a&gt;–6). We walk by faith, not by sight. While we may not always understand why certain things happen, we can find comfort in knowing that God is always with us, even in the darkest moments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Trusting in God's goodness and sovereignty allows us to find peace and hope amidst life's difficulties. It anchors us in times of uncertainty and strengthens our faith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; How can you cultivate a deeper trust in God's goodness and sovereignty, even when faced with difficult circumstances?&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/God and Evil/Hardships"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Why Do Christians Suffer: Unveiling the Purpose Behind Pain</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/why-do-christians-suffer/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-09-18T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-09-18T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-09-18:/why-do-christians-suffer/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Why Do Christians Suffer?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suffering is an inevitable part of the Christian life. Jesus Himself warned His followers that they would face trouble in this world (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/16/John-16-33.html"&gt;John 16:33&lt;/a&gt;). However, Christians have a unique perspective on suffering, and there are several reasons why they may experience it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1. The Brokenness …&lt;/h3&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Why Do Christians Suffer?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suffering is an inevitable part of the Christian life. Jesus Himself warned His followers that they would face trouble in this world (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/16/John-16-33.html"&gt;John 16:33&lt;/a&gt;). However, Christians have a unique perspective on suffering, and there are several reasons why they may experience it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1. The Brokenness of the World&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One reason why Christians suffer is because they live in a broken and fallen world. When God originally created everything, it was "very good" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/1/Genesis-1-31.html"&gt;Genesis 1:31&lt;/a&gt;). However, sin entered the world through Adam's disobedience, and its effects continue to corrupt the world today (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/3/Romans-3-23.html"&gt;Romans 3:23&lt;/a&gt;; 6:23; 8:19–23). As a result, both Christians and non-Christians alike experience the difficulties and hardships of life on this broken planet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2. Non-Conformity to the World&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christians may also suffer because they stand for an uncompromising truth that the world often rejects. Jesus said, "If the world hates you, keep in mind that it hated me first" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/15/John-15-18.html"&gt;John 15:18&lt;/a&gt;). Believers represent the exclusive truth that Jesus Christ is the only way to God (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/14/John-14-6.html"&gt;John 14:6&lt;/a&gt;), which can be challenging for a world that promotes relativism and tolerance of all beliefs. This rejection can lead to various forms of suffering for Christians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;3. Refinement and Spiritual Growth&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One purpose of suffering for Christians is to refine their faith and character. The apostle Peter writes to encourage suffering Christians, saying that their trials test the genuineness of their faith, which is more valuable than gold (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-Peter/1/1-Peter-1-6.html"&gt;1 Peter 1:6-7&lt;/a&gt;). Similarly, James tells us to consider it pure joy when we face trials because they produce perseverance, maturity, and completeness in our faith (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/James/1/James-1-2.html"&gt;James 1:2&lt;/a&gt;–4). Through suffering, God can use temporary hardships to develop and strengthen His children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/b3ejvXVI_Kc" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;4. Discipline and Correction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, suffering can be a form of discipline from God. Just as a loving father disciplines his children, God disciplines those He loves (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/12/Hebrews-12-5.html"&gt;Hebrews 12:5&lt;/a&gt;–11). This discipline is not meant to harm or punish, but rather to correct and guide His children back onto the right path. It may involve allowing hardships or consequences to help believers readjust their priorities and turn their hearts back to Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;5. Comforting Others&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christians who have experienced suffering themselves are better equipped to empathize with and comfort others who are suffering. The apostle Paul writes that God comforts us in all our troubles so that we can comfort others with the same comfort we have received from Him (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/2-Corinthians/1/2-Corinthians-1-3.html"&gt;2 Corinthians 1:3&lt;/a&gt;–4). When believers go through trials, they can draw on their own experiences to offer support and encouragement to others who are facing similar challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;6. Drawing Closer to God&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suffering has a way of stripping away the temporal securities of this world and drawing Christians closer to the Lord. When everything else fails, believers are forced to seek solace, peace, and purpose in God's Word. It is during times of suffering that many Christians experience a deeper intimacy with God as they rely on Him for strength and find comfort in His presence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;7. Longing for Eternity&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suffering also reminds Christians that this world is not their ultimate home. While those in more affluent parts of the world may find it harder to long for heaven, Christians who suffer persecution, poverty, and privation often have a greater desire for eternity. When life is comfortable, the eternal perspective may fade into the background, but suffering can serve as a reminder that our hope lies not in this world but in God's greater plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding why Christians suffer is important because it helps believers navigate the challenges and hardships they encounter in life. By grasping the biblical perspective on suffering, Christians can find comfort, hope, and purpose in the midst of their trials. It also equips them to minister to others who are going through similar difficulties, offering them encouragement and pointing them to the hope found in Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does knowing that suffering is a part of the Christian life change your perspective on your own trials and hardships?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In what ways can you use your experiences of suffering to comfort and encourage others?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does the knowledge that this world is not our ultimate home impact your priorities and desires?&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On September 11, 2001, our world was forever changed by the tragic events that unfolded. Many people asked the question: Where was God in the midst of this terrible tragedy? As Christians, we believe that God is always present and in control, even in the face of evil and suffering. While it may be difficult to comprehend why a loving God would allow such a tragedy to happen, we must remember that God's ways are higher than our ways and His thoughts are higher than our thoughts (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/55/Isaiah-55-9.html"&gt;Isaiah 55:9&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Reality of Human Sinfulness&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To understand why God allows evil and suffering in our world, we must first acknowledge the reality of human sinfulness. The Bible tells us that all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/3/Romans-3-23.html"&gt;Romans 3:23&lt;/a&gt;). Humanity is desperately wicked and sinful (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/3/Romans-3-10.html"&gt;Romans 3:10-18&lt;/a&gt;). God allows human beings to commit sin for His own reasons and to fulfill His own purposes. This does not mean that God is responsible for the wicked acts of evil men.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;God's Eternal Perspective&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God looks at things from an eternal perspective, while we often view things from an earthly perspective. We may wonder why God allowed Adam and Eve to sin and bring evil, death, and suffering upon all mankind. However, it is important to remember that the purpose of all creation and all creatures is to glorify God. God is glorified when His nature and attributes are displayed. If there were no sin, God would have no opportunity to display His justice and wrath as He punishes sin. Nor would He have the opportunity to show His grace, mercy, and love to undeserving creatures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ultimate display of God's grace was seen at the Cross, where Jesus died for our sins. Here, unselfishness and obedience were displayed in God's Son, who knew no sin but was made sin for us so that we might become the righteousness of God in Him (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/2-Corinthians/5/2-Corinthians-5-21.html"&gt;2 Corinthians 5:21&lt;/a&gt;). This was all to the praise of His glory (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Ephesians/1/Ephesians-1-14.html"&gt;Ephesians 1:14&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Recognizing the Miracles Amidst Tragedy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When reflecting on September 11, it is easy to focus solely on the tragedy and forget the miracles that occurred that day. Despite the devastation, there were countless instances where lives were saved and people were able to escape just in time. These miracles remind us that God was present even amidst the chaos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, a small group of firemen and one civilian survived in a tiny stairwell as one of the towers collapsed around them. The passengers on Flight 93 fought against the terrorists, preventing further destruction. These are just a few examples of the numerous miracles that took place that day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tpBLlbzE2xg" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding God's sovereignty and purpose in the midst of tragedy is crucial for our faith. It reminds us that God is always in control, even when things seem out of control. Moreover, it helps us trust in His wisdom and goodness, even when we cannot fully comprehend His ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we reflect on September 11, let us not only remember the tragedy but also the stories of hope and resilience. Let us be reminded of the countless lives that have been changed for the better since that day. It is possible that many people have turned to Christ and found salvation as a result of what happened. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When faced with difficult circumstances or tragedies in our own lives, may we find comfort in knowing that God is with us. Let us trust in His sovereignty and have faith that He works all things together for good to those who love Him and are called according to His purpose (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/8/Romans-8-28.html"&gt;Romans 8:28&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/God and Evil/War and Disasters"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Does God Truly Love Satan?

&lt;p&gt;The question of whether God loves Satan is a complex and profound one. As Christians, it is important for us to understand the nature of both God and Satan in order to grasp the depth of this issue. The Bible provides us with insights into the character of both God and Satan, allowing us to discern their relationship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Satan: The Embodiment of Evil&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Satan, also known as the devil, is portrayed in the Bible as the enemy of God and humanity. He is described as the evil one (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/6/Matthew-6-13.html"&gt;Matthew 6:13&lt;/a&gt;), the father of lies and a murderer (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/8/John-8-44.html"&gt;John 8:44&lt;/a&gt;), and the accuser of God's people (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Revelation/12/Revelation-12-10.html"&gt;Revelation 12:10&lt;/a&gt;). Additionally, he is characterized as a tempter (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-Thessalonians/3/1-Thessalonians-3-5.html"&gt;1 Thessalonians 3:5&lt;/a&gt;), proud, wicked, and violent (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/14/Isaiah-14-12.html"&gt;Isaiah 14:12-15&lt;/a&gt;), a deceiver (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Acts/13/Acts-13-10.html"&gt;Acts 13:10&lt;/a&gt;), a schemer (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Ephesians/6/Ephesians-6-11.html"&gt;Ephesians 6:11&lt;/a&gt;), and a thief (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/8/Luke-8-12.html"&gt;Luke 8:12&lt;/a&gt;). In essence, Satan embodies everything that is evil and unholy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;God's Nature: Holy and Just&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast to Satan's evil nature, God is holy and just. The Bible teaches us that God cannot love that which is evil and unholy (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/5/Psalm-5-4.html"&gt;Psalm 5:4&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Habakkuk/1/Habakkuk-1-13.html"&gt;Habakkuk 1:13&lt;/a&gt;). His perfect holiness and righteousness are incompatible with sin. Therefore, it is not possible for God to love Satan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Love for Enemies&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus taught us to love our enemies (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/5/Matthew-5-44.html"&gt;Matthew 5:44&lt;/a&gt;), but this command pertains to our relationships with other human beings. We are called to love all people because they are created in the image of God. However, angels, including Satan, were not created in God's image. Consequently, we are never instructed to love or have affection for angels, whether holy or fallen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Nature of Love and Holiness&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9fiz4VPTJGE" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To fully comprehend why God cannot love Satan, we must understand the nature of love and holiness. Love is not just an emotion but a choice to act in the best interest of another. It is rooted in God's character and expressed through His sacrificial love for us (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/3/John-3-16.html"&gt;John 3:16&lt;/a&gt;). Holiness, on the other hand, refers to God's complete separation from sin and evil. God's love and holiness are intertwined, and they work together in perfect harmony.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we were to love Satan, we would be forced to hate God because holiness is the opposite of sin. Satan's very existence stands in opposition to everything that God loves and values. Therefore, it is not possible for us to love Satan without compromising our love for God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;God's Judgment of Satan&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God has already determined that there will be no forgiveness for Satan (Revelation 20). We, as humans, are the objects of God's sacrificial love, as demonstrated through the cross. While redeeming mankind, God simultaneously put Satan "to open shame" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Colossians/2/Colossians-2-15.html"&gt;Colossians 2:15&lt;/a&gt;). This judgment of Satan is an integral part of God's great love for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding why God does not love Satan has significant implications for our faith. It reminds us of the profound difference between good and evil and reinforces our trust in God's justice. Recognizing Satan's true nature helps us guard against his deceitful tactics and remain steadfast in our commitment to follow God. Furthermore, it deepens our appreciation for the sacrificial love that God has shown us through Jesus Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider the following points as you reflect on this topic:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does understanding Satan's true nature impact your perception of evil?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What does it mean for you personally that God loves you despite your own sinful nature?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can knowing that God's love and holiness are inseparable affect your own pursuit of holiness?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we grapple with the question of whether God loves Satan, we must remember that God's love and holiness are intertwined. While God loves us unconditionally, He cannot love that which is evil and unholy. Recognizing Satan's true nature helps us understand the depth of God's love for us and reinforces our commitment to follow Him.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/God and Evil/The Existence of Sin and Evil"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Encountering the Divine: 7 Transformative Ways Christians Have Seen God</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/seen-god/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-09-16T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-09-16T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-09-16:/seen-god/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Seeing God: A Biblical Perspective&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Christians, we often wonder what it would be like to see God. The Bible provides us with several accounts of individuals who had encounters with God or His divine messengers. However, it is important to note that seeing God in His full glory is beyond our human capacity. In this article, we will explore some biblical examples of people who had encounters with God, understand the limitations of seeing God, and discover how Jesus Christ serves as our ultimate connection to God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Jacob's Wrestling Match with God&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the book of Genesis, we read about Jacob's encounter with a divine being. Jacob wrestles with this mysterious figure throughout the night. After the encounter, Jacob realizes that he has wrestled with God Himself and exclaims, "I have seen God face to face, and yet my life has been delivered" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/32/Genesis-32-30.html"&gt;Genesis 32:30&lt;/a&gt; ESV). However, it is important to note that Jacob did not see God in all His glory or in His true spiritual form. Instead, he encountered a theophany - a manifestation of God in human form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Samson's Parents and the Angel of the Lord&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another example of an encounter with God is found in the book of Judges. Samson's parents have an interaction with the angel of the Lord. At first, they do not realize they are speaking to a divine messenger. However, when the angel performs a sign and ascends to heaven before their eyes, Samson's father is terrified and exclaims, "We are doomed to die! We have seen God!" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Judges/13/Judges-13-22.html"&gt;Judges 13:22&lt;/a&gt; ESV). Similar to Jacob's experience, they had only seen God appearing as an angel - a theophany or Christophany.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Isaiah's Vision of the Lord&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4u4mgwVj13I" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/6/Isaiah-6-1.html"&gt;Isaiah 6:1-13&lt;/a&gt;, the prophet Isaiah has a vision of "the Lord, high and lifted up" seated on a throne. Isaiah witnesses the presence of seraphim, who cover their faces in God's presence. Overwhelmed by his own sinfulness, Isaiah cries out, "Woe is me! For I am lost; for I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips; for my eyes have seen the King, the Lord of hosts!" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/6/Isaiah-6-5.html"&gt;Isaiah 6:5&lt;/a&gt; ESV). However, it is essential to understand that Isaiah experiences a prophetic vision. He sees a symbol of God's presence and majesty rather than God Himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Limitations of Seeing God&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bible makes it clear that no one has ever seen God in His true spiritual form. In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/1/John-1-18.html"&gt;John 1:18&lt;/a&gt;, we read, "No one has ever seen God." This statement emphasizes the spiritual nature of God. God is spirit (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/4/John-4-24.html"&gt;John 4:24&lt;/a&gt;) and cannot be fully perceived by our physical eyes. The limitations of our physical, moral, and spiritual nature prevent us from beholding God's glory and essence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moses had a unique relationship with God. He spoke with God "face to face" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Exodus/33/Exodus-33-11.html"&gt;Exodus 33:11&lt;/a&gt;) and witnessed His glory in various encounters. However, even Moses was unable to see God in all His fullness. When Moses asked to see God's glory, God responded, "You cannot see my face, for man shall not see me and live" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Exodus/33/Exodus-33-20.html"&gt;Exodus 33:20&lt;/a&gt; ESV). Moses was granted a glimpse of God's glory but was shielded from seeing the fullness of His divine essence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Seeing God Through Jesus Christ&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we may be limited in our ability to see God directly, we can still know Him through His Son, Jesus Christ. Jesus is described as the unique case of someone who has seen God. In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/3/John-3-13.html"&gt;John 3:13&lt;/a&gt;, Jesus says, "No one has ascended into heaven except he who descended from heaven, the Son of Man." Jesus, being both the Son of Man and the Son of God, has a profound understanding of both the earthly and heavenly realms. He is the embodiment of all God is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/1/John-1-18.html"&gt;John 1:18&lt;/a&gt;, we are told, "No one has ever seen God; the only God, who is at the Father's side, he has made him known." Jesus, as the one and only Son of God, has made God known to us. Through His life, teachings, death, and resurrection, Jesus reveals the character and nature of God. When Philip asks Jesus to show them the Father, Jesus responds, "Whoever has seen me has seen the Father" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/14/John-14-9.html"&gt;John 14:9&lt;/a&gt; ESV). Jesus serves as our connection to God. He is God in human form, clothed in humanity so that we can comprehend and relate to Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the limitations of seeing God helps us grasp the significance of Jesus Christ as our mediator. In our fallen state, we are separated from God by sin. However, through His sacrificial death on the cross, Jesus provides us with a way to reconcile with God. He bridges the gap between humanity and divinity. By placing our faith in Jesus and accepting Him as our Lord and Savior, we can experience a personal relationship with God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it is natural for us to desire to see God visually, it is important to recognize that our limited human perception cannot fully comprehend His glory. Instead of focusing on physically seeing God, we should strive to know Him through Jesus Christ. As we study His Word, pray, and seek His presence in our lives, we deepen our understanding of who He is and grow in our relationship with Him. Let us fix our eyes on Jesus, who reveals the Father to us and leads us into a deeper understanding of God's love, grace, and truth.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/God's Relationship to Us/Toward All People"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Revealing the Majesty: King of Glory Unveiled in Scripture</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/king-of-glory/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-09-14T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-09-14T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-09-14:/king-of-glory/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;King of Glory: The Majesty of God&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the book of Psalms, we find a series of verses that refer to the "King of glory." These verses, found in Psalm 24, convey a sense of awe and reverence for God. They invite us to consider the magnitude and power of our Creator. Let's explore this concept and its significance in our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The King of Glory Revealed&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/24/Psalm-24-7.html"&gt;Psalm 24:7-10&lt;/a&gt; says, "Lift up your heads, you gates; be lifted up, you ancient doors, that the King of glory may come in. Who is this King of glory? The Lord strong and mighty, the Lord mighty in battle. Lift up your heads, you gates; lift them up, you ancient doors, that the King of glory may come in. Who is he, this King of glory? The Lord Almighty—he is the King of glory."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hebrew word translated as "glory" in Psalm 24 carries the connotation of solemnity and power. It signifies weightiness and importance. Thus, calling God the "King of Glory" means recognizing Him as the most awe-inspiring and powerful ruler, deserving of our utmost respect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The psalmist employs a form of personification known as apostrophe when addressing the "gates" and "ancient doors." This poetic technique commands them to open wide and allow the entrance of the King of glory. Even if these doors are already lofty, they must rise even higher to admit such an exalted presence as the Lord Himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Connecting with Shekinah Glory&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/otZ7hb6g1Cw" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a connection between the King of glory in Psalm 24 and the Shekinah glory described in Exodus 33. When God instructed Moses to build the Ark of the Covenant, He promised to appear in a cloud over the atonement cover or mercy seat (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Leviticus/16/Leviticus-16-2.html"&gt;Leviticus 16:2&lt;/a&gt;). The mercy seat was seen as God's glorious throne on earth. It was from this mercy seat that God spoke to Moses (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Exodus/25/Exodus-25-22.html"&gt;Exodus 25:22&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psalm 24 likely commemorates the entrance of the Ark of the Covenant into Jerusalem during David's reign (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/2-Samuel/6/2-Samuel-6-12.html"&gt;2 Samuel 6:12-17&lt;/a&gt;) or into the temple during Solomon's reign (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/2-Chronicles/5/2-Chronicles-5-7.html"&gt;2 Chronicles 5:7&lt;/a&gt;). The King of glory, represented by the Ark, entered through the gates of Jerusalem and the doors of the temple in a grand procession.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Jesus as the King of Glory&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-Corinthians/2/1-Corinthians-2-8.html"&gt;1 Corinthians 2:8&lt;/a&gt;, Jesus is referred to as "the Lord of glory." His triumphal entry into Jerusalem, where He was hailed by a jubilant crowd (Matthew 21), can be seen as a fulfillment of Psalm 24. Jesus is the one with clean hands and a pure heart who ascends the mountain of the Lord (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/24/Psalm-24-3.html"&gt;Psalm 24:3-4&lt;/a&gt;). He receives blessings from the Lord (verse 5) and is proclaimed as the "King of glory, the Lord strong and mighty, the Lord mighty in battle" (verse 8).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding God as the King of glory helps us grasp His majesty and power. It reminds us that we serve a God who is worthy of our reverence and awe. Recognizing His authority and sovereignty can deepen our faith and inspire us to worship Him wholeheartedly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, recognizing Jesus as the King of glory has profound implications for our salvation. Through His sacrificial death and resurrection, Jesus conquered sin and death, demonstrating His power and might. Embracing Him as our Lord and Savior allows us to enter into a personal relationship with the King of glory and experience His love, grace, and forgiveness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reflect on a time when you were truly in awe of God's majesty. How did it impact your faith and perspective?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In what ways can recognizing Jesus as the King of glory shape your daily life and interactions with others?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does understanding God's glory influence your worship and devotion?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we contemplate the concept of the King of glory, may we be filled with a deep sense of reverence and awe for our majestic God. Let us worship Him with all our hearts, acknowledging His authority and sovereignty in our lives. May we also find comfort and hope in Jesus, the King of glory, who has triumphed over sin and death on our behalf.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/The Identity of God/The Titles of God"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Ultimate Guide to Jehovah Jireh: Unveiling God''s Provision for Christian Living</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/jehovah-jireh/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-09-13T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-09-13T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-09-13:/jehovah-jireh/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Jehovah Jireh: The LORD Will Provide&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Introduction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the many names of God mentioned in the Old Testament is "Jehovah-Jireh," which signifies "The LORD Will Provide" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/22/Genesis-22-14.html"&gt;Genesis 22:14&lt;/a&gt;). This name was given by Abraham to memorialize an extraordinary event when God provided a ram as a substitute for …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Jehovah Jireh: The LORD Will Provide&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Introduction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the many names of God mentioned in the Old Testament is "Jehovah-Jireh," which signifies "The LORD Will Provide" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/22/Genesis-22-14.html"&gt;Genesis 22:14&lt;/a&gt;). This name was given by Abraham to memorialize an extraordinary event when God provided a ram as a substitute for his son Isaac, who was intended to be offered as a burnt offering. The story of Jehovah-Jireh begins with a peculiar command from God to Abraham, instructing him to sacrifice his "son of promise," Isaac. Let's delve into this remarkable account and explore its significance for us today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Abraham's Faith and God's Provision&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abraham, trusting in God's faithfulness, embarked on a journey with his son Isaac to the place specified by God. During their journey, Isaac questioned his father about the lamb for the offering. Abraham, with remarkable faith and foresight, responded, "God himself will provide the lamb for the burnt offering, my son." (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/22/Genesis-22-8.html"&gt;Genesis 22:8&lt;/a&gt;) Abraham believed that God would even raise Isaac from the dead if necessary (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/11/Hebrews-11-19.html"&gt;Hebrews 11:19&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When they arrived at the designated place, Abraham demonstrated his unwavering faith and obedience by building an altar, binding Isaac, and placing him on the wood. However, before Abraham could complete the offering, the Angel of the Lord called out from heaven, sparing Isaac's life. In that moment, Abraham noticed a ram caught in a thicket nearby. He took it and sacrificed it in place of his son.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Eternal Grace and Provision of Jehovah-Jireh&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abraham named the place "Jehovah-Jireh" because it symbolized God's gracious provision of a substitute for Isaac. This account serves as more than just a dramatic illustration of faith and obedience; it reveals the eternal grace, continual provision, and all-encompassing wisdom of the Lord. Jehovah-Jireh is not merely a name memorializing the past; it anticipates future actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The statement "on the mountain of the LORD it will be provided" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/22/Genesis-22-14.html"&gt;Genesis 22:14&lt;/a&gt;) holds significance not only for Mt. Moriah but also for Calvary, where God did not spare His own Son, but gave Him up for us all (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/8/Romans-8-32.html"&gt;Romans 8:32&lt;/a&gt;). Abraham's faith-filled proclamation that "God himself will provide the lamb" aligns with John the Baptist's exclamation, "Look, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/1/John-1-29.html"&gt;John 1:29&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jehovah-Jireh's provision of a sacrifice to save Isaac foreshadowed His ultimate provision of Jesus Christ as the Lamb of God for the salvation of humanity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The account of Jehovah-Jireh has significant implications for us as believers today. It reveals God's unwavering faithfulness and provision throughout history. Just as God provided a substitute for Isaac, He provides Jesus Christ as a substitute for our sins, offering salvation to all who believe in Him. This demonstrates God's immense love and grace towards humanity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, Jehovah-Jireh teaches us about faith and obedience. Abraham's unwavering trust in God, even in the face of a perplexing command, serves as a model for us to follow. We are called to have faith in God's promises and trust in His provision, even when circumstances seem challenging or uncertain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider how Jehovah-Jireh's provision impacts your life. Reflect on times when you have experienced God's faithfulness and provision. How can you cultivate a deeper trust in God's promises and His provision for your life?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Understanding Jehovah-Jireh&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To fully grasp the significance of Jehovah-Jireh and its relevance to our lives, let's break down some of the key concepts and terms involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Jehovah-Jireh: The LORD Will Provide&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The name "Jehovah-Jireh" originates from &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/22/Genesis-22-14.html"&gt;Genesis 22:14&lt;/a&gt;, where Abraham named the place of God's provision after God provided a ram as a substitute for Isaac. This name signifies that God will provide for His people's needs according to His perfect wisdom and timing. It reveals God's faithfulness, love, and grace in meeting our needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_McOIEud5hg" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Mt. Moriah and Calvary&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mt. Moriah is the mountain where Abraham was instructed to offer Isaac as a sacrifice. It holds great significance in biblical history as the place where Jehovah-Jireh provided a substitute sacrifice. Centuries later, King Solomon built the temple in the same location (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/2-Chronicles/3/2-Chronicles-3-1.html"&gt;2 Chronicles 3:1&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calvary, also known as Golgotha, is the hill outside Jerusalem where Jesus Christ was crucified. It is often referred to as the "mountain of the LORD" in relation to &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/22/Genesis-22-14.html"&gt;Genesis 22:14&lt;/a&gt;. The connection between Mt. Moriah and Calvary highlights God's ultimate provision of Jesus Christ as the Lamb of God, sacrificed for the salvation of humanity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The Lamb of God&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In both the story of Jehovah-Jireh and the New Testament, reference is made to the lamb provided by God. In Abraham's case, it was a ram caught in a thicket that served as a substitute for Isaac. In John the Baptist's proclamation, Jesus is referred to as "the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/1/John-1-29.html"&gt;John 1:29&lt;/a&gt;). This imagery symbolizes Jesus' sacrificial death on the cross, providing salvation and forgiveness for all who believe in Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept of Jehovah-Jireh matters greatly because it reveals God's character and His commitment to providing for His people. Understanding Jehovah-Jireh encourages us to trust in God's faithfulness and provision in our own lives. It reminds us of the ultimate provision of Jesus Christ as the Lamb of God, who offers salvation and forgiveness to all who believe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take a moment to reflect on the significance of Jehovah-Jireh in your life. Consider how God has provided for you and how His provision has impacted your faith journey. How can you deepen your trust in Jehovah-Jireh and rely on Him for your needs?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, the story of Jehovah-Jireh showcases God's faithfulness, grace, and provision throughout history. Just as He provided a substitute sacrifice for Isaac, God provides Jesus Christ as the ultimate sacrifice for our sins. Understanding Jehovah-Jireh encourages us to trust in God's promises and provision, knowing that He will provide for our needs according to His perfect wisdom and timing. May we embrace the truth of Jehovah-Jireh and live with unwavering faith in His provision for our lives.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/The Identity of God/The Titles of God"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Unveiling the Truth About Flying Spaghetti Monsterism: A Christian Perspective</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/flying-spaghetti-monsterism/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-09-08T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-09-08T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-09-08:/flying-spaghetti-monsterism/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Flying Spaghetti Monsterism: A Satirical Take on Intelligent Design&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flying Spaghetti Monsterism, also known as Pastafarianism, is a satirical "religion" created by Bobby Henderson. It was designed as a protest against the teaching of intelligent design in schools as an alternative to the theory of evolution. Henderson's aim was to highlight the absurdity of giving equal time to what he considered foolish religious ideas. He created a set of humorous beliefs centered around the idea that a Flying Spaghetti Monster created the world and deceived scientists into believing in evolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Basis of Flying Spaghetti Monsterism&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reasoning behind Flying Spaghetti Monsterism is based on the following premises:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is no evidence for the existence of the Judeo-Christian God.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is no evidence for the existence of the Flying Spaghetti Monster.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Therefore, belief in the Judeo-Christian God and belief in the Flying Spaghetti Monster are on equal grounds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, there are some problems with this line of thinking. The first premise is false because there is evidence for the existence of the Judeo-Christian God. While Mr. Henderson may not accept this evidence, he fails to provide a thorough refutation of the classical and contemporary arguments for God's existence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There have been numerous philosophical arguments put forth for the existence of God, such as cosmological arguments (which argue for a first cause), teleological arguments (which argue for a Grand Designer), and moral arguments (which argue for a Moral Lawgiver). Many brilliant minds throughout history have pondered the question of God's existence and have come to the conclusion that God does exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Contrasting Belief in God and Belief in the Flying Spaghetti Monster&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qjf541gQREM" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are significant contrasts between belief in God and belief in the Flying Spaghetti Monster:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prevalence: Belief in God is widespread among different cultures and throughout history, while belief in the Flying Spaghetti Monster is non-existent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Philosophical Arguments: There are numerous sophisticated philosophical arguments for God's existence, while there are no technical arguments for the Flying Spaghetti Monster.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Coherence: The concept of the Christian God provides a coherent explanation for various aspects of existence, such as why something exists rather than nothing, why logic is universal, why morality is objective, and why religion is ubiquitous. In contrast, belief in the Flying Spaghetti Monster does not provide any meaningful explanation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rational Satisfaction: Belief in God can be rationally satisfying due to the philosophical arguments and evidence supporting it. On the other hand, belief in the Flying Spaghetti Monster lacks any rational basis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there are atheists who take theistic arguments seriously and engage with them, many atheists do not thoroughly consider these arguments. Popular atheist texts often refute weak or incomplete arguments for theism without engaging with more robust philosophical and theological arguments. It is important to approach the question of God's existence with intellectual honesty and give serious consideration to the arguments put forth by Christian philosophers and theologians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the differences between belief in God and belief in the Flying Spaghetti Monster helps us recognize that belief in God is based on rationality and supported by good reasons. Christianity, as a religion, offers a coherent worldview that addresses fundamental questions about existence, logic, morality, beauty, and more. It is intellectually stimulating and has been thoroughly explored by brilliant minds throughout history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By contrast, belief in the Flying Spaghetti Monster is a satirical invention that lacks any meaningful basis or intellectual depth. Recognizing these distinctions helps us approach discussions about faith and religion with clarity and discernment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have you encountered the concept of the Flying Spaghetti Monster before? How did you perceive it?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are your thoughts on the existence of God? Have you considered the philosophical arguments for God's existence?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How do you evaluate and engage with different religious beliefs and worldviews? What criteria do you use to determine their rationality and coherence?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are you open to exploring the intellectual richness of the Christian faith and engaging with its philosophical and theological arguments?&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the Christian faith, the use of masculine pronouns to refer to God has been a topic of discussion. While it is important to understand that God, being a spiritual being, does not possess a physical gender, He has chosen to reveal Himself using masculine pronouns …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Masculine Pronouns for God&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Christian faith, the use of masculine pronouns to refer to God has been a topic of discussion. While it is important to understand that God, being a spiritual being, does not possess a physical gender, He has chosen to reveal Himself using masculine pronouns and imagery. This article aims to explore the biblical basis for using masculine pronouns when referring to God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1. God's Self-Revelation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the very beginning, in the book of Genesis, God refers to Himself using masculine pronouns: "So God created mankind in his own image, in the image of God he created them; male and female he created them" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/1/Genesis-1-27.html"&gt;Genesis 1:27&lt;/a&gt;). This indicates that God intentionally chose to reveal Himself in masculine terms. In ancient Hebrew, there were no grammatically neutral-gender pronouns, so all items were given a grammatical gender of either masculine or feminine. Therefore, the use of masculine pronouns to refer to God was deliberate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2. Masculine Pronouns in the Old Testament&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout the Old Testament, the pronouns used to refer to God are grammatically masculine. Even though the Koine Greek language of the New Testament had gender-neutral terms available, God is still referred to using masculine gender pronouns. This consistent use of masculine language reinforces the understanding that God has chosen to reveal Himself in this way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;3. Metaphors and Titles Describing God&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pez-Jp7ORcc" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The imagery used in the Bible further supports the use of masculine pronouns for God. Numerous metaphors and titles are employed to describe Him. For instance, there are numerous references to God as a Father, King, and Husband. Jesus taught His disciples to pray specifically addressing "our Father" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/11/Luke-11-2.html"&gt;Luke 11:2&lt;/a&gt;). The Bible also explicitly refers to God as a king (not a queen) in many passages. Additionally, God is described as a husband, emphasizing His role in relationships and providing further evidence of the masculine imagery associated with Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;4. Motherly Imagery&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the Bible primarily uses masculine language for God, there are a few instances where motherly imagery is employed. For example, in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/66/Isaiah-66-13.html"&gt;Isaiah 66:13&lt;/a&gt;, God is compared to a mother comforting her child. However, it is important to note that even in this comparison, God does not present Himself as a mother, but rather emphasizes His ability to comfort His people like a mother would. Similarly, &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/49/Isaiah-49-15.html"&gt;Isaiah 49:15&lt;/a&gt; contrasts God's care for His people with that of a nursing mother, illustrating the depth of His love and care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding why masculine pronouns are used to refer to God is significant for several reasons. Firstly, it allows us to align our language with how God has chosen to reveal Himself. It helps us maintain the integrity of biblical teachings and the authority of Scripture. Additionally, recognizing the use of masculine imagery reminds us of the unique roles and attributes associated with God as Father, King, and Husband.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reflecting on the use of masculine pronouns for God can lead us to contemplate the nature of God and deepen our understanding of His character. It reminds us that God has intentionally revealed Himself to humanity through language that reflects masculine qualities. Considering these aspects can foster a greater appreciation for the ways in which God relates to His creation and desires to establish loving relationships with us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, while God does not possess a physical gender as a spiritual being, He has chosen to reveal Himself using masculine pronouns and imagery throughout the Bible. By recognizing this intentional revelation, we can align our language with how God has chosen to present Himself. The consistent use of masculine language in Scripture reinforces the importance of referring to God using masculine pronouns. Understanding this aspect enriches our understanding of God's character and encourages us to deepen our relationship with Him.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/The Character of God/Anthropomorphism"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>7 Divine Names of God Every Christian Should Know</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/names-of-god/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-09-08T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-09-08T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-09-08:/names-of-god/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Names of God&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout the Bible, there are many names used to describe God, each capturing a different aspect of His character. These names provide insight into His nature and attributes. Let's explore some of the well-known names of God:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1. Lord&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most common names for God …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Names of God&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout the Bible, there are many names used to describe God, each capturing a different aspect of His character. These names provide insight into His nature and attributes. Let's explore some of the well-known names of God:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1. Lord&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most common names for God is "Lord." In the Old Testament, this name is used in place of YHWH, which was considered too sacred to be spoken by sinful humans. The name "Lord" signifies God's authority and sovereignty over all things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2. God Almighty&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another name for God is "God Almighty" or "The Mighty One of Jacob." This name emphasizes God's ultimate power and strength. It reminds us that He has complete control over all creation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;3. LORD&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Bible, "LORD" (in all capitals) is the only proper name for God. In Hebrew, it is YHWH, which means "I Am who I Am." This name reveals God's immediate presence and accessibility to those who call on Him for deliverance, forgiveness, and guidance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;4. The Lord Will Provide&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This name comes from &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/22/Genesis-22-14.html"&gt;Genesis 22:14&lt;/a&gt; when Abraham named the place where God provided a ram for sacrifice instead of Isaac. It reminds us that God is our provider who meets our needs according to His perfect plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;5. The Lord Who Heals&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Exodus/15/Exodus-15-26.html"&gt;Exodus 15:26&lt;/a&gt;, God reveals Himself as "The Lord Who Heals." This name encompasses both physical and spiritual healing. It assures us that God has the power to preserve us from diseases and forgive our iniquities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;6. The Lord Our Shepherd&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8UQf9zZBzv4" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This name is derived from &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/23/Psalm-23-1.html"&gt;Psalm 23:1&lt;/a&gt; where David declares, "The Lord is my shepherd." It illustrates God's care and guidance in our lives, just as a shepherd cares for his sheep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;7. The Lord of Hosts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The Lord of Hosts" emphasizes God's majesty, power, and authority. It signifies His dominion over both the heavenly hosts and the inhabitants of the earth. This name reminds us that God is capable of accomplishing His plans and purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;8. Most High&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God is often referred to as the "Most High." This name highlights His exalted position and absolute right to lordship. It signifies His supreme authority over all creation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These names of God reveal different aspects of His character and nature. They remind us of His power, provision, healing, guidance, and authority. Understanding these names helps us develop a deeper relationship with God and trust in His faithfulness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowing the names of God allows us to have a more intimate understanding of who He is. It helps us relate to Him on a personal level and build trust in His character. By understanding these names, we can approach God with confidence, knowing that He is capable of meeting our needs and providing for us in every way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take some time to reflect on the various names of God mentioned above. How do these names impact your understanding of who God is? How can you incorporate these names into your prayer life and worship? Consider how these names can deepen your relationship with God and strengthen your faith in Him as you navigate through life's challenges.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/The Identity of God/The Names of God"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Discover the Ultimate Truth: One True God Revealed</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/one-true-god/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-09-08T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-09-08T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-09-08:/one-true-god/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;The One True God&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question of the one true God is of utmost importance as it pertains to our understanding of the divine and our relationship with Him. In a world filled with various gods and belief systems, distinguishing the one true God becomes crucial. While false gods are creations of human imagination and hold no real power, the one true God is full of glory, grace, and truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Attributes of the One True God&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the Bible, the one true God is the sovereign Creator of the universe, existing independently of anything else. He is a spiritual being, eternal in nature, and possesses personal qualities. Unlike the numerous false gods found in different religions, the one true God encompasses all knowledge, power, and is omnipresent. Furthermore, He is unchanging, just, loving, truthful, holy, compassionate, merciful, gracious, and forgiving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Triune Nature of God&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The one true God is unique in His triune nature. The Bible reveals that within the divine essence exists three distinct Persons: the Father, the Son (Jesus Christ), and the Holy Spirit. This triunity sets Him apart from other monotheistic religions like Islam. Denying Jesus Christ denies a relationship with the Father as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LNYr2fSToA4" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The Revelation of the One True God&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The one true God desires to be known by humanity. He has revealed Himself throughout history in various ways. Creation itself displays His power and glory. He established a covenant with Abraham and his descendants, forming them into a new nation. Later on, He revealed Himself to Moses and began to disclose His nature through His written Word, the Bible. Ultimately, God provided the ultimate revelation of Himself in Jesus Christ—God made flesh—who dwelt among us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Choosing the One True God&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all have a choice when it comes to whom we worship. Just as Joshua called upon the Israelites to choose between the one true God and the gods of the Amorites, we too must make a decision. The worship of false deities only leads to death, while knowing and following the one true God leads to eternal life. We can learn from Ruth, who chose the one true God over the idols of Moab.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the identity of the one true God is crucial for our faith and relationship with Him. It helps us discern between truth and falsehood, guiding us away from worshiping false gods. Knowing the attributes of the one true God enables us to trust in His justice, love, truthfulness, holiness, compassion, mercy, grace, and forgiveness. Recognizing His triune nature allows us to have a complete understanding of His character. Ultimately, choosing to worship the one true God opens up the path to eternal life through Jesus Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Think About It&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does recognizing the attributes of the one true God impact your understanding of His character and your relationship with Him?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In what ways can you actively choose to worship the one true God in your daily life?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consider the significance of Jesus Christ as the ultimate revelation of the one true God. How does this affect your perspective on salvation and eternal life?&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The term "Ancient of Days" is mentioned in the Bible and is associated with God. It first appears in the book of Daniel, specifically in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Daniel/7/Daniel-7-9.html"&gt;Daniel 7:9&lt;/a&gt;. In this passage, Daniel describes a vision of heaven where he sees an ancient Person sitting on a flaming …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Ancient of Days&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The term "Ancient of Days" is mentioned in the Bible and is associated with God. It first appears in the book of Daniel, specifically in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Daniel/7/Daniel-7-9.html"&gt;Daniel 7:9&lt;/a&gt;. In this passage, Daniel describes a vision of heaven where he sees an ancient Person sitting on a flaming throne with wheels of fire. This person has hair and clothing that are white as snow. The flaming throne symbolizes judgment, while the white hair and the title "Ancient of Days" indicate that God existed before time began.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/43/Isaiah-43-13.html"&gt;Isaiah 43:13&lt;/a&gt;, God refers to Himself as existing from the "ancient of days", which means "before days were". This implies that God existed before days were even created. We learn from Genesis 1 that God created time, days, and nights, so He existed before the beginning of time itself. God is often represented as ancient because He is "from everlasting to everlasting" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/90/Psalm-90-2.html"&gt;Psalm 90:2&lt;/a&gt;) and is described as "the first and the last" in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/44/Isaiah-44-6.html"&gt;Isaiah 44:6&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to note that the title "Ancient of Days" is found only three times in Scripture, all three in prophetic passages in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Daniel/7/Daniel-7-9.html"&gt;Daniel 7:9&lt;/a&gt;, 13, and 22. In verse 22, the term specifically refers to Jesus Christ, whose judgment will be part of end-times events. In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Daniel/7/Daniel-7-13.html"&gt;Daniel 7:13&lt;/a&gt;, the term "ancient of days" refers to God the Father, and we see Him on His throne as Jesus, referred to as the "Son of Man," approaches the throne on clouds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Ancient of Days as Judge&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The description of the Ancient of Days in Daniel 7 is closely related to judgment. In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Revelation/1/Revelation-1-14.html"&gt;Revelation 1:14-15&lt;/a&gt;, a similar description is used to depict Jesus Christ, who has snow-white hair and blazing eyes. In the book of Revelation, Jesus, as the Son of God, exercises the power of judgment over His church, just as the Ancient of Days judges Israel. His sharp gaze in Revelation 1–3 represents His complete understanding and judgment of the reality of all there is to know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/V4dR_zuB3qk" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The Triune God&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept of the Ancient of Days also highlights the triune nature of God. God is a triune God, meaning three Persons in One. At different times, the term "Ancient of Days" refers to both Jesus Christ and God the Father. In the prophetic sense, it clearly refers to Jesus, the Ancient of Days, who will return to pronounce judgment on the world (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Daniel/7/Daniel-7-22.html"&gt;Daniel 7:22&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the concept of the Ancient of Days helps us grasp the eternal nature of God and His authority as Judge. It reminds us that God existed before time began and that He has always been in control. The title "Ancient of Days" also emphasizes the triune nature of God, highlighting the unique roles and relationships within the Godhead. This concept ultimately points us to Jesus Christ, who will return as the Ancient of Days to bring final judgment and establish His kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does the idea of God as the Ancient of Days impact your understanding of His eternal nature?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What does it mean for Jesus to be referred to as the Ancient of Days in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Daniel/7/Daniel-7-13.html"&gt;Daniel 7:13&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does the concept of the Ancient of Days influence your understanding of God's authority and role as Judge?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reflect on the triune nature of God and how it is represented by the term "Ancient of Days." How does this deepen your understanding of the Trinity?&lt;/li&gt;

While some historians argue for this position, there is actually no evidence to support it. The most common assertion is that God and a mother goddess …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Does God Have a Wife?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout history, there have been claims that God, specifically the God of the Bible, had a wife or consort. While some historians argue for this position, there is actually no evidence to support it. The most common assertion is that God and a mother goddess named Asherah were originally considered a couple in ancient Israelite religion. However, there is no evidence of manipulation in the Old Testament manuscripts to remove Asherah as God's wife.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bible presents marriage as an institution created by God for humankind alone. In Genesis 2, God recognizes that it is not good for man to be alone and creates a suitable helper for him, which is woman. This establishes marriage as the physical and spiritual union between a husband and wife. Therefore, God does not need a wife or companion because He has always existed in a loving relationship within the triune being of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, there is biblical evidence that suggests marriage will become obsolete in the eternal state. Jesus addressed a hypothetical question from the Sadducees about marriage in the next life and stated that people will neither marry nor be given in marriage (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/22/Matthew-22-30.html"&gt;Matthew 22:30&lt;/a&gt;). This indicates that marriage is a temporary institution designed for human beings in this life only.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pagan religions often depicted their false gods with wives, consorts, and love interests. However, the One True God of the Bible is distinct from these idols. There is no evidence in Scripture to suggest that God has ever been portrayed as having a wife. The Scriptures also demonstrate why God does not need marriage and why marriage itself is designed by God exclusively for human beings in this life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5sw-NFvueK8" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Understanding whether God has a wife or not may seem like an obscure topic, but it actually has significant implications for our understanding of who God is and the nature of marriage. Recognizing that God does not have a wife emphasizes His self-sufficiency and completeness within the Trinity. It also highlights the unique purpose of marriage as an earthly institution designed for human companionship and procreation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider the significance of God's self-sufficiency and completeness within the Trinity. How does this understanding shape your understanding of God's character and relationship with humanity? How does recognizing the temporary nature of marriage in the eternal state impact your perspective on the purpose of marriage in this life?&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/The Identity of God/The Faulty Assumptions"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Uncovering the Mystery: God''s Hidden Presence Revealed in Scripture</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/god-hidden/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-09-06T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-09-06T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-09-06:/god-hidden/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;God's Hiddenness: Understanding God's Revelation and His Presence Today&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Bible, we find accounts of God's direct interaction with people, performing miracles, speaking audibly, and revealing Himself in undeniable ways.

&lt;p&gt;In the Bible, we find accounts of God's direct interaction with people, performing miracles, speaking audibly, and revealing Himself in undeniable ways. However, many wonder why God seems hidden and silent today. In order to understand this apparent hiddenness, we need to consider several key points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1. Hiddenness Due to Sin and Unbelief&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One reason why God may seem hidden today is the presence of willful, unrepentant sin. The Bible tells us that when people cry out to the Lord but continue in their evil ways, He may hide His face from them (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Micah/3/Micah-3-4.html"&gt;Micah 3:4&lt;/a&gt;). Additionally, without faith, it is impossible to please God (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/11/Hebrews-11-6.html"&gt;Hebrews 11:6&lt;/a&gt;). Sometimes people fail to perceive evidence of God's presence because they refuse to believe (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/6/Mark-6-1.html"&gt;Mark 6:1-6&lt;/a&gt;). It becomes challenging to see when one's eyes remain closed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Recognizing the impact of sin and unbelief helps us understand why some may struggle to see or experience God's presence in their lives. It underscores the importance of repentance and faith as a means to perceive and encounter God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; Have you ever experienced a time when your unbelief or sinful choices hindered your ability to recognize God's presence? How did repentance and faith open your eyes?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2. Progressive Revelation in History&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Far from being entirely hidden, God has revealed Himself progressively throughout history. He used miracles and direct communication with individuals to unveil His character, provide instructions, and disclose His plans. However, these moments were interspersed with times of silence when new revelation was not forthcoming (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-Samuel/3/1-Samuel-3-1.html"&gt;1 Samuel 3:1&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God's first act of revelation was through creation itself. The wonders of the natural world serve as a constant reminder of His existence and display His attributes (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/1/Romans-1-20.html"&gt;Romans 1:20&lt;/a&gt;). Creation was God's initial declaration to humanity, demonstrating His power, sovereignty, and eternality. Following creation, God spoke directly to Adam and Eve, giving them commandments and warning them of the consequences of disobedience. He also promised to send a Savior to redeem mankind from sin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout history, God revealed Himself intermittently. He spoke to individuals like Noah and Moses, providing guidance and delivering miracles to authenticate His messengers. Miracles were also performed during Joshua's time, as well as during the ministries of Elijah and Elisha, to confirm the prophetic word and combat idolatry. However, between these times of divine intervention, generations passed without witnessing miracles or hearing the voice of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Understanding the concept of progressive revelation helps us see that God's plan for unfolding His truth was not continuous miraculous events or constant audible communication. It highlights the significance of different periods in history and the unique ways God chose to reveal Himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; Reflect on the various ways God has chosen to reveal Himself throughout history. How does this pattern of progressive revelation deepen your trust in His sovereignty?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;3. The Completed Canon of Scripture&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One reason why God may seem hidden today is that He has already completed His plan of revelation. The Bible is the finished product of God's progressive revelation to humanity (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Revelation/22/Revelation-22-18.html"&gt;Revelation 22:18&lt;/a&gt;). The Scriptures contain everything we need for doctrine, reproof, correction, and instruction in righteousness (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/2-Timothy/3/2-Timothy-3-16.html"&gt;2 Timothy 3:16&lt;/a&gt;). The Bible is sufficient in making us wise unto salvation through faith in Christ Jesus (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/2-Timothy/3/2-Timothy-3-15.html"&gt;2 Timothy 3:15&lt;/a&gt;). It is a reliable source of prophecy that we should pay close attention to (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/2-Peter/1/2-Peter-1-19.html"&gt;2 Peter 1:19&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Recognizing the completeness and sufficiency of Scripture helps us understand that we do not need additional miracles or revelations to validate the Bible. The Bible stands as the ultimate authority for our faith and practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; How does the understanding that the Bible is complete and sufficient affect your approach to seeking spiritual guidance and truth?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HndJGVB3C5I" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;4. The Role of the Holy Spirit&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While God may not be speaking audibly or providing new revelations today, the Holy Spirit still plays a crucial role in our lives as believers. The Spirit serves as our Comforter (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/14/John-14-16.html"&gt;John 14:16&lt;/a&gt;) and works in conjunction with our conscience to guide us. However, it's important to note that the Holy Spirit does not provide new revelations. Instead, He speaks to us through the written Word of God, which functions as the "sword of the Spirit" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Ephesians/6/Ephesians-6-17.html"&gt;Ephesians 6:17&lt;/a&gt;). The Holy Spirit reminds us of specific Scriptures when needed, illuminates our understanding of the Word, and empowers us to live according to its teachings (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/14/John-14-26.html"&gt;John 14:26&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Recognizing that the Holy Spirit's role is not to provide new revelations but to guide us through Scripture helps us avoid potential pitfalls of seeking extra-biblical revelations or claiming new knowledge not found in God's Word.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; In what ways have you experienced the guidance of the Holy Spirit through Scripture? How has this impacted your faith journey?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;5. Living by Faith, Not by Sight&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The prophet Habakkuk declares that "the just shall live by his faith" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Habakkuk/2/Habakkuk-2-4.html"&gt;Habakkuk 2:4&lt;/a&gt;). Rather than continually receiving miraculous signs, God expects His people to trust in what He has already done, search the Scriptures daily, and live by faith (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/16/Matthew-16-4.html"&gt;Matthew 16:4&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/20/John-20-29.html"&gt;John 20:29&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/2-Corinthians/5/2-Corinthians-5-7.html"&gt;2 Corinthians 5:7&lt;/a&gt;). Although there may be times when it seems that God is doing nothing, He remains the sovereign Lord of all creation, constantly working to fulfill His perfect plan. The book of Esther serves as a prime example of God's hidden working, where His hand is never mentioned but is evident from beginning to end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Understanding the call to live by faith encourages us to trust in God's sovereignty and faithfulness even in times when His presence may seem hidden. It underscores the importance of relying on His Word and maintaining a steadfast faith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; How has living by faith, rather than relying solely on visible signs or experiences, deepened your relationship with God?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;6. The Ultimate Purpose of God's Hiddenness&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we may not fully comprehend why God chooses to be "hidden" at times, we can trust that He has a purpose in it. It is through periods of apparent hiddenness that God often works in ways we cannot immediately perceive or understand. Just as He worked behind the scenes in Esther's story, God continues to work silently, orchestrating events according to His perfect plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Recognizing that God works even in His hiddenness helps us maintain trust in His sovereignty and understand that there are aspects of His plan beyond our immediate perception.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; In what ways have you witnessed God's silent work in your life or the lives of others? How does this strengthen your faith?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, while it may seem that God is hidden or silent today, we can find assurance in understanding the reasons behind His apparent hiddenness. Sin and unbelief can blind us to His presence, and throughout history, God has progressively revealed Himself at specific times. The completed canon of Scripture provides us with everything we need for faith and practice. The Holy Spirit guides us through the Word of God rather than providing new revelations. Living by faith helps us trust in God's sovereignty, even when He seems hidden. Ultimately, we can find comfort in knowing that even in apparent hiddenness, God is at work, fulfilling His perfect plan.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/The Character of God/How God Works"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Divine Provision: How God Provides for His Believers</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/god-provides/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-09-06T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-09-06T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-09-06:/god-provides/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;God's Provision: A Source of Abundant Blessings&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Bible, there are numerous verses that speak about God's provision for His people. One such verse is &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Philippians/4/Philippians-4-19.html"&gt;Philippians 4:19&lt;/a&gt;, which assures us that God will supply all our needs according to His riches in glory in Christ Jesus. However, it …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;God's Provision: A Source of Abundant Blessings&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Bible, there are numerous verses that speak about God's provision for His people. One such verse is &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Philippians/4/Philippians-4-19.html"&gt;Philippians 4:19&lt;/a&gt;, which assures us that God will supply all our needs according to His riches in glory in Christ Jesus. However, it is crucial to understand that God's provision extends beyond material possessions and encompasses every aspect of our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1. God's Desire for Our Well-being&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as a loving parent desires the best for their child, God wants to provide for us in a way that promotes our growth and development into Christlikeness. He knows what is best for us and would never give us something that would harm us. Therefore, it is essential to recognize that God's provision goes beyond material possessions and encompasses spiritual growth and transformation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding God's intention behind His provision helps us shift our focus from acquiring earthly possessions to seeking a deeper relationship with Him. It encourages us to align our desires with His and prioritize eternal matters over temporary gains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Think About It&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider how you can cultivate a heart that seeks God's provision not only for material needs but also for spiritual growth and transformation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2. Differentiating between Needs and Wants&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God differentiates between our needs and wants because He understands that where our treasure is, our heart will also be. He wants us to recognize that this world is not our ultimate home, and part of what we truly need is to shift our focus towards eternal life while still living in the present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the difference between needs and wants helps us align our priorities with God's perspective. It allows us to seek His kingdom first and trust Him to provide for our genuine needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Think About It&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take some time to reflect on your own desires and priorities. Are you seeking after material possessions or focusing on the eternal life that God offers?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;3. God's Comprehensive Care for Us&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God's provision extends to every part of our being - spirit, soul, and body. He is infinitely good and desires to provide for us in ways that surpass our understanding. His care goes beyond what we could ever achieve on our own, and we can trust in His guidance and shepherding to lead us towards a fulfilling life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recognizing God's comprehensive care for us brings comfort and assurance in times of need or uncertainty. It reminds us that we are never alone, and God is always working for our good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Think About It&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider the ways in which you have experienced God's comprehensive care in your life. Reflect on how it has brought you comfort and reassurance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;4. Trusting God for Daily Provision&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Lord's Prayer, Jesus teaches His disciples to ask for daily provision, acknowledging our dependence on God. He assures us that the Father knows our needs and encourages us to seek first His kingdom and righteousness. By entrusting our daily requirements to God, we acknowledge His covenant relationship with us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trusting God for our daily provision deepens our reliance on Him and strengthens our faith. It reminds us that He is not only concerned about our physical needs but also desires a close relationship with us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Think About It&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/d8BwydIR-r0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reflect on your own prayer life. Do you trust God to provide for your daily needs? How can you deepen your reliance on Him in this area?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;5. Walking Uprightly: A Key to Receiving Provision&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/84/Psalm-84-11.html"&gt;Psalm 84:11&lt;/a&gt; states that God does not withhold any good thing from those who walk uprightly. This verse emphasizes the importance of living a righteous life as we seek God's provision. Our actions and motives play a significant role in experiencing the fullness of His blessings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the connection between our obedience and God's provision helps us align our lives with His will. It reminds us of the importance of living in righteousness and seeking to honor Him in all we do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Think About It&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reflect on your own life. Are there areas where you need to align your actions and motives with God's will? How can you cultivate a lifestyle of obedience to experience His provision more fully?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;6. The Importance of Prayerful Motivations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/James/4/James-4-3.html"&gt;James 4:3&lt;/a&gt; reminds us that sometimes our prayers go unanswered because we ask with wrong motives. God sees the intentions of our hearts, and our prayers' motivations are crucial to Him. It is important to align our desires with His will and seek His purposes above our own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the significance of prayerful motivations helps us approach God with a sincere heart. It encourages us to examine our own desires and align them with what honors and glorifies Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Think About It&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take some time to reflect on your own prayer life. Are your motivations aligned with God's will? How can you ensure that your prayers are rooted in a sincere desire to honor Him?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;7. God's Provision for Every Area of Life&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God's provision goes beyond our physical needs and encompasses the needs of our soul and spirit. He offers peace, comfort, power, love, self-discipline, and every spiritual blessing in Christ Jesus. In whatever circumstances we find ourselves, we can find contentment in the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the depth of God's provision allows us to find true contentment in Him, regardless of our external circumstances. It reminds us that His blessings extend far beyond material possessions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Think About It&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reflect on the ways in which you have experienced God's provision in your spiritual life. How has He provided peace, comfort, or other spiritual blessings? Take a moment to thank Him for His faithfulness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;8. God's Provision for All Creation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God's provision extends to His ongoing relationship with all of His creation. He watches over the rain, sun, winds, and tides, ensuring the well-being of all living beings. His love and care are evident in the intricate balance of nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recognizing God's provision for all creation reminds us of His sovereignty and goodness. It encourages us to appreciate and care for the world He has entrusted to us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Think About It&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take a moment to reflect on the beauty of nature and the ways in which God provides for all living beings. How can you be a good steward of the environment and reflect His care for creation?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, God's provision is not limited to material possessions but encompasses every aspect of our lives. Understanding His desire for our well-being, differentiating between needs and wants, trusting Him for daily provision, walking uprightly, aligning our prayers with His will, experiencing His provision in every area of life, and recognizing His care for all creation are all essential aspects of comprehending and appreciating God's abundant blessings. May we continually seek to deepen our understanding and experience of God's provision in our lives.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/God's Relationship to Us/He Cares For Us"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>The Ultimate Christian Attribute Above All Others</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/attribute-above-all-others/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-09-05T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-09-05T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-09-05:/attribute-above-all-others/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;The Importance of Understanding God's Attributes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it comes to understanding God's attributes, there are two important considerations: which attributes are most important for us to understand, and whether some attributes are more important for God Himself. From a human perspective, our understanding of God's qualities must come in a certain order because we are not infinite or perfect. However, when we look at the attributes of God, we find that they are all equally perfect and unchangeable. There is no practical difference in their importance to God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Equally Perfect Attributes of God&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order for a being to be truly "infinitely" perfect, they must be perfect in all qualities. For example, a being cannot have all possible power without also having all possible knowledge. All of God's attributes exist in cooperation with one another and cannot be ranked on a scale of importance. They are equally perfect, infinite, and ranked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BtUNFuUpXu8" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The Starting Point: God's Holiness&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a human perspective, the starting point for understanding who God is His holiness. God's holiness means that He is set apart from mankind in a radical and fundamental way. He is perfection without any unrighteousness. Without recognizing this uniqueness, none of His other qualities make sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Building Blocks for Understanding God's Attributes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we can fully grasp certain attributes of God that are more connected to human experience, we need to understand those that are "beyond" mankind. God's holiness, sovereignty, and omnipotence serve as crucial foundations for our understanding of His other qualities such as love and justice. Although none of God's qualities are "more" or "less" present than the others due to His perfection, we can arrange them in a logical order to help our limited human minds comprehend Him. This logical order starts with His holiness, extends to His power (omnipotence, sovereignty), and then to His personality (love, mercy, justice).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding God's attributes is crucial for our relationship with Him. It allows us to grasp a glimpse of His nature and character, and it shapes our understanding of His actions and dealings with humanity. Recognizing God's holiness helps us approach Him with reverence and awe. Appreciating His sovereignty and power enables us to trust in His control over all things. Understanding His love, mercy, and justice helps us relate to Him on a personal level and comprehend His plans for our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reflecting on God's attributes can lead to a deeper relationship with Him. Consider how your understanding of God's holiness has shaped your perception of Him. How does recognizing His sovereignty and power impact your trust in Him? How does knowing His love, mercy, and justice influence your relationship with Him and others? Take time to meditate on these attributes and their significance in your walk with God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, while all of God's attributes are equally perfect and important to who He is, our understanding of them must come in a certain order due to our limited human perspective. Starting with God's holiness as the foundation, we can build upon that understanding to grasp His power and personality. Reflecting on these attributes deepens our relationship with God and shapes our understanding of His nature and character. Let us continually seek to know Him more fully by exploring His attributes and drawing near to Him.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/The Character of God/God’s Holiness"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Unveiling the Mystery of GAOTU: The Divine Architect Revealed</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/gaotu/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-09-05T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-09-05T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-09-05:/gaotu/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Great Architect of the Universe&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The term Great Architect of the Universe (GAOTU) is commonly used in Masonic teaching and has significance within Freemasonry. However, it is important to note that the Great Architect of the Universe is not synonymous with the God of the Bible. While belief in GAOTU …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Great Architect of the Universe&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The term Great Architect of the Universe (GAOTU) is commonly used in Masonic teaching and has significance within Freemasonry. However, it is important to note that the Great Architect of the Universe is not synonymous with the God of the Bible. While belief in GAOTU acknowledges the existence of a divine creator, it does not necessarily affirm the truth about who God is according to biblical teachings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What is the Great Architect of the Universe?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept of the Great Architect of the Universe is a foundational belief in Freemasonry. It is a neutral term used to refer to a divine being or creator. Freemasonry does not define or prescribe specific attributes or doctrines about this deity. Instead, it assumes that God is a reality in the mind of every individual, allowing each person to fashion their own theological and philosophical theories about God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Biblical Perspective&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a biblical perspective, God can be considered the "Architect of the Universe" as He is recognized as the Creator in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/1/Genesis-1-1.html"&gt;Genesis 1:1&lt;/a&gt;. The idea that the world is the result of an Intelligent Designer is a common starting point across various belief systems. However, it is essential to understand that Freemasonry's concept of GAOTU differs from the God depicted in the Bible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Different Gods, Different Beliefs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yzvBwEmqKJE" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Various non-Christian groups, including Jews, Muslims, Deists, and certain Native American tribes, acknowledge a creator deity. However, their beliefs differ from those described in the Bible. Freemasonry's reference to GAOTU allows for different interpretations and theories about God without affirming any specific truth claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Ambiguity of GAOTU&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Freemasonry intentionally uses the term GAOTU as an ambiguous and neutral term. The Masonic publication states that Freemasonry does not demand that individuals define or accept any specific definitions of God. The Craft assumes that God is real but leaves it up to each person to determine their own beliefs about God's nature and attributes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The True God of the Bible&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast to Freemasonry's approach, the God of the Bible is known through Jesus Christ, as stated in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/14/John-14-6.html"&gt;John 14:6&lt;/a&gt;, 9. The biblical God exists as a three-in-one Tri-unity and has clearly communicated what humanity needs to know about Him through special revelation, as described in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/1/Hebrews-1-1.html"&gt;Hebrews 1:1-3&lt;/a&gt;. Therefore, faith in Jesus Christ is not optional for those seeking a biblical understanding of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Limitations of Belief in GAOTU&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Belief in the Great Architect of the Universe acknowledges the existence of some divine being but falls short of fully embracing a biblical faith. &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/James/2/James-2-19.html"&gt;James 2:19&lt;/a&gt; compares this kind of belief to that of demons who also believe in the existence of God but do not have a saving faith. True faith requires more than just acknowledging the existence of a deity; it necessitates a personal relationship with Jesus Christ and submission to biblical truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the distinction between the Great Architect of the Universe in Freemasonry and the God of the Bible is crucial for Christians. It highlights the importance of biblical truth and the exclusivity of salvation through Jesus Christ. Believers should be wary of syncretistic tendencies or attempts to merge conflicting theological ideas. This knowledge can help Christians engage in meaningful conversations with those influenced by Masonic teachings while presenting the fullness of biblical truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Think About It&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider how different belief systems acknowledge the existence of a creator deity. Reflect on how your faith in Jesus Christ informs your understanding of God's nature and attributes. How can you share biblical truth with those who have been influenced by alternative beliefs? Seek opportunities to engage in respectful conversations that allow for an exploration of these important questions while remaining firmly grounded in biblical teachings.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/The Identity of God/The Faulty Assumptions"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Unveiling the Triune God: The Mystery of God in Three Persons</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/god-in-three-persons/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-09-04T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-09-04T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-09-04:/god-in-three-persons/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;God in Three Persons&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we talk about God as being in three persons, we are not saying that the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit are human beings. Instead, we use the term "persons" to describe their personhood or personality. This means that each of them has intellect, emotion, and volition. Any being with rationality, emotion, and a will can be considered a person, whether human beings, angelic beings, or the Divine Being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's important to note that the term "person" does not include physicality because human beings continue to exist as persons even after death. While their bodies decay, their true selves, their personhood, continue to exist in either heaven or hell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Distinct Persons of the Trinity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we speak of God existing in three persons, we mean that God's existence is made up of three distinct centers of intellect, emotion, and will. Each person of the Trinity has a unique role in creation and in the salvation of mankind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Father: The Father is one of the persons of the Trinity. He is not the Son or the Holy Spirit. Jesus often prayed to the Father, showing that they are distinct persons (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/23/Luke-23-34.html"&gt;Luke 23:34&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; Consider how Jesus' prayers to the Father demonstrate a relationship between distinct persons within the Trinity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Son: The Son is another person of the Trinity. He is not the Father or the Holy Spirit. Jesus is fully God and fully man and played a unique role in our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; Reflect on how Jesus being fully God and fully man allows Him to bridge the gap between humanity and divinity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VM2UE6MIKzM" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Holy Spirit: The Holy Spirit is also a distinct person of the Trinity. He is not the Father or the Son. The Holy Spirit proceeds from both the Father and the Son and has a unique role in guiding and empowering believers (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/15/John-15-26.html"&gt;John 15:26&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; Consider how the Holy Spirit's role as a guide and empowerer impacts your relationship with God.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Unity of the Trinity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the three persons of the Trinity are distinct, they are united as one God. They share the same nature and essence, and they are all the same God. This unity is crucial for several reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Love: God is love (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-John/4/1-John-4-8.html"&gt;1 John 4:8&lt;/a&gt;). However, before God created any other being, could He have truly been love? Love requires someone to be loved. Because God exists in three co-equal, co-eternal persons, love exists too. The Father, Son, and Spirit have always loved each other, making love eternal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Understanding that God exists in three persons helps us grasp the eternal nature of love within the Trinity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Community: The Trinity provides a model of perfect community and relationship. The Father, Son, and Holy Spirit have eternally existed in perfect harmony, demonstrating the importance of unity and relationship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Seeing the perfect community within the Trinity encourages us to prioritize unity and relationships in our own lives.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Redemption: The distinct roles of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit in salvation highlight the depth of God's love for humanity. Each person played a unique part in our redemption, showcasing God's multifaceted nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Recognizing the distinct roles within the Trinity helps us appreciate the comprehensive work of God in our salvation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, when we talk about God in three persons, we refer to the distinct personhood or personality of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. Each person of the Trinity has intellect, emotion, and volition. While they are distinct from one another, they are united as one God, sharing the same nature and essence. The Trinity provides a model of perfect love, community, and redemption, demonstrating the multifaceted nature of God's character. Understanding the Trinity deepens our understanding of God's eternal love and invites us to prioritize unity and relationships in our own lives.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/The Nature of God/The Trinity"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>LORD GOD: Unveiling the Majesty and Grace</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/lord-god-lord-god/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-09-04T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-09-04T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-09-04:/lord-god-lord-god/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Lord God&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Understanding the different titles used for God in the Bible can be quite confusing. Different Bible translations may use these terms differently, adding to the complexity. One common title used in place of God's Hebrew name is "LORD." This is done to follow the tradition of the Israelites, who refrained from pronouncing or spelling out God's name. In English translations of the Old Testament, when God's Hebrew name "YHWH" is used, it is usually replaced with "LORD" in all caps or small caps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ancient Hebrew did not include vowels in its written form, so there is uncertainty around how God's name should be pronounced or spelled. It could be Yahweh, Jehovah, Yehowah, or something else entirely. The consistent use of "LORD" as a replacement for "YHWH" in English translations helps maintain this tradition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Old Testament, another title used for God is "Lord," which usually translates the Hebrew word "Adonai." This title emphasizes God's lordship. Throughout various English translations of the Bible, "LORD/YHWH" and "Lord/Adonai" are the most common renderings. When "Lord GOD" or "Lord GOD" occurs, it usually represents the dual name for God, "Adonai YHWH." Additionally, other names like "YHWH Sabaoth" (rendered as "Lord of Hosts") and "YHWH Shaddai" (rendered as "LORD Almighty") are used to refer to different aspects of God's character and attributes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The usage of "Lord" and "God" in the New Testament is less complicated. In almost all instances, "God" is a translation of the Greek word "theos," which refers to deity. Similarly, "Lord" is a translation of the Greek word "kurios," which denotes a master. Regardless of the specific terms used, it is vital to always show reverence to God and His name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yJEcb2qb9Yg" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Understanding the various titles used for God in the Bible helps us grasp different aspects of His character and attributes. It reminds us that God is not limited to a single name or title but reveals Himself through different names and titles to highlight specific aspects of who He is. Recognizing this enhances our understanding of God's nature and deepens our relationship with Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider how you refer to God in your prayers and conversations. Do you primarily use a specific title or name? Understanding the significance of various titles for God can help you appreciate His multifaceted nature and develop a richer vocabulary when communicating with Him.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/The Identity of God/The Names of God"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Finding Peace: Overcoming Anger with God Through Faith</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/angry-with-god/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-09-03T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-09-03T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-09-03:/angry-with-god/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Angry with God&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When something tragic happens in our lives, it is natural for us to ask God, "Why?" We may find ourselves angry with God, questioning why He allowed the tragedy to occur. This anger stems from two flawed ways of thinking. First, we may believe that life should be easy and that God should prevent unpleasant circumstances from happening to us. When He doesn't, we get angry with Him. Second, when we don't fully comprehend God's sovereignty, we lose confidence in His ability to control everything, including the events that impact our lives. This lack of understanding can lead to frustration and anger toward God. However, it's important to remember that our anger at God is often rooted in our own human limitations and desire for control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tragedies serve as a reminder that we are not in control. As much as we may try to influence outcomes, it is ultimately God who is in charge of His creation. Every event that occurs is either caused or allowed by God. Even the smallest details do not escape His notice (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/10/Matthew-10-29.html"&gt;Matthew 10:29-31&lt;/a&gt;). While we may complain and get angry, blaming God for our circumstances, it is important to trust Him and surrender our bitterness and pain to Him. Acknowledging our own prideful desire to impose our will over His can grant us His peace and strength to navigate through difficult situations (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-Corinthians/10/1-Corinthians-10-13.html"&gt;1 Corinthians 10:13&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sxJYjF0zLhU" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our understanding of God's sovereignty must be accompanied by an understanding of His other attributes such as love, mercy, kindness, goodness, righteousness, justice, and holiness. When we view our difficulties through the lens of God's Word, we begin to see them in a different light. Scripture assures us that our loving and holy God works all things together for our good (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/8/Romans-8-28.html"&gt;Romans 8:28&lt;/a&gt;). He has a perfect plan and purpose for us that cannot be thwarted (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/14/Isaiah-14-24.html"&gt;Isaiah 14:24&lt;/a&gt;, 46:9-10). It is essential to recognize that this life is not meant to be devoid of trouble. Job reminds us that "man is born to trouble as surely as sparks fly upward" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Job/5/Job-5-7.html"&gt;Job 5:7&lt;/a&gt;), and that life is short and "full of trouble" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Job/14/Job-14-1.html"&gt;Job 14:1&lt;/a&gt;). Following Christ does not guarantee a life free from problems. In fact, Jesus Himself said, "In this world you will have trouble," but He also reassured us that He has "overcome the world" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/16/John-16-33.html"&gt;John 16:33&lt;/a&gt;). Through Him, we can find peace amidst the storms of life (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/14/John-14-27.html"&gt;John 14:27&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to note that inappropriate anger is sinful (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Galatians/5/Galatians-5-20.html"&gt;Galatians 5:20&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Ephesians/4/Ephesians-4-26.html"&gt;Ephesians 4:26-27&lt;/a&gt;, 31; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Colossians/3/Colossians-3-8.html"&gt;Colossians 3:8&lt;/a&gt;). Ungodly anger can be self-destructive, give the devil a foothold in our lives, and rob us of joy and peace. Holding onto anger can breed bitterness and resentment in our hearts. Instead, we must confess our anger to the Lord and release it to Him. It is crucial to approach God in prayer during times of grief, anger, and pain. David serves as an example in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/2-Samuel/12/2-Samuel-12-15.html"&gt;2 Samuel 12:15-23&lt;/a&gt; when he fervently prayed for his sick baby's survival. Even when the baby passed away, David worshiped the Lord and proclaimed that he would someday be reunited with his child in God's presence. David cried out to God during his baby's illness and worshiped Him afterward. This demonstrates the importance of pouring out our hearts to God and being honest about our feelings. He knows our hearts, so there is no need to hide anything from Him. By expressing ourselves humbly before Him, we allow Him to work through us and shape us into His likeness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, we must ask ourselves if we can trust God with everything, including our lives and the lives of our loved ones. The answer is a resounding yes! Our God is compassionate, full of grace and love. As disciples of Christ, we can trust Him with all things. When tragedies occur, we can trust that God can use them to draw us closer to Him and strengthen our faith, leading us to maturity and completeness (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/34/Psalm-34-18.html"&gt;Psalm 34:18&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/James/1/James-1-2.html"&gt;James 1:2-4&lt;/a&gt;). Through our experiences, we can become a testimony of comfort to others (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/2-Corinthians/1/2-Corinthians-1-3.html"&gt;2 Corinthians 1:3-5&lt;/a&gt;). However, this is not an easy process. It requires daily surrendering of our own will to His, faithful study of His attributes as revealed in His Word, consistent prayer, and practical application of what we learn to our own situations. By doing so, our faith will gradually grow and mature, equipping us to trust Him through future tragedies that are sure to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary, it is important to recognize that being angry with God is not justified. Anger at God often stems from an inability or unwillingness to trust Him even when we don't understand His ways. Instead of directing our anger towards God, we should pour out our hearts to Him in prayer and trust that He is in control of His perfect plan.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/Our Response to God/Honest Questions"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Divine Transformation: Understanding How God Changes His Mind</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/god-change-mind/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-09-03T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-09-03T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-09-03:/god-change-mind/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;God Does Not Change&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bible tells us that God does not change. In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Malachi/3/Malachi-3-6.html"&gt;Malachi 3:6&lt;/a&gt;, it says, "I the LORD do not change. So you, O descendants of Jacob, are not destroyed." This verse emphasizes the immutability of God. Similarly, &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/James/1/James-1-17.html"&gt;James 1:17&lt;/a&gt; states, "Every good and perfect …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;God Does Not Change&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bible tells us that God does not change. In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Malachi/3/Malachi-3-6.html"&gt;Malachi 3:6&lt;/a&gt;, it says, "I the LORD do not change. So you, O descendants of Jacob, are not destroyed." This verse emphasizes the immutability of God. Similarly, &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/James/1/James-1-17.html"&gt;James 1:17&lt;/a&gt; states, "Every good and perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of the heavenly lights, who does not change like shifting shadows." These verses make it clear that God is unchanging and unchangeable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to understand that when we talk about God changing His mind, it does not mean that He realizes a mistake and tries a different approach. That would imply a lack of wisdom on God's part. Instead, we need to interpret these passages in light of the overall biblical teaching on the nature of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Anthropopathism: Understanding God's Feelings&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are verses in the Bible that seem to suggest that God changes His mind. For example, &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/6/Genesis-6-6.html"&gt;Genesis 6:6&lt;/a&gt; says, "The LORD was grieved that He had made man on the earth, and His heart was filled with pain." &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Exodus/32/Exodus-32-14.html"&gt;Exodus 32:14&lt;/a&gt; also states, "Then the LORD relented and did not bring on His people the disaster He had threatened." These passages use anthropopathism, which is a figure of speech where human emotions and thought processes are attributed to God. It helps us understand God's work from a human perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/6/Genesis-6-6.html"&gt;Genesis 6:6&lt;/a&gt;, when it says that God was grieved over making man, it doesn't mean that He regretted creating humanity. It is an anthropomorphic expression to convey God's sorrow over man's sin. We are alive today because God did not change His mind about creating us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conditional Declarations vs. Determinations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To further understand passages where it seems like God changes His mind, we need to differentiate between declarations and determinations of God. Declarations are statements that depend on our response, while determinations are unconditional promises or prophecies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HYAtepiTod8" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, in the story of Jonah, God declared through His prophet that He would destroy Nineveh in forty days. However, when the people of Nineveh repented, God relented from bringing judgment upon them. This apparent change of mind was not a contradiction of God's immutability. It was a conditional declaration given to provoke repentance, and it achieved its purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An example of an unconditional determination is God's promise to David that his house and kingdom would endure forever (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/2-Samuel/7/2-Samuel-7-16.html"&gt;2 Samuel 7:16&lt;/a&gt;). There was no qualification or condition attached to this promise. Regardless of what David did or didn't do, God's word would come to pass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Consistency of God&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God's consistency is a vital aspect of His character. When we observe apparent changes in God's treatment or response to us, it does not mean that His character has changed. In fact, because God does not change, He treats the righteous and the unrighteous differently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If someone repents, God consistently forgives. Conversely, if someone refuses to repent, God consistently judges. His nature, plan, and being remain constant. He cannot be pleased with the contrite one day and angry with them the next. That would make Him mutable and untrustworthy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we see instances like God warning Nineveh of judgment and then sparing them after their repentance, it may seem like He changed His mind. However, in reality, God is staying true to His character. He loves mercy and forgives the penitent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Our Relationship with God&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At one point, we were all enemies of God due to our sin (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/8/Romans-8-7.html"&gt;Romans 8:7&lt;/a&gt;). But when we repented and trusted in Christ for salvation, God "changed His mind" about us. We are no longer enemies but His beloved children (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/1/John-1-12.html"&gt;John 1:12&lt;/a&gt;). This transformation demonstrates that God does not change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our salvation does not mean that God changed; rather, it shows that He acted consistently with His character. Had He not saved us for the sake of Christ, He would have acted contrary to His nature. The fact that God warned us about the consequences of sin and then offered forgiveness through repentance is a testimony to God's unchanging love and mercy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding that God does not change is crucial for our faith and trust in Him. It assures us that His promises are secure and His character is reliable. We can have confidence in His immutability, knowing that He will consistently respond to our choices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recognizing that some passages use anthropopathism helps us grasp the depth of God's emotions and thoughts without attributing human limitations to Him. It allows us to see things from a human perspective while acknowledging the infinite nature of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Think About It&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider how your understanding of God's immutability affects your trust in Him. Reflect on how knowing that God does not change impacts your relationship with Him. How does the fact that God consistently responds to our choices reflect His character? Take time to meditate on these truths and let them deepen your faith in an unchanging God.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/The Character of God/Anthropomorphism"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Divine Love Unveiled: Understanding God''s Omnibenevolence</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/god-omnibenevolent/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-09-02T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-09-02T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-09-02:/god-omnibenevolent/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;God: The Omnibenevolent Being&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we talk about God being omnibenevolent, we are referring to the belief that God is completely and perfectly good in every aspect of His being. The term "omnibenevolent" stems from the Latin words "omni," meaning "all," and "benevolent," meaning "good" or "charitable."

&lt;p&gt;When we talk about God being omnibenevolent, we are referring to the belief that God is completely and perfectly good in every aspect of His being. The term "omnibenevolent" stems from the Latin words "omni," meaning "all," and "benevolent," meaning "good" or "charitable." Essentially, it means that God is all-good, and there is no part of Him that is not purely good. While human beings can do good things, only God is truly omnibenevolent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Perfection of God's Goodness&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To understand omnibenevolence fully, we must also consider God's other attributes, such as His omniscience (all-knowing) and omnipotence (all-powerful). If God is a perfect being who is completely self-sustaining and independent of any need, then He must also be perfectly good. If God were merely a good and powerful being but not entirely good, it would imply an element of contingency. In other words, we could conceive of a being with potentially greater benevolence, making that being greater than God Himself. Since the goodness of anything is measured by its perfection, God must be perfectly good to be considered omniscient and omnipotent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Problem of Evil&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1gZMaZ4AJJI" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One common objection to the concept of God's omnibenevolence, along with His omnipotence and omniscience, is the problem of evil. How can there be evil in the world if God is all-knowing, all-powerful, and perfectly good? This question has been debated by philosophers for centuries. Some propose that evil originated from Lucifer's rebellion and subsequently from humanity's free will choices. They argue that evil was not caused by God but rather by the misuse of free will. However, this raises another question: Why did God create beings capable of choosing evil? The answer often provided is that God desired beings who could make choices, as He did not want to create mere robots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Bible and God's Goodness&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we examine the Bible, it consistently presents God as wholly good. Jesus Himself proclaimed that no one is truly good except God (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/10/Mark-10-18.html"&gt;Mark 10:18&lt;/a&gt;). Numerous testimonies in Scripture affirm God's goodness (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/106/Psalm-106-1.html"&gt;Psalm 106:1&lt;/a&gt;; 135:3; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Nahum/1/Nahum-1-7.html"&gt;Nahum 1:7&lt;/a&gt;). The message of salvation through Christ is described as "good news" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/2/Luke-2-10.html"&gt;Luke 2:10&lt;/a&gt;), and the revelation of Christ is referred to as "the goodness and loving kindness of God our Savior" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Titus/3/Titus-3-4.html"&gt;Titus 3:4&lt;/a&gt;, ESV). In fact, it is God's goodness that leads us to repentance (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/2/Romans-2-4.html"&gt;Romans 2:4&lt;/a&gt;). The indwelling Spirit of God produces goodness in our lives (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Galatians/5/Galatians-5-22.html"&gt;Galatians 5:22&lt;/a&gt;), and God brings goodness to fruition in our lives through faith (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/2-Thessalonians/1/2-Thessalonians-1-11.html"&gt;2 Thessalonians 1:11&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding God's omnibenevolence has significant implications for our relationship with Him. It assures us that every aspect of His being is characterized by perfect goodness. This means that we can trust Him completely, knowing that His intentions and actions toward us are always motivated by love and goodness. Recognizing God's omnibenevolence also helps us navigate the problem of evil, as we can have confidence that He is not the author of evil but rather the source of all goodness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider the implications of a God who is not omnibenevolent. Would you feel comfortable placing your trust in a being who had the potential to be more benevolent than they currently are? How does the concept of God's omnibenevolence impact your understanding of His character? Take time to reflect on how this attribute of God's goodness influences your relationship with Him and your perspective on the problem of evil.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/The Character of God/God’s Love"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Ultimate Comparison: Hitler vs Saddam - Lessons for Christian Faith</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/hitler-saddam/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-09-02T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-09-02T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-09-02:/hitler-saddam/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;God's Sovereignty over Rulers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Bible, it is clear that God is sovereign over everything, including the rulers of nations. This means that He is ultimately in control of all things, big and small. The Bible tells us that God is in control of the weather (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/148/Psalm-148-8.html"&gt;Psalm 148:8 …&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;God's Sovereignty over Rulers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Bible, it is clear that God is sovereign over everything, including the rulers of nations. This means that He is ultimately in control of all things, big and small. The Bible tells us that God is in control of the weather (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/148/Psalm-148-8.html"&gt;Psalm 148:8&lt;/a&gt;), life and death (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/104/Psalm-104-29.html"&gt;Psalm 104:29-30&lt;/a&gt;), and even seemingly inconsequential happenings (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Proverbs/16/Proverbs-16-33.html"&gt;Proverbs 16:33&lt;/a&gt;). His sovereignty extends to the rulers of nations as well. The book of Daniel tells us that God sets up kings and deposes them, and He has the power to change times and seasons (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Daniel/2/Daniel-2-20.html"&gt;Daniel 2:20-21&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One example of God's sovereignty over rulers is seen in the life of Cyrus the Great. God called Cyrus by name and promised to set him on the throne of Persia one hundred and fifty years before his birth (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/45/Isaiah-45-13.html"&gt;Isaiah 45:13&lt;/a&gt;). This shows that God had a plan for Cyrus, a pagan ruler, and used him for His purposes. The book of Romans also affirms God's sovereignty over rulers, stating that there is no authority except that which God has established (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/13/Romans-13-1.html"&gt;Romans 13:1&lt;/a&gt;). This statement was written during the time of Nero, a wicked ruler who persecuted Christians. Despite Nero's evil actions, Paul did not question why God allowed him to be in power. Instead, he recognized that all authorities are established by God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding God's sovereignty over rulers helps us to trust in His plan even when we see evil leaders in positions of authority. It reminds us that nothing happens without God's knowledge and permission. It also encourages us to pray for our leaders, knowing that ultimately their actions are subject to God's control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If God is sovereign over rulers, how does this impact our responsibility as citizens? How should we respond when we disagree with the actions of our leaders? How can we pray for our rulers in light of God's sovereignty?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;God's Purpose in Allowing Evil Rulers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it may be difficult to understand why God allows evil rulers to come into power, the Bible provides some insights into His purposes. At times, God has used evil rulers to bring judgment on His people and to bring them back to righteousness. For example, God raised up Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon to punish Judah for their idolatry (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/2-Kings/20/2-Kings-20-17.html"&gt;2 Kings 20:17-18&lt;/a&gt;). However, it is important to note that all rulers are accountable to God for their actions. Babylon, for instance, was later judged for its own wickedness (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/13/Isaiah-13-19.html"&gt;Isaiah 13:19&lt;/a&gt;; 14:4), and Nebuchadnezzar himself faced individual judgment (Daniel 4).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assyria is another example of a nation that God allowed to rise for a purpose but later judged for its pride and cruelty (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/10/Isaiah-10-5.html"&gt;Isaiah 10:5-19&lt;/a&gt;). These examples remind us that while God may use evil rulers for His purposes, there will be a day of reckoning for their actions. Human rulers are not omnipotent or eternal, and they are not immune from punishment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding God's purpose in allowing evil rulers helps us to trust that He has a greater plan beyond our understanding. It also reminds us that no ruler is beyond the reach of God's justice and judgment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z9Ibc_1Hm_U" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Think About It:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How does knowing that God will hold rulers accountable impact our perspective on justice in this world? How can we find hope and comfort in the knowledge that there will be a day of reckoning for those who have abused their power?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Role of Evil Rulers in the Expansion of the Church&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some instances, evil rulers have inadvertently played a role in the growth and spread of the church. The early church faced persecution from governing authorities, which led to the scattering of believers and the spread of the gospel. Acts 8 recounts how a persecution against the early church in Jerusalem resulted in believers being scattered throughout Judea and Samaria (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Acts/8/Acts-8-1.html"&gt;Acts 8:1&lt;/a&gt;). This dispersion contributed to the fulfillment of the Great Commission and the growth of the church.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While persecution is never God's desired plan for His people, He can use difficult circumstances and evil rulers to accomplish His purposes. The example of the early church reminds us that even in the face of opposition, God can bring about good and advance His kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding how God can work through difficult circumstances and evil rulers encourages us to trust His plan even in times of persecution. It reminds us that God can bring beauty out of brokenness and use even the darkest situations for His glory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How does knowing that God can use evil rulers for His purposes impact our response to persecution? How can we find hope and encouragement in the knowledge that God is still at work even in the midst of difficult circumstances?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Accountability of Evil Rulers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although God allows evil rulers to come into power, they are not exempt from accountability. The Bible teaches that all rulers will be held responsible for their actions. Ultimately, those who die in their sins will face eternal punishment in hell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is worth noting that eternity in hell is not limited to specific individuals like Hitler or Saddam Hussein. Rather, it is a fate that awaits all who reject Christ and abuse the people of God. While we may not fully comprehend why God allows evil rulers to exist or why they are not immediately judged, we can trust that there will be a day when justice will be served.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the accountability of evil rulers reminds us that no one is above God's judgment. It also reinforces the importance of our own personal accountability before God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How does the accountability of evil rulers affect our own understanding of justice? How can we find comfort and hope in the knowledge that God will ultimately bring justice to all?&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/God and Evil/War and Disasters"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Unmasking the Cosmic Killjoy: Unlocking Joy and Freedom in Christ</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/cosmic-killjoy/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-09-01T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-09-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-09-01:/cosmic-killjoy/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Cosmic Killjoy: Understanding God's Character&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we think of God, we may sometimes imagine Him as a strict, joyless figure who is constantly pointing out our faults and stifling any sense of pleasure or fun. This view of God as a cosmic killjoy is not only sad but also completely unbiblical. The God of the Bible is far from being a cold, disagreeable sourpuss. In fact, He is the one who restores us and gives us true joy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;God's Desire for Fullness of Life&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus Himself declared that He came so that we may have life to the full (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/10/John-10-10.html"&gt;John 10:10&lt;/a&gt;). This does not align with the image of a killjoy. Throughout the Bible, we see examples of what a life filled with joy looks like. One great example is the life of Jesus Himself. His first miracle was performed at a wedding feast, demonstrating that He valued celebration and joy (John 2). Children were drawn to Him, which suggests that He was not joyless but rather exhibited joy in His interactions with them (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/10/Mark-10-13.html"&gt;Mark 10:13-16&lt;/a&gt;). In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/7/Luke-7-34.html"&gt;Luke 7:34&lt;/a&gt;, Jesus even addresses the criticism that He was a glutton and a drunkard, highlighting His participation in life and His enjoyment of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;God Delights in Us and Provides Pleasure&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contrary to being a killjoy, God takes pleasure in things. In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Zephaniah/3/Zephaniah-3-17.html"&gt;Zephaniah 3:17&lt;/a&gt;, it is stated that God delights in us and even sings over us. He finds delight in His obedient children (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Deuteronomy/30/Deuteronomy-30-9.html"&gt;Deuteronomy 30:9&lt;/a&gt;) and delights in showing mercy (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Micah/7/Micah-7-18.html"&gt;Micah 7:18&lt;/a&gt;). Furthermore, God created the human body with the capacity to experience pleasure. Taste buds were part of His design, along with a wide variety of flavorful foods to satisfy our palates. The human eye was intricately designed by God to appreciate the beauty and wonder of colors. Additionally, God also designed the sexual organs, with their countless nerve endings, so that a married couple can experience the pleasure of their love. Pleasure was God's idea, demonstrating that He is far from being a killjoy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Celebrations and Festivals&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Old Testament is filled with instructions for celebrations and festivals. These feasts served as important reminders of God's faithfulness and provided glimpses of who the Messiah would be. They were also times of outright celebration, which would not be the case if God were a killjoy. These feasts were opportunities for God's people to come together, enjoy good food, and experience joy in His presence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Joy in Serving and Creativity&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, as Christians, we may mistakenly believe that joy can only be found in reading the Bible, meditating, or serving others. While it is true that we can experience joy in these activities, joy is not limited to them alone. God created us to experience fellowship, recreation, and creativity. We were made to delight in being His children, using the skills He has given us, and welcoming the pleasures He offers. The Westminster Shorter Catechism correctly states that "Man's chief end is to glorify God and enjoy him forever." This means that our purpose is not solely focused on reading the Bible or serving but also on finding joy in all aspects of life that are aligned with God's will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Understanding Boundaries&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to note that while God provides us with many sources of joy and pleasure, there are certain types of "pleasure" that He opposes. The sad truth is that we live in a fallen world where what society often deems pleasurable may not be pleasing to God. Activities such as promiscuous sex or drunkenness are not condoned by God (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Galatians/5/Galatians-5-19.html"&gt;Galatians 5:19-21&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Colossians/3/Colossians-3-5.html"&gt;Colossians 3:5-10&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-Corinthians/6/1-Corinthians-6-12.html"&gt;1 Corinthians 6:12-17&lt;/a&gt;). It is in our best interest to avoid pursuing these worldly pleasures, as they are not conducive to long-term joy and often leave us empty. Rather than being a killjoy, God is actually protecting us and providing what is truly best for us. This can be compared to an earthly parent who sets boundaries for their children's well-being. Though the children may see the parent as a killjoy for limiting their candy consumption, the boundaries ultimately benefit them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bbd-hRlCux8" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Focusing on the Giver, Not Just the Gift&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it is important to appreciate and enjoy the good things that God provides, we must remember that the purpose of our lives is not solely to seek pleasure. Our lives have deep meaning, and we were created to delight in God Himself (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/37/Psalm-37-4.html"&gt;Psalm 37:4&lt;/a&gt;). The focus should be on the Giver, not just the gifts. God is not a killjoy; in fact, He is the source of true joy. His Spirit produces joy in our lives (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Galatians/5/Galatians-5-22.html"&gt;Galatians 5:22&lt;/a&gt;). Any pursuit of pleasure apart from God can lead to idolatry. God opposes our pursuit of worldly and temporary joy because He knows it is not ultimately beneficial for us. Sometimes, we need to put aside instant gratification in order to invest in the greater joy found in God's kingdom. As &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/16/Psalm-16-11.html"&gt;Psalm 16:11&lt;/a&gt; reminds us, "You will fill me with joy in your presence, with eternal pleasures at your right hand."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding God's character as one who desires our joy and fullness of life is crucial for our relationship with Him. It helps us realize that He is not a killjoy but rather a loving Father who wants what is best for His children. By embracing this truth, we can experience true joy and find contentment in living according to His design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does the idea of God as a cosmic killjoy affect your perception of Him?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In what ways can you seek joy and find pleasure in activities that align with God's will?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reflect on moments when you have experienced true joy in your relationship with God or in living according to His principles. How did these experiences differ from temporary pleasures?&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it comes to the topic of whether God forgets, there are several passages in the Bible that indicate God's forgiveness of our sins. For instance, &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/43/Isaiah-43-25.html"&gt;Isaiah 43:25&lt;/a&gt; says, “I, even I, am he who blots out your transgressions, for my own sake, and remembers your …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Does God Forget?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to the topic of whether God forgets, there are several passages in the Bible that indicate God's forgiveness of our sins. For instance, &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/43/Isaiah-43-25.html"&gt;Isaiah 43:25&lt;/a&gt; says, “I, even I, am he who blots out your transgressions, for my own sake, and remembers your sins no more.” Additionally, Hebrews 10 explains how Jesus' sacrifice on the cross for sin was a once-and-for-all sacrifice. Unlike the sacrificial system of the Old Testament, in which sacrifices were continually made for sin, Jesus paid for sin completely. &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/10/Hebrews-10-14.html"&gt;Hebrews 10:14&lt;/a&gt;–18 states, “For by one sacrifice he has made perfect forever those who are being made holy. The Holy Spirit also testifies to us about this. First he says: ‘This is the covenant I will make with them after that time, says the Lord. I will put my laws in their hearts, and I will write them on their minds.’ Then he adds: ‘Their sins and lawless acts I will remember no more.’ And where these have been forgiven, sacrifice for sin is no longer necessary.” These passages make it clear that God does not remember our sins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, it's important to note that God's "not remembering" is not the same as human forgetfulness. God is omniscient and knows everything; He does not forget anything. Instead, when the Bible talks about God not remembering our sins, it means that He chooses not to bring them up or hold them against us. In human relationships, we can choose to remember the offenses someone has committed against us or choose to forget. To forgive someone, we often need to put painful memories out of our minds. Forgiveness allows us to move forward without dwelling on past troubles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/l42NpoAdJQ8" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than treating us as our sins deserve, God removes our sins from us as far as the east is from the west—an immeasurable distance (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/103/Psalm-103-12.html"&gt;Psalm 103:12&lt;/a&gt;). Think of traveling around the globe. When do you stop going east and start going west? It is impossible to say. When we are saved, our sins are completely forgiven. This is what the writer of Hebrews is talking about—Jesus made a one-time sacrifice that completely removes our sin. In Christ, we are justified (declared righteous) before God. &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/8/Romans-8-1.html"&gt;Romans 8:1&lt;/a&gt; tells us there is no condemnation for those who are in Christ. &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/8/Romans-8-31.html"&gt;Romans 8:31&lt;/a&gt;–39 beautifully discusses our security in Christ. Sin has no say in our standing with God. We are fully accepted and declared righteous in Him. God does not remember our sins in the way He treats us; instead, He treats us as righteous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even as Christians, we still sin, but we know that God is faithful to forgive us when we confess our sins (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-John/1/1-John-1-9.html"&gt;1 John 1:9&lt;/a&gt;). God cleanses us, and then He moves on. He does not hold our sins over us. Instead, He frees us from the slavery of sin and sets us free to experience a new life in Him. Knowing the complete forgiveness of God in Christ, we can join King Hezekiah in praising our Redeemer: “You have put all my sins behind your back” (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/38/Isaiah-38-17.html"&gt;Isaiah 38:17&lt;/a&gt;). Like Paul, we can forget what is behind and press on toward the goal to win the prize for which God has called us heavenward in Christ Jesus (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Philippians/3/Philippians-3-13.html"&gt;Philippians 3:13&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding that God forgives and does not remember our sins has significant implications for our relationship with Him and how we view ourselves. It means that once we have confessed our sins and received forgiveness through faith in Jesus Christ, there is no longer any condemnation for us (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/8/Romans-8-1.html"&gt;Romans 8:1&lt;/a&gt;). We can have confidence that we are completely forgiven and accepted by God. This knowledge should bring us great comfort and peace, knowing that our past sins do not define us or separate us from God's love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, understanding God's forgiveness should also shape how we relate to others. Just as God chooses not to remember our sins, we are called to forgive others and let go of their offenses against us. Forgiveness allows us to experience healing, restoration, and reconciliation in our relationships. It frees us from the burden of holding onto resentment and bitterness. The example set by God's forgiveness should inspire us to extend the same grace and mercy to others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does understanding God's forgiveness impact your view of yourself and your relationship with Him?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In what ways can you apply the concept of forgiveness in your relationships with others?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reflect on the freedom and peace that comes from knowing that God does not hold your past sins against you.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The concept of omnificence refers to the ability to create all things, possessing unlimited power to bring forth existence. In the Bible, the first verse of Genesis affirms God's omnificence: "In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth." This divine …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;God's Omnificence: The Power to Create All Things&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept of omnificence refers to the ability to create all things, possessing unlimited power to bring forth existence. In the Bible, the first verse of Genesis affirms God's omnificence: "In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth." This divine attribute is also emphasized in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Colossians/1/Colossians-1-15.html"&gt;Colossians 1:15&lt;/a&gt;–17, which speaks of Jesus, the second Person of the Trinity, as the image of the invisible God and affirms that all things were created through Him and for Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God's omnificence stems from His omnipotence, which denotes His infinite power. Scripture attests that God is stronger and more powerful than any created being or object. &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Job/37/Job-37-23.html"&gt;Job 37:23&lt;/a&gt; states, "The Almighty is beyond our reach and exalted in power; in his justice and great righteousness, he does not oppress." In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Jeremiah/32/Jeremiah-32-17.html"&gt;Jeremiah 32:17&lt;/a&gt;, it is acknowledged that God made the heavens and the earth by His great power and outstretched arm, with nothing being too hard for Him. Thus, God possesses the power to do all things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another attribute closely related to God's omnificence is His omniscience, which characterizes Him as infinite in knowledge. In the act of creation, God's omniscience worked hand in hand with His omnificence. &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Proverbs/3/Proverbs-3-19.html"&gt;Proverbs 3:19&lt;/a&gt; reveals that by wisdom the Lord laid the earth's foundations and by understanding He set the heavens in place. Being omnificent, having created all things, naturally equips God with comprehensive knowledge. First &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/3/John-3-20.html"&gt;John 3:20&lt;/a&gt; asserts that God is greater than our hearts and knows all things. &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/46/Isaiah-46-10.html"&gt;Isaiah 46:10&lt;/a&gt; further elucidates that God knows the future as well as the past, making known the end from the beginning. Even our thoughts are known to Him before they are formed: "Before a word is on my tongue you, LORD, know it completely" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/139/Psalm-139-4.html"&gt;Psalm 139:4&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bible unveils numerous other attributes of God, many of which find expression in His creative work. &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/1/Romans-1-20.html"&gt;Romans 1:20&lt;/a&gt; affirms that since the creation of the world, God's invisible qualities—His eternal power and divine nature—have been clearly seen and understood through what has been made. Psalm 104 is a psalm replete with praise for our omnificent God. It marvels at the multitude of His works and acknowledges the wisdom displayed in their creation. The psalm extols the creation of light, clouds, wind, seas, mountains, valleys, beasts of the field, birds of the sky, trees, sun and moon, and the very rhythm of life. All these serve as testaments to God's omnificence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NjZPqX5Gdns" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/40/Psalm-40-5.html"&gt;Psalm 40:5&lt;/a&gt; contemplates the depth of God's omnificence and acknowledges that His wonders are too numerous to declare: "Many, LORD my God, are the wonders you have done. . . . None can compare with you; were I to speak and tell of your deeds, they would be too many to declare." God's creative power is limitless and surpasses our ability to fully comprehend. He is our omnificent Creator, Sustainer, and the sole source of eternal life. &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Acts/17/Acts-17-28.html"&gt;Acts 17:28&lt;/a&gt; encapsulates this truth by stating that in Him we live, move, and have our being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding God's omnificence is vital because it reminds us of His unmatched power and authority over all creation. Recognizing that everything around us is a product of His divine creativity deepens our appreciation for His greatness. Moreover, comprehending God's omniscience reveals His intimate knowledge of us and His meticulous involvement in our lives. This understanding fosters a sense of awe and reverence towards our Creator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reflect on the complexity and diversity of creation. How does the reality of God's omnificence impact your perception of His creative work?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consider the implications of God's omniscience for your life. How does knowing that God knows you completely and is involved in every aspect of your existence affect your relationship with Him?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Meditate on the fact that God's power and knowledge are far beyond human comprehension. How does this deepen your trust in Him and His plans for your life?&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Salvation is a central concept in the Christian faith. It is the deliverance of humanity from sin and eternal separation from God. However, there is a common misconception that God creates people who are doomed to hell. This article seeks to clarify this misunderstanding and shed light on the role of human choice in salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1. The Wrath of God&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the book of Romans, we see the progression of those who reject Christ. The wrath of God is revealed against the unrighteous because they choose to reject the Creator and worship created things (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/1/Romans-1-18.html"&gt;Romans 1:18&lt;/a&gt;–20). People exchange the glory of God for created things, leading to a downward spiral of sin (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/1/Romans-1-23.html"&gt;Romans 1:23&lt;/a&gt;–25). This spiral is characterized by various sins that all of us can relate to (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/1/Romans-1-28.html"&gt;Romans 1:28&lt;/a&gt;–31). Furthermore, not only do people participate in these sins, but they also approve of those who do them (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/1/Romans-1-32.html"&gt;Romans 1:32&lt;/a&gt;). In the end, everyone stands condemned before God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Understanding the consequences of rejecting God's authority helps us recognize the need for salvation and motivates us to seek a relationship with Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; Reflect on your own life and consider areas where you may have exchanged the glory of God for worldly pursuits. How can you redirect your focus back to Him?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2. The Conviction of Conscience&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God has given every person a conscience that convicts them of their sin (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/2/Romans-2-14.html"&gt;Romans 2:14&lt;/a&gt;–15). Our conscience serves as an internal moral compass, revealing right from wrong. It reminds us that there is a higher standard and that we fall short of it. Therefore, no one has an excuse for their actions or their rejection of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Recognizing our conscience as a gift from God helps us understand the universal moral law He has placed within us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; Reflect on times when your conscience has convicted you of your actions. How does this point to the existence and authority of God?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;3. The Choice to Believe&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus Christ came into the world so that we may believe in Him and have eternal life (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/20/John-20-31.html"&gt;John 20:31&lt;/a&gt;). Through His life, death, and resurrection, Jesus paid the price for our sins and made a way for us to be reconciled with God. However, it is our responsibility to make the choice to believe in Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God allows people to be born so that they have the opportunity to place their faith in the Lord. He desires all people to come to repentance and experience salvation (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/2-Peter/3/2-Peter-3-9.html"&gt;2 Peter 3:9&lt;/a&gt;). It is important to note that God does not force anyone to go to hell. Instead, individuals choose to reject Christ and separate themselves from God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Recognizing that salvation is a choice helps us understand the personal nature of our relationship with God and the responsibility we have in responding to His grace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; Reflect on your own journey of faith. How did you come to the realization that you needed a Savior? Take a moment to express gratitude for God's grace in your life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;4. The Nature of God&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding why some people reject God while others choose to believe can be difficult. However, we can trust in the nature and character of God. He is sovereign and merciful, and His ways are perfect, even when we don't fully understand them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We must remember that God's desire is for all people to be saved (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-Timothy/2/1-Timothy-2-4.html"&gt;1 Timothy 2:4&lt;/a&gt;). He has provided ample evidence of His existence through creation and has revealed Himself through Jesus Christ. Ultimately, it is up to each individual to respond to this evidence and make a choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Trusting in God's nature and character allows us to find peace and reassurance even in the midst of unanswered questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; Consider areas of your life where you struggle to understand God's ways. How can you choose to trust Him despite not having all the answers?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;5. Salvation and Opportunity&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God's love is evident in the fact that He gives every person the opportunity to believe and be saved. He wants everyone to come to a knowledge of the truth (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-Timothy/2/1-Timothy-2-4.html"&gt;1 Timothy 2:4&lt;/a&gt;). If God did not give people the chance to place their faith in Him, He would not be a just and loving God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gJJWAIHKKDo" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Salvation is a gift from God that we receive through faith (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Ephesians/2/Ephesians-2-8.html"&gt;Ephesians 2:8-9&lt;/a&gt;). It is not something we can earn or achieve on our own merit. Rather, it is a result of God's grace and our response to His invitation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Recognizing salvation as a gift reminds us of the incredible love and mercy of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; How does understanding salvation as a gift impact your perspective on your relationship with God? How does it change the way you approach sharing the message of salvation with others?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;6. The Role of Faith&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Faith plays a crucial role in our relationship with God and our experience of salvation. Believing in Jesus Christ as the Son of God and accepting Him as our Lord and Savior is the key to receiving eternal life (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/3/John-3-16.html"&gt;John 3:16&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Faith involves trust and reliance on God. It is through faith that we are justified before God and experience the transformation of our lives. Faith is not simply an intellectual agreement with certain truths; it is a personal commitment to follow Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Understanding the role of faith helps us grasp the personal nature of our relationship with God and the transformative power it can have in our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; Reflect on your own faith journey. How has your faith in Jesus Christ impacted your life? In what ways has it brought you closer to God?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;7. The Unfathomable Love of God&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God's love for humanity is beyond comprehension. Despite our sin and rebellion, He offers us the opportunity to be reconciled with Him through faith in Jesus Christ. This act of sacrificial love demonstrates the depths of God's mercy and grace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Salvation is not something we deserve or earn. It is a gift that God freely offers to all who believe in His Son. This gift is a testament to the boundless love of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Recognizing the unfathomable love of God helps us respond with gratitude and worship, deepening our relationship with Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; Take a moment to reflect on the incredible love that God has shown you through the gift of salvation. How does this love inspire you to live for Him?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God does not create people who are doomed to hell. Rather, He gives every person the opportunity to believe and be saved. Salvation is a personal choice, and God's desire is for everyone to come to repentance and experience eternal life. Understanding the nature of God, the conviction of conscience, and the role of faith helps us grasp the depth of His love and our responsibility in responding to it. Let us continually seek a relationship with Him, sharing the message of salvation with others, and living a life that honors Him.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/God and Evil/The Existence of Sin and Evil"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Divine Pursuit: How God''s Unwavering Love Seeks Us</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/does-god-pursue-us/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-08-28T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-08-28T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-08-28:/does-god-pursue-us/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Does God Pursue Us&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pursuit of God is a central theme throughout the Bible. While human beings are commanded to pursue God and promised that they will find Him when they do, it is also clear that God is the initiator of these spiritual pursuits. Jesus said that no one can come to Him unless the Father first draws them (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/6/John-6-44.html"&gt;John 6:44&lt;/a&gt;). This concept can be understood through several parables that Jesus shared to illustrate God's pursuit of mankind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Initiation of God's Pursuit&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the very beginning, God has pursued us. After Adam and Eve sinned, they did not run towards God but instead hid among the trees of the garden. However, God did not give up on them. He called out to them, asking "Where are you?" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/3/Genesis-3-9.html"&gt;Genesis 3:9&lt;/a&gt;). This act of seeking them out exemplifies God's heart of reconciliation and His desire to have a relationship with His creation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Parables Illustrating God's Pursuit&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus used parables such as the lost sheep and the lost coin to teach about God's pursuit of us. In these parables, Jesus emphasized that God knows each person intimately and values them greatly. He highlighted the importance of every individual by comparing them to a lost sheep or a lost coin. Just as a shepherd would leave his flock to search for one lost sheep, God actively pursues each one of us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Ultimate Act of Pursuit&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God's pursuit of us culminated in the sending of His beloved Son, Jesus Christ, to die in our place (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/3/John-3-16.html"&gt;John 3:16&lt;/a&gt;–18; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/2-Corinthians/5/2-Corinthians-5-21.html"&gt;2 Corinthians 5:21&lt;/a&gt;; 9:15). We were unable to reach God through our own efforts, so He reached down to us. This act of sacrifice demonstrates the extent to which God is willing to pursue us and reconcile us to Himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;God's Pursuit Despite Our Obstinacy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IqKXH_MhJXg" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even when we are obstinate and resistant, God continues to pursue us. In the book of Isaiah, the Lord reveals that He revealed Himself to those who did not ask for Him and was found by those who did not seek Him. He held out His hands to an obstinate people who continually provoked Him (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/65/Isaiah-65-1.html"&gt;Isaiah 65:1&lt;/a&gt;–3). This demonstrates God's persistent pursuit of humanity, even when we turn away from Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Jesus' Pursuit of His Creation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus walked among the people He loved and lamented their spiritual stubbornness. He expressed His longing to gather the people of Jerusalem together, but they were unwilling (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/23/Matthew-23-37.html"&gt;Matthew 23:37&lt;/a&gt;). Jesus came in the flesh to pursue those He had created, but many rejected Him (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/1/John-1-11.html"&gt;John 1:11&lt;/a&gt;–13). However, God's message of redemption has gone out to the whole world, and salvation is available to all who believe (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/3/John-3-16.html"&gt;John 3:16&lt;/a&gt;; 12:46; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/1/Romans-1-16.html"&gt;Romans 1:16&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Continuation of God's Pursuit&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through His followers, Jesus has continued to pursue men and women from every era, nation, tribe, and tongue. The disciples were instructed to be witnesses to the ends of the earth (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Acts/1/Acts-1-8.html"&gt;Acts 1:8&lt;/a&gt;), and since then, believers have spread the good news that God is pursuing a relationship with them. The pursuit of God extends to believers today through the indwelling Holy Spirit. Through the Holy Spirit, God comforts, corrects, and compels His children to obey His Word. He disciplines us as part of His work in conforming us to the image of His Son (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/8/Romans-8-29.html"&gt;Romans 8:29&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/12/Hebrews-12-5.html"&gt;Hebrews 12:5&lt;/a&gt;–7).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding that God pursues us is essential because it reveals His love and desire for a relationship with us. It reminds us that our salvation is not based on our own efforts but on God's grace. Recognizing God's pursuit can also motivate us to respond to His love by seeking a deeper relationship with Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider the significance of God pursuing us even when we are obstinate or resistant. How does this revelation of God's character impact your view of Him? How can you respond to God's pursuit in your own life?&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/God's Relationship to Us/He Cares For Us"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Divine Patience: Understanding God''s Enduring Love for His People</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/god-is-patient/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-08-28T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-08-28T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-08-28:/god-is-patient/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;God's Patience: A Testament of Love and Mercy&lt;/h2&gt;

This article …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;God's Patience: A Testament of Love and Mercy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we think of God's character, we often focus on His love, justice, and wisdom. However, one attribute that is sometimes overlooked is His patience. The Bible provides numerous examples of God's patience, both in the Old and New Testaments. This article will explore the concept of God's patience, its significance, and its implications for us as believers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Nature of God's Patience&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Exodus/34/Exodus-34-6.html"&gt;Exodus 34:6&lt;/a&gt;, God describes Himself to Moses as "The Lord, the Lord, the compassionate and gracious God, slow to anger, abounding in love and faithfulness." This declaration highlights God's patience as an essential aspect of His character. Similarly, the psalmist praises God as "a compassionate and gracious God, slow to anger, abounding in love and faithfulness" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/86/Psalm-86-15.html"&gt;Psalm 86:15&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New Testament also affirms God's patience. The apostle Paul describes Him as kind, forbearing, and patient (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/2/Romans-2-4.html"&gt;Romans 2:4&lt;/a&gt;). Peter further emphasizes God's patience in relation to the second coming of Jesus: "The Lord is not slow in keeping His promise, as some understand slowness. Instead, He is patient with you, not wanting anyone to perish but everyone to come to repentance" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/2-Peter/3/2-Peter-3-9.html"&gt;2 Peter 3:9&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Scripture describes God as patient, it means that He endures humanity's flaws without easily getting angry. He holds back judgment to allow room for repentance. His patience is also evident in how He chooses to work through imperfect humans to accomplish His plans. Examples from the Bible include Noah, Abraham, Moses, King David, and the prophets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Examples of God's Patience&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God's patience is demonstrated throughout the Bible in various situations. Let us explore some notable instances:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;1. After the Fall&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Immediately after Adam and Eve sinned, God demonstrated His patience by providing clothing for them (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/3/Genesis-3-21.html"&gt;Genesis 3:21&lt;/a&gt;). Despite their disobedience, He showed compassion and sought to cover their shame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;2. The Time of Noah&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the days of Noah, the world was filled with corruption and violence (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/6/Genesis-6-11.html"&gt;Genesis 6:11&lt;/a&gt;). Yet, God did not swiftly execute judgment. Instead, He patiently waited while Noah built the ark, providing an opportunity for repentance (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-Peter/3/1-Peter-3-20.html"&gt;1 Peter 3:20&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;3. Sodom and Gomorrah&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When God planned to judge Sodom and Gomorrah for their wickedness, Abraham interceded on behalf of the cities. God agreed not to destroy them if He found even ten righteous people there (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/18/Genesis-18-32.html"&gt;Genesis 18:32&lt;/a&gt;). This display of patience reveals God's desire to show mercy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;4. Dealing with the Canaanites&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/15/Genesis-15-16.html"&gt;Genesis 15:16&lt;/a&gt;, God told Abraham that his descendants would possess the land of Canaan, but not immediately. He explained that "the sin of the Amorites has not yet reached its full measure." God's patience allowed time for repentance before executing judgment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;5. The Ninevites&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the story of Jonah, we see God's patience with the people of Nineveh. Despite their wickedness, when they repented after Jonah's warning, God relented from bringing destruction upon them (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Jonah/3/Jonah-3-10.html"&gt;Jonah 3:10&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;6. The Israelites&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout the Old Testament, we witness God's long-suffering with the Israelites. Despite their continuous rebellion and idolatry, He patiently dealt with them and extended opportunities for repentance (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/2-Kings/17/2-Kings-17-13.html"&gt;2 Kings 17:13-14&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;7. Jesus' Sacrifice&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ultimate display of God's patience is seen in Jesus Christ. As the Son of God, Jesus came to earth, lived among His creation, and endured challenges during His ministry. He patiently endured humiliation and death on the cross to accomplish the redemption of humanity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding and appreciating God's patience is essential for our faith and relationship with Him. It reveals His immense love, mercy, and desire for all people to come to repentance. God's patience gives us hope, knowing that He is willing to wait for us to turn to Him and receive His salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God's patience should also shape our attitudes and actions towards others. As followers of Christ, we are called to imitate His character. We are called to be patient with others, just as God has been patient with us (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Colossians/3/Colossians-3-12.html"&gt;Colossians 3:12&lt;/a&gt;). Our patience can be a powerful testimony of God's love and can lead others to repentance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think About It&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reflect on a time when you experienced God's patience in your own life. How did it impact your relationship with Him?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consider someone in your life who may be testing your patience. How can you reflect God's patience towards them?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does the concept of God's patience challenge your understanding of justice and judgment? How can you reconcile these seemingly contrasting attributes of God?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, God's patience is a remarkable testament to His love and mercy. It is an integral part of His character, demonstrated throughout the Bible. Understanding and embracing God's patience deepens our appreciation for His grace and encourages us to extend the same patience to others. Let us strive to imitate His patience as we seek to live out our faith in a broken world.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/The Character of God/God’s Love"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Experiencing the Transformative Grace of God: A Christian''s Guide to Embracing Divine Favor</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/grace-of-god/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-08-28T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-08-28T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-08-28:/grace-of-god/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Grace of God&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grace is a central theme in the Bible, particularly in the New Testament with the arrival of Jesus (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/1/John-1-17.html"&gt;John 1:17&lt;/a&gt;).

&lt;p&gt;Grace is a central theme in the Bible, particularly in the New Testament with the arrival of Jesus (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/1/John-1-17.html"&gt;John 1:17&lt;/a&gt;). The Greek word for "grace" is "charis," which means "favor, blessing, or kindness." When we talk about grace in relation to God, it carries a profound meaning. It refers to God's choice to bless us instead of condemning us as our sin deserves. Grace is His benevolence towards those who don't deserve it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Grace in the Old Testament&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grace can be traced back to the Garden of Eden when God covered Adam and Eve's sin by sacrificing an animal (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/3/Genesis-3-21.html"&gt;Genesis 3:21&lt;/a&gt;). Instead of destroying them for their disobedience, He made a way for them to be reconciled with Him. Throughout the Old Testament, God instituted blood sacrifices as a means to atone for sin (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/10/Hebrews-10-4.html"&gt;Hebrews 10:4&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/15/Genesis-15-6.html"&gt;Genesis 15:6&lt;/a&gt;). These sacrifices did not cleanse sinners through physical blood alone but through the grace of God that forgave those who trusted in Him. By offering these sacrifices, sinful humans demonstrated their faith in God's requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Origin of Grace&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The apostle Paul often began his letters with the greeting, "Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/1/Romans-1-7.html"&gt;Romans 1:7&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Ephesians/1/Ephesians-1-1.html"&gt;Ephesians 1:1&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-Corinthians/1/1-Corinthians-1-3.html"&gt;1 Corinthians 1:3&lt;/a&gt;). It is God who initiates grace, and all other forms of grace flow from Him. He shows both mercy and grace, but they are not the same thing. Mercy involves withholding punishment that we deserve, while grace involves giving blessings that we don't deserve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YGBDAxCDLs4" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;God's Mercy and Grace&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In His mercy, God chose to cancel our sin debt by sacrificing His perfect Son on our behalf (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Titus/3/Titus-3-5.html"&gt;Titus 3:5&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/2-Corinthians/5/2-Corinthians-5-21.html"&gt;2 Corinthians 5:21&lt;/a&gt;). However, God's grace goes beyond mercy and extends to His enemies (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/5/Romans-5-10.html"&gt;Romans 5:10&lt;/a&gt;). Through His grace, He offers us forgiveness (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/8/Hebrews-8-12.html"&gt;Hebrews 8:12&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Ephesians/1/Ephesians-1-7.html"&gt;Ephesians 1:7&lt;/a&gt;), reconciliation (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Colossians/1/Colossians-1-19.html"&gt;Colossians 1:19-20&lt;/a&gt;), abundant life (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/10/John-10-10.html"&gt;John 10:10&lt;/a&gt;), eternal treasure (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/12/Luke-12-33.html"&gt;Luke 12:33&lt;/a&gt;), the Holy Spirit (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/11/Luke-11-13.html"&gt;Luke 11:13&lt;/a&gt;), and the promise of a place in heaven with Him (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/3/John-3-16.html"&gt;John 3:16-18&lt;/a&gt;) when we accept His offer and place our faith in the sacrifice of Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the concept of God's grace is crucial for every Christian. It reminds us that our salvation is not based on our own efforts, but on the unmerited favor of God. We cannot earn or deserve God's grace; it is freely given to us through faith in Jesus Christ. Recognizing this truth humbles us, eliminates pride, and helps us rely on God rather than our own abilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider the incredible gift of grace that God has bestowed upon you. Reflect on the fact that He chose to bless you instead of condemning you. How does this understanding impact your relationship with God and your interactions with others? In what ways can you extend grace to those around you, following God's example? Take a moment to thank God for His abundant grace in your life and ask for His help in showing grace to others.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/The Character of God/God’s Love"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Divine Repentance: Understanding God''s Change of Heart</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/god-repented/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-08-27T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-08-27T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-08-27:/god-repented/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;God's Repentance: Understanding the Biblical Perspective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Bible, there are instances where it is mentioned that God "repented." This can be confusing because repentance is often associated with human beings acknowledging their sins and changing their ways. However, when we talk about God's repentance, it is important to …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;God's Repentance: Understanding the Biblical Perspective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Bible, there are instances where it is mentioned that God "repented." This can be confusing because repentance is often associated with human beings acknowledging their sins and changing their ways. However, when we talk about God's repentance, it is important to understand that it is described in human terms, known as anthropomorphism. It does not imply that God changes His mind or gains new information, as He is omniscient and knows all things from the beginning. Instead, it refers to how God interacts with us in real time and responds to our actions and decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1. The Meaning of Repentance&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Repentance, at its core, means "to change one's mind." When we repent of our sins, we change our perspective on sin, recognizing it as evil and harmful instead of accepting it as good or enjoyable. This change of mind leads to a change in our actions and behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2. God's Timeless Knowledge&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God possesses timeless knowledge and does not gain new information that would cause Him to change His mind. &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Numbers/23/Numbers-23-19.html"&gt;Numbers 23:19&lt;/a&gt; states that God does not lie or repent because He never gains access to new information. His omniscience allows Him to know what will happen before it occurs. Therefore, when we speak of God's repentance, it is not a literal change of mind but rather an interaction in real time with humanity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;3. Interaction with Humans&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fzblLkdqzpg" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;God interacts with humanity in the present moment. He does not treat us based on future sins or future repentance. If we are walking in obedience and fellowship with Him today, He does not act on the sins we may commit in the future. Similarly, if we are living in sinfulness now but are going to repent later, God does not treat us as if we have already repented. He deals with us in the present, according to our current situation and actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;4. God's Repentance in the Bible&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the King James Version of the Bible, there are verses such as &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Jeremiah/26/Jeremiah-26-13.html"&gt;Jeremiah 26:13&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-Chronicles/21/1-Chronicles-21-15.html"&gt;1 Chronicles 21:15&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Joel/2/Joel-2-13.html"&gt;Joel 2:13&lt;/a&gt; that mention God's repentance. However, it is important to note that the term "repented" can be misleading. The NIV translation, for example, uses the term "relent," which conveys the idea more accurately. These verses describe instances where God was going to bring judgment upon people, but in response to their change of mind about sin (repentance), God also "changed His mind" about the judgment. He relented and did not bring the disaster He had pronounced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;5. The Eternal Level&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the eternal level, God does not change His mind or repent because He sees all things from the beginning to the end. His plans are unchanging and perfect. However, when interacting with humanity, His actions and responses may vary based on our choices and decisions. This allows for a dynamic relationship between God and humanity, where our actions can influence His response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding God's repentance in human terms helps us grasp His relational nature. It demonstrates that God responds to our decisions and actions in real time. This encourages us to take responsibility for our choices and seek repentance when we have strayed from His ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider how God's interaction with us in real time impacts your understanding of repentance. Does it change how you view your own relationship with God? How might this understanding affect your perspective on sin and its consequences?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, when we encounter passages in the Bible that mention God's repentance, it is crucial to interpret them within the framework of anthropomorphism. God's "repentance" does not imply a literal change of mind or a lack of omniscience. Instead, it highlights His dynamic interaction with humanity, responding to our choices and actions. Understanding God's repentance in this way deepens our appreciation for His relational nature and encourages us to seek repentance and obedience in our own lives.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/The Character of God/Anthropomorphism"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Sovereignty of God: Unveiling the Divine Power in Christian Faith</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/sovereignty-of-god/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-08-27T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-08-27T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-08-27:/sovereignty-of-god/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;The Sovereignty of God: Understanding God's Control and Its Practical Impact&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sovereignty of God is a fundamental belief in Christianity that emphasizes God's complete control over the universe. While this concept may seem abstract or irrelevant to our daily lives, it has practical implications that can greatly impact our faith and how we navigate life's challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What is the Sovereignty of God?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sovereignty of God means that God is in control of everything that happens in the world. It is important to note that this belief does not negate human free will or make us passive recipients of fate. Instead, it asserts that while humans have the ability to make choices with real consequences, God ultimately allows all things to happen and His will ultimately prevails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Trusting God's Character and Care&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/u6OVV3jO8R4" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One practical impact of recognizing the sovereignty of God is that it removes the cause for worry from our lives. We can trust that God's character, as revealed in the Bible, aligns with His ability to care for us. &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/8/Romans-8-28.html"&gt;Romans 8:28&lt;/a&gt; reassures us, "And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him, who have been called according to his purpose." This verse assures us that even when we cannot see how things will work out for our good, we can rest in the knowledge that God is able to work all things together for our benefit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Trusting God's Sanctifying Work&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another practical aspect of the sovereignty of God is trusting His sanctifying work in our lives. While Christians are called to obedience and personal growth, we can also trust that God is actively involved in shaping us into Christlikeness. &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Galatians/3/Galatians-3-3.html"&gt;Galatians 3:3&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Philippians/1/Philippians-1-6.html"&gt;Philippians 1:6&lt;/a&gt; highlight this truth. Recognizing that our maturity in faith is not solely dependent on our efforts but on God's sovereign plan brings a sense of peace and freedom. We can focus on getting to know God and rely on His transforming power rather than solely relying on our own performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Making Decisions with Confidence&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding God's sovereignty also affects how we make decisions. We can approach decision-making without fear or paralysis, knowing that even if we make mistakes, God is faithful and can guide us back on the right path. The sovereignty of God does not imply passivity; rather, it allows us to go boldly into life, trusting that our loving Father sees the bigger picture and is faithfully working all things for His glory. We can take action, make choices, and trust that God's sovereign control encompasses our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Finding Security in God's Love&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recognizing God's sovereignty has a significant impact on our sense of identity and security. When we understand the extent of God's power and love for us, we can find our worth and security in Him alone. Instead of seeking validation from the ever-changing ideals of the world, we can allow God to define us. &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/8/Romans-8-1.html"&gt;Romans 8:1&lt;/a&gt; reminds us that there is no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus. We can have confidence that God's sovereign plan will ultimately bring about good and trust that His love for us is unwavering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the sovereignty of God is crucial for our faith journey. It provides a solid foundation for trusting in God's character, care, and transformative work in our lives. When we grasp the concept of God's sovereignty, we can find freedom from worry, security in His love, and confidence in decision-making. As Christians, recognizing God's sovereignty helps us navigate life's challenges with faith and hope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does the belief in the sovereignty of God impact your daily life?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What practical steps can you take to trust God more fully in your decision-making process?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does understanding God's sovereignty bring you peace and security in an ever-changing world?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, the sovereignty of God is a foundational belief in Christianity that emphasizes God's complete control over the universe. While it may seem abstract, it has practical implications for our daily lives. Recognizing God's sovereignty allows us to trust in His character, His sanctifying work, and His guidance in decision-making. It also provides security in our identity and a sense of peace in an unpredictable world. Embracing the sovereignty of God deepens our faith and empowers us to live with confidence and purpose.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/God's Relationship to Us/Toward All People"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Unveiling the Divine Glory: 7 Powerful Insights for Christian Believers</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/glory-of-god/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-08-26T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-08-26T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-08-26:/glory-of-god/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;The Glory of God&lt;/h2&gt;

Unlike the glory of man, which fades away, the glory of God …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;The Glory of God&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The glory of God is a concept that refers to the beauty and majesty of His character. It is not a physical or material beauty but rather a reflection of all that He is. Unlike the glory of man, which fades away, the glory of God is eternal and unchanging. In the Old Testament, the glory of God was often accompanied by supernatural phenomena such as fire, clouds, and earthquakes. Moses once asked God to show him His glory, and in response, God revealed His goodness. However, because no mortal can fully comprehend or withstand the fullness of God's glory, Moses was hidden in a cleft in the rock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the New Testament, the glory of God is manifested in Jesus Christ. He is described as the "one and only Son" who came from the Father, full of grace and truth. Through Jesus, the glory of God became approachable and knowable. Jesus performed miracles that revealed His glory and promised to return someday with power and great glory. The redemption of Israel and the natural world also demonstrate God's glory. The psalmist declares that the heavens declare the glory of God, and all creation proclaims His work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heaven itself is referred to as "glory," and when believers die, they are received into glory in God's presence. In the future New Jerusalem, the city will be illuminated by the glory of God without the need for sun or moon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7zL9BfEcUdc" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is important to note that God will not share His glory with anyone or anything else. Scripture condemns idolatry as people exchange the glory of God for images made to look like created beings. Only God is eternal, perfect, and worthy of worship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the glory of God helps us grasp His nature and character. It reminds us that He is far greater than we can comprehend and deserves our worship and reverence. Recognizing God's glory also helps us put our own achievements and pride in perspective. The glory of man is temporary and fades away, but the glory of God is eternal and unchanging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take a moment to reflect on the beauty and majesty of God's character. How does recognizing His glory impact your worship and reverence for Him? Consider the transient nature of human glory compared to the eternal glory of God. How does this perspective shape your priorities and values?&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/The Character of God/God’s Holiness"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Divine Assistance: How God Empowers Believers to Help Themselves</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/god-help-themselves/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-08-25T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-08-25T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-08-25:/god-help-themselves/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;God Helps the Helpless&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The phrase "God helps those who help themselves" is often quoted, but it is not actually found in the Bible. It is commonly attributed to Benjamin Franklin, who mentioned it in 1757. However, the saying can be traced back even further to Algernon Sydney in 1698 …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;God Helps the Helpless&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The phrase "God helps those who help themselves" is often quoted, but it is not actually found in the Bible. It is commonly attributed to Benjamin Franklin, who mentioned it in 1757. However, the saying can be traced back even further to Algernon Sydney in 1698. While this phrase has gained popularity, it is important to note that it does not align with the teachings of the Bible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contrary to the popular saying, the Bible teaches that God helps the helpless. &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/25/Isaiah-25-4.html"&gt;Isaiah 25:4&lt;/a&gt; describes God as a defense for the helpless and a refuge from distress. &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/5/Romans-5-6.html"&gt;Romans 5:6&lt;/a&gt; states that Christ died for the ungodly while they were still helpless. These verses highlight how God extends His help to those who are unable to help themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of salvation, we are all completely helpless. The Bible tells us that all have sinned and fallen short of God's glory (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/3/Romans-3-23.html"&gt;Romans 3:23&lt;/a&gt;), and as a result, we face condemnation (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/6/Romans-6-23.html"&gt;Romans 6:23&lt;/a&gt;). There is nothing we can do on our own to remedy this situation (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/64/Isaiah-64-6.html"&gt;Isaiah 64:6&lt;/a&gt;). However, there is good news. God, in His mercy and love, offers His help to us. While we were still sinners, Jesus died for us (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/5/Romans-5-8.html"&gt;Romans 5:8&lt;/a&gt;). Jesus paid the penalty for our sins that we were incapable of paying (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/2-Corinthians/5/2-Corinthians-5-21.html"&gt;2 Corinthians 5:21&lt;/a&gt;). It is through God's provision and grace that we are saved because we cannot save ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Importance of Taking Action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qK9zrW-vh-k" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the concept of "God helps those who help themselves" may not align with salvation, there is a sense in which it holds some truth. Let's consider an example - if you asked someone to help you move a piece of furniture but simply watched as they did all the work, would you truly be helping? In this scenario, you would not be actively participating in the task at hand. Many Christians fall into the trap of inactivity when it comes to seeking God's help. They ask for His assistance but expect Him to do everything on their behalf. While it is true that God provides according to His will and timing, it does not mean we should be inactive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, if you are in need of a job, it is appropriate to ask the Lord for help but also take action by actively searching for employment. God expects us to be diligent in our efforts and seek His guidance as we make decisions. It is highly unlikely that God will cause employers to come looking for us without any effort on our part.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the truth about how God helps the helpless is crucial for our faith and relationship with Him. Recognizing that we are powerless to save ourselves and relying on God's grace fosters humility and gratitude in our hearts. It reminds us that our salvation is not earned through our own efforts but is a gift freely given by God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, realizing the importance of taking action and being diligent in seeking God's help encourages us to actively participate in our own lives. We are called to be obedient and faithful stewards of the opportunities and resources God has provided. Instead of passively waiting for things to happen, we should actively engage with the world around us, trusting that God will guide and empower us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reflect on your own life. Have you ever fallen into the trap of inactivity, expecting God to do everything without taking any action yourself? How can you strike a balance between relying on God's help and being proactive in your endeavors?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider how understanding the truth about God helping the helpless impacts your perspective on salvation. How does recognizing your own helplessness and dependence on God's grace shape your relationship with Him?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What are some practical steps you can take to actively seek God's help in specific areas of your life? How can you demonstrate diligence and faithfulness while relying on His guidance and provision?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Christians, let us embrace the truth that God helps the helpless. May we humbly depend on His grace for our salvation and actively participate in the work He has called us to do.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/God's Relationship to Us/Toward All People"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Divine Presence: Unlocking the Power of Omnipresence in Your Christian Walk</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/presence-omnipresence/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-08-25T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-08-25T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-08-25:/presence-omnipresence/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Presence and Omnipresence&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bible teaches that God is omnipresent, which means that He is present everywhere at all times. In Psalm 139, David acknowledges this truth by asking, "Where can I go from your Spirit? Where can I flee from your presence?" He then goes on to describe how …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Presence and Omnipresence&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bible teaches that God is omnipresent, which means that He is present everywhere at all times. In Psalm 139, David acknowledges this truth by asking, "Where can I go from your Spirit? Where can I flee from your presence?" He then goes on to describe how even if he were to ascend to the heavens or descend to the depths of the sea, God would be there. This demonstrates that no matter where we go, God is always with us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Acts 17, the apostle Paul also affirms God's omnipresence when he says, "He is not far from any one of us. 'For in him we live and move and have our being.'" This highlights the fact that God's presence encompasses everything and everyone. Even though we may not always be aware of His presence, He is constantly near us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, there is another sense in which we can either be in or out of God's "presence." In this context, the presence of God refers to His divine blessing and embracing love. The children of God are promised to experience everlasting joy in His presence. As &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/16/Psalm-16-11.html"&gt;Psalm 16:11&lt;/a&gt; states, "You will fill me with joy in your presence, with eternal pleasures at your right hand." This indicates that being in God's presence brings about a sense of joy and fulfillment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, those who reject the gospel will be punished with everlasting destruction and shut out from the presence of the Lord. This separation from God's presence is a consequence of their rejection of Him. It is important to note that this punishment is not merely physical but also spiritual, as it involves being eternally separated from the glory and might of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The presence of God can also refer to a place of honor. Just as it is a privilege to stand in the presence of a king, standing in the presence of God carries great honor and significance. In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/1/Luke-1-19.html"&gt;Luke 1:19&lt;/a&gt;, the angel Gabriel describes himself as one who stands in the presence of God. This indicates that being in the presence of God is a position of honor and authority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the presence of God can also be associated with the demonstration of overwhelming glory and heavenly majesty. When Isaiah had his vision of God on His throne, he described the seraphim as being unable to view God's glory directly. This demonstrates that the presence of God is awe-inspiring and humbling for sinful humanity to approach. It emphasizes the holiness and majesty of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The presence of God can also refer to a unique revelation of Himself to humanity. Throughout history, God has chosen specific locations or events to reveal His presence to His people. For example, Moses encountered God's presence at the burning bush, and later, God revealed Himself at Mount Sinai. These instances highlight how God chooses to manifest His presence in specific ways for the purpose of communicating with His people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to distinguish between God's omnipresence, which is His all-pervading presence, and His manifest presence, which refers to His overt and unmistakable interaction with us. While God is always present everywhere, there are times when He chooses to manifest His presence in a more tangible way so that we can recognize and experience Him more deeply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the concept of God's omnipresence and manifest presence is significant for our relationship with Him. Recognizing that God is always with us brings comfort, assurance, and a sense of security. We can find solace in knowing that we are never alone, even in our most challenging moments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cnVFbQOwdZE" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Knowing that God's presence carries blessings and joy encourages us to seek after Him and cultivate a deeper connection with Him. It reminds us that true fulfillment and happiness are found in His presence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, understanding the honor and awe associated with being in the presence of God helps us approach Him with reverence and respect. It reminds us of His holiness and the need for repentance and humility in His presence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take a moment to reflect on the concept of God's omnipresence. How does knowing that God is always with you impact your daily life?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider the privilege of being in the presence of God. How does this perspective change the way you approach Him in prayer, worship, and obedience?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reflect on the manifestations of God's presence throughout history. How have these instances deepened your understanding of God's character and His desire to communicate with His people?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

It is important to note that demanding certain forms of proof or levels of certainty may be irrelevant or unreasonable when …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Evidence for the Existence of God&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many people wonder if there is evidence for the existence of God. While not everyone finds this evidence compelling, it does exist. It is important to note that demanding certain forms of proof or levels of certainty may be irrelevant or unreasonable when it comes to discussing the existence of God. In this article, we will explore various categories of evidence for the existence of God, including logic, experience, history, and science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Logic and Philosophy: Categorizing Evidence&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some individuals question the idea of "evidence" for a God who is invisible and immaterial. However, it is essential to recognize that there are many intangible and non-material concepts that we accept as real, such as the laws of logic. Logic is not something we can see or quantify mechanically, yet it exists and can be perceived and examined. Similarly, other concepts like morality also exist in a meaningful way, even though they are intangible. Therefore, it is reasonable to consider logic and philosophy when discussing evidence for the existence of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Historical and Anthropological Perspectives&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Historians and anthropologists acknowledge that belief in some form of supernatural reality has been common among human beings throughout history. Even in cultures that are considered "secular," the rejection of any higher power or spiritual realm is a minority view. Cognitive science of religion suggests that such beliefs are ingrained in the natural state of the human mind. This suggests that there is something real to be perceived, just as our senses perceive actual phenomena like sight and hearing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recognizing the historical and anthropological prevalence of belief in a higher power helps us understand that there is something innate within us that seeks to connect with a divine being. It challenges us to consider whether this universal human belief points towards the existence of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Think About It&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why do you think belief in a higher power is so widespread among human beings? How does this impact your own understanding of the existence of God?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Logic-Based Arguments&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several logical arguments that indicate the existence of God. While some arguments may not be considered especially convincing, they are difficult to refute. Others, such as the Kalam cosmological argument, are more robust and widely accepted. Teleological arguments, such as intelligent design, make logical inferences from observations to argue for the existence of God. These arguments arise from the observation that many aspects of reality appear to be deliberately arranged, suggesting the presence of a Creator. For example, the Big Bang theory, initially resisted by atheists as being too "religious," actually supports claims made in the early chapters of the Bible regarding a non-eternal universe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Bible as Evidence&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bible itself can be considered a form of evidence for the existence of God. It is important not to dismiss it as biased simply because it contains claims that skeptics may not accept. The reliability of the Bible and its coordination with secular history and archaeology are reasonable points to consider when discussing the existence of God. Just as we accept other historical texts as evidence for past events and figures, we should also consider the Bible in its historical and cultural context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_ie9musGEqQ" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recognizing the reliability of the Bible helps us understand that it is not merely a religious text but also an important historical document that provides evidence for the existence of God. Engaging with its content can lead us to a deeper understanding of our faith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Think About It&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How does understanding the historical reliability of the Bible impact your perception of its credibility as evidence for the existence of God? How might this influence your study and interpretation of Scripture?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Personal Experiences&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many individuals have had personal experiences that have led them to know and understand God in a deeply personal way. While these experiences may not be directly observable or measurable by others, they should still be considered as part of the evidence for the existence of God. When personal experiences align with other forms of evidence, they become even more compelling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Ignoring or Dismissing Evidence&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One common response to evidence for the existence of God is to ignore it or claim that there is no evidence. However, this response may be intellectually unsatisfying as it disregards the various forms of evidence that have been presented. It is also important to note that one person's disbelief does not serve as hard evidence against the existence of God. Additionally, personal biases and desires for personal autonomy can influence our response to evidence, leading us to stubbornly ignore it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ignoring or dismissing evidence without engaging with it hinders our ability to explore and understand the truth about the existence of God. Being open to considering different forms of evidence allows us to develop a more comprehensive understanding of our faith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Think About It&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why do you think some people choose to ignore or dismiss evidence for the existence of God? How might our own biases and desires impact our willingness to engage with this evidence?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we consider logic, experience, history, science, and personal testimonies, there is substantial evidence for the existence of God. It is important to recognize that we may not find all the evidence in one place, but rather by engaging with different sources and perspectives. Ultimately, our relationship with God is not solely dependent on having all the evidence but on seeking Him with an open heart and mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, let us continue to explore, ask questions, seek understanding, and knock on the doors of knowledge as we journey in our faith.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/The Identity of God/The Existence of God"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Essential Faith: Understanding God''s Requirement for Believers</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/god-require-faith/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-08-24T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-08-24T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-08-24:/god-require-faith/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;God Requires Faith&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our relationship with God, just like our relationships with others, requires faith. Faith is an integral component of all relationships because we can never fully know another person. We cannot experience everything they experience or fully understand their thoughts and emotions. In the book of Proverbs, it …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;God Requires Faith&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our relationship with God, just like our relationships with others, requires faith. Faith is an integral component of all relationships because we can never fully know another person. We cannot experience everything they experience or fully understand their thoughts and emotions. In the book of Proverbs, it says, "The heart knows its own bitterness, and a stranger does not share its joy" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Proverbs/14/Proverbs-14-10.html"&gt;Proverbs 14:10&lt;/a&gt;). Even our own hearts can be deceptive and wicked, making it difficult for us to fully know ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we cannot fully know other finite human beings, how can we expect to fully know an infinite God? Even if God desired to fully reveal Himself to us, it would be impossible for us to comprehend Him completely. It would be like trying to pour the vastness of the ocean into a small measuring jar. However, God has revealed enough about Himself through His creation, the Bible, and His Son, Jesus Christ, that we can enter into a meaningful relationship with Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To have a relationship with God, we need to trust in Jesus Christ as the payment for our sins. Sin creates a barrier between a holy God and sinful humanity. Jesus, the sinless Son of God, died on the cross to take our punishment and bridge the gap between us and God. By believing in Him, we can become children of God and live eternally in His presence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout history, there have been instances where God revealed Himself more visibly to people. For example, during the exodus from Egypt, God demonstrated His love and power by sending miraculous plagues upon the Egyptians and parting the Red Sea for the Israelites. He also provided them with food and guided them through a pillar of cloud and fire. However, even with these tangible demonstrations of His presence and care, the Israelites still struggled to trust Him when faced with challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eBJp_DWFqJw" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This reveals that further revelation from God would not necessarily increase our ability to trust Him. Our sinful hearts are prone to rebellion and self-rule, as seen in the Israelites' response. The problem lies not in God insufficiently revealing Himself, but in our sinful nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God has revealed enough of His nature for us to trust Him. Through history, nature, and Jesus Christ, He has shown that He is all-powerful, all-knowing, all-wise, all-loving, all-holy, unchanging, and eternal. In this revelation, He has proven Himself worthy of our trust. However, the choice to trust Him ultimately rests with us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To deepen our understanding of God, we should study the Bible carefully. The Bible is God's inerrant Word and provides insights into His character and plan for humanity. By relying on Jesus Christ as our Savior and studying His Word, we can come to know God more intimately and have a close relationship with Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the role of faith in our relationship with God is crucial for every Christian. It helps us recognize that faith is not blind or arbitrary but based on the evidence of God's revelation throughout history and in Scripture. Recognizing this can strengthen our trust and reliance on God, even when faced with challenging circumstances or unanswered questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reflect on your own relationship with God. How has faith played a role in it?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consider the different ways God has revealed Himself to you personally. How have these revelations deepened your faith?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are there areas in your life where you struggle to trust God? How can a deeper understanding of His character and past faithfulness help you overcome those struggles?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take time to study the Bible and discover more about who God is and what He has done. How can this knowledge deepen your faith and relationship with Him?&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some who argue that the God presented in the Bible is cruel. They point to certain passages that they claim demonstrate God's cruelty. However, it is important to approach this question with an understanding of God's character and His ways. While we may not always …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Is God Cruel?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some who argue that the God presented in the Bible is cruel. They point to certain passages that they claim demonstrate God's cruelty. However, it is important to approach this question with an understanding of God's character and His ways. While we may not always comprehend His actions, we can trust in His goodness and love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;God's Actions and Human Understanding&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those who claim that God is cruel have a significant burden of proof. They are not only claiming to know about the actions of God, but also the circumstances in which He performed those actions and His motivations. Furthermore, they are asserting that they know the mind of God, attributing to Him attitudes of indifference and sadistic pleasure necessary to define Him as cruel. This is beyond human capability—we cannot truly know the mind of God. As the prophet Isaiah wrote, "For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/55/Isaiah-55-8.html"&gt;Isaiah 55:8-9&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it is true that God allows and sometimes causes pain and suffering, we cannot impugn His goodness based on our limited understanding. Rather than assuming cruelty, we should seek to understand the reasons behind His actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Just Punishment or Cruelty?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to consider whether a punishment can be considered cruel if it is just. When God brings punishment upon people, His love is not diminished. In fact, He may be punishing an evil group of people in order to spare those who are devoted to Him. Allowing evil and wrongdoing to go unpunished would be cruel and demonstrate a callousness towards the innocent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, when God caused the Red Sea to close, drowning Pharaoh's army, He was punishing Pharaoh's rebellion against Him while preserving His chosen people from certain slaughter (Exodus 14). Similarly, when God commanded the Israelites to completely destroy their enemies, including women and children, He knew that letting them live would perpetuate future generations devoted to evil practices, including child sacrifices (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Deuteronomy/20/Deuteronomy-20-16.html"&gt;Deuteronomy 20:16-18&lt;/a&gt;). In these instances, God's actions may appear cruel to us, but they are rooted in justice and the preservation of what is good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Pain and Suffering for a Greater Good&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes pain and suffering are necessary to bring about a greater good. Trials and difficulties can produce stronger, better Christians. The Apostle Paul saw his own suffering as a means to keep him reliant on God's power rather than his own (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/2-Corinthians/1/2-Corinthians-1-8.html"&gt;2 Corinthians 1:8-10&lt;/a&gt;; 4:7-12).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God's justice is also vindicated when pain and suffering befall those who deserve it. God demonstrates His mercy by warning individuals repeatedly of the consequences of sin. When people bring calamity upon themselves through their rebellion, it is just punishment, not cruelty. God's patience in allowing rebels to continue shaking their fists at Him indicates His mercy and not cruelty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;God's Glory in All His Attributes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gDCCzzwy_Nk" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;God is glorified when all His attributes are exhibited, including His wrath and anger. While we often appreciate the display of His love and mercy, even the exhibition of His wrath brings Him glory. Ultimately, our goal should be to bring glory to God rather than ourselves. Our finite understanding cannot fully grasp the magnitude of His attributes or question them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Understanding the Book of Job&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book of Job is often cited as evidence of God's sadistic actions against an innocent man. However, a superficial understanding of the book fails to grasp its true message. In the cultural context of the time, people believed that God always blessed the righteous and brought suffering on the unrighteous. The book of Job challenges this theology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Job's suffering highlights that God is not limited to using suffering as a means of retribution. He also uses it to draw people away from earthly temptations. Additionally, Job brings us closer to understanding God's work of atonement on the cross. If we continued to believe that God couldn't allow an innocent man to suffer, we would miss out on God's plan for redemption. The suffering of Jesus Christ demonstrates God's willingness to endure suffering for the sake of bringing salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the nature of God and His actions is crucial for our faith. It enables us to trust in Him even when we don't fully comprehend His ways. Recognizing that God's actions are motivated by His holy and perfect character helps us navigate the challenges of life and draw closer to Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does our limited understanding affect our perception of God's actions?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can punishment be considered just even if it appears cruel to us?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does pain and suffering contribute to our growth and development as Christians?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In what ways can we bring glory to God even in times of suffering?&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hell is often portrayed in a simplistic and trivial manner in modern Western culture. This misconception, along with distorted notions of love and a limited understanding of God, makes it challenging to comprehend how God can love people in hell. To understand this concept, we need to dispel these misconceptions and explore the nature of God's love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Who is God?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God is not a finite, human-like being with superpowers. He transcends the cosmos and is being itself (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Exodus/3/Exodus-3-14.html"&gt;Exodus 3:14&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Acts/17/Acts-17-24.html"&gt;Acts 17:24&lt;/a&gt;–29). It is crucial to grasp this because when the Bible says that "God is love" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-John/4/1-John-4-8.html"&gt;1 John 4:8&lt;/a&gt;), it means that love is an essential part of His nature. God's love is not influenced by our actions or our location; He loves people in hell because that is who He is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Understanding Love&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Love, in the Christian sense, involves willing what is good for another person. It is not merely a feeling or emotion but a self-sacrificial act that seeks the well-being of others. The ultimate example of this love was demonstrated on the cross when Jesus gave His life to offer us eternal life (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/3/John-3-16.html"&gt;John 3:16&lt;/a&gt;). This divine love extends to all creatures, as God's essence knows and desires their good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Reality of Hell&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contrary to popular culture's trivialization of hell, the Bible depicts it as a place of conscious torment for the wicked until the future resurrection (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/16/Luke-16-19.html"&gt;Luke 16:19&lt;/a&gt;–31). After the final judgment, the unrighteous will be cast into the lake of fire (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Revelation/20/Revelation-20-11.html"&gt;Revelation 20:11&lt;/a&gt;–15), while the righteous will dwell with God eternally. In hell, the experience of God's presence is different from that in heaven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How Does God Love People in Hell?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From an absolute standpoint, it is good for creatures and their Creator to be united, as it was in the beginning (Genesis 1—2). Sin disrupts this union, causing a separation between God and His creation. Sin can be seen as the inward turning away from what is good for creatures. Without the redemptive love of Christ, individuals persist in their ruinous state of self-centeredness and rejection of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vGxFxv3DM48" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;God's love for His creation manifests differently to the impenitent creature than to the penitent. It is the same love experienced from two perspectives. Imagine two people outside on a sunny day—one in the sunshine and another in the shadow. Both experience the same sun, but their perception differs based on their situation relative to the sun. Similarly, the experience of God's love is different in hell than in heaven. Instead of experiencing the fullness of God's grace, those in hell experience the fullness of divine wrath.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding that God loves people in hell challenges popular misconceptions about hell and God's nature. It highlights the importance of recognizing God's transcendence and His unconditional love for all His creatures. This knowledge can deepen our appreciation for God's love and inspire us to seek reconciliation with Him through Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does your understanding of hell align with the biblical depiction?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In what ways can recognizing God's love for people in hell impact your own perspective on forgiveness and redemption?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reflect on how your perception of God's love might change when you consider His transcendence and His unwavering nature as love itself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does comprehending God's love for people in hell challenge common cultural narratives about hell and divine judgment?&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Believing in God goes beyond simply acknowledging His existence. It requires a deep faith and commitment to a relationship with Him. The Bible tells us that without faith, it is impossible to please God (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/11/Hebrews-11-6.html"&gt;Hebrews 11:6&lt;/a&gt;). So, what does it mean to believe in God?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Believing in God goes beyond simply acknowledging His existence. It requires a deep faith and commitment to a relationship with Him. The Bible tells us that without faith, it is impossible to please God (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/11/Hebrews-11-6.html"&gt;Hebrews 11:6&lt;/a&gt;). So, what does it mean to believe in God?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Acknowledging God's Existence&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first step in believing in God is acknowledging His existence. Many people around the world believe in some form of the supernatural or a higher power. However, simply believing that God exists is not enough. Even the demons believe in God's existence (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/James/2/James-2-19.html"&gt;James 2:19&lt;/a&gt;). Our belief in God should go beyond mere acknowledgement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Commitment and a Change of Life&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Believing in God should lead to a commitment and a change of life. It's not enough to believe in God without allowing that belief to transform our actions and behavior. Just like how we may believe in the importance of good diet and exercise, but fail to change our lives accordingly, many people believe in God but do not live out their faith. &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/James/1/James-1-26.html"&gt;James 1:26&lt;/a&gt; tells us that faith without actions is dead. Belief in God should inspire us to live according to His will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;True Belief Based on Who God Is&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genuine belief in God is based on who He truly is, as revealed in the Bible. Many people create their own idea of God, picking and choosing aspects that align with their preferences. But true belief requires accepting and worshiping the Triune God who is perfect, omniscient, omnipotent, all-sufficient, immutable, true, faithful, gracious, loving, merciful, holy, and just. We must align our belief with the reality of who God is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Jesus Christ as the Ultimate Revelation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FtUNQpu2b7Q" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To truly believe in God as He has revealed Himself, we must also believe in Jesus Christ. He is the radiance of God's glory and the exact representation of His being (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/1/Hebrews-1-3.html"&gt;Hebrews 1:3&lt;/a&gt;). Through Jesus, God has shown Himself to us in a way we can understand. Jesus declared that anyone who has seen Him has seen the Father, emphasizing the inseparable connection between Him and God (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/14/John-14-9.html"&gt;John 14:9&lt;/a&gt;–11). Faith in God must include faith in Jesus Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Believing in God is not just about intellectual assent. It requires a genuine relationship with Him and a commitment to live according to His will. Our belief should be based on who God truly is, as revealed in the Bible. Jesus Christ is the ultimate revelation of God, and faith in Him is essential for a true belief in God. Without this belief, we cannot honor God or have a genuine relationship with Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take a moment to reflect on your own belief in God. Is it based on who He truly is, or have you created your own version of Him? Are you living out your faith in practical ways, allowing it to transform your actions and behavior? Consider the importance of believing in Jesus Christ as the ultimate revelation of God and the key to having a genuine relationship with Him.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/Our Response to God/Seeking God"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Seeking Answers: Questioning God''s Plan in Faith</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/question-god/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-08-21T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-08-21T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-08-21:/question-god/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Questioning God&lt;/h2&gt;

It is crucial …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Questioning God&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Questioning God is a natural part of our faith journey, and it is important to understand how and why we question Him. Throughout the Bible, we see examples of individuals who questioned God in various circumstances, and God responded to them with patience and understanding. It is crucial to approach God with sincerity and an earnest heart when we have questions, seeking His wisdom and guidance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Right Way to Question God&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we question God, it is essential to do so with humility, trust, and an open mind. The prophet Habakkuk questioned God, seeking answers about His plan. Instead of rebuking Habakkuk, God patiently answered his questions, resulting in the prophet praising the Lord. Similarly, many people in the Psalms cry out to God, desperately seeking His intervention and salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus Himself encouraged us to ask, search, and knock, assuring us that we will receive what we seek if we persist. This shows that questioning God is not inherently wrong but rather a way for us to seek a deeper understanding of His will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Examples of Questioning God in the Bible&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Numerous godly individuals in the Bible expressed doubts and questioned their ability to serve God. Moses doubted his capability to lead the Israelites out of Egypt, Gideon questioned his role in God's plan, Elijah expressed uncertainty about his purpose, Jeremiah had doubts about his calling, Abraham questioned God's promises, Joshua asked about God's actions, and even the disciples had reservations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These examples demonstrate that questioning God does not necessarily indicate a lack of faith but rather a desire for clarity and reassurance. We can take comfort in knowing that even those close to God had questions and uncertainties at times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Insincere Questions and Unbelief&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While sincere questions are welcomed by God, insincere questions from a hypocritical heart are different. In the Bible, the Pharisees and Jewish leaders often posed questions to Jesus in an attempt to trick or trap Him. Jesus refused to answer these questions because they lacked sincerity and were driven by ulterior motives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unbelief is another factor that can hinder our ability to question God with sincerity. It is essential to trust in the Lord and believe in His existence and His faithfulness to reward those who earnestly seek Him. When King Saul disobeyed God, his questions went unanswered, highlighting the importance of faith and obedience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Differentiating Doubts from Attacking God's Character&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a distinction between wondering why God allows certain events to occur and directly questioning His goodness or truthfulness. Doubts are not synonymous with attacking God's sovereignty or character. Such attitudes stem from spiritual blindness, rebellion, and disobedience against God. People who do not belong to God may question His works due to their lack of understanding and faith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is crucial to approach our questions with a humble spirit, a trusting heart, and an open mind. God understands our weaknesses, fears, and uncertainties. He invites us to seek transparent fellowship with Him, knowing that our inner intentions determine whether it is right or wrong to question Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/d15Q3wxD1HY" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Maintaining Trust in God&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although God may not always answer our questions in the way we expect or desire, we can trust that He knows what is best for us. We must remember that He sees the bigger picture and has a sovereign perspective that surpasses our limited understanding. Our faith should not waver when we face unanswered questions but rather deepen as we trust in His wisdom and love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Questioning God is a significant aspect of our relationship with Him. It allows us to grow in faith, seek His guidance, and gain a deeper understanding of His will. By questioning with sincerity, humility, and trust, we foster a closer relationship with God and develop a stronger faith that can withstand doubts and uncertainties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have you ever questioned God? How did it impact your faith journey?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can you approach God with sincere questions, seeking His wisdom and guidance?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reflect on the examples of individuals in the Bible who questioned God. What can you learn from their experiences?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can you differentiate between doubts and attacking God's character? How does this understanding affect your relationship with Him?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consider the importance of maintaining trust in God, even when our questions go unanswered. How can you deepen your faith and trust in His sovereign perspective?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we engage in questioning God, let us remember to do so with a heart of humility, trust, and openness. It is through seeking His wisdom and guidance that we can grow in our faith and deepen our relationship with Him.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/Our Response to God/Honest Questions"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>God is Love: Unveiling the Divine Essence in the Bible</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/bible-teach-god-is-love/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-08-20T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-08-20T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-08-20:/bible-teach-god-is-love/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Bible Teaches That God is Love&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bible teaches that God is love, but it also reveals that He is more than just love. The apostle John emphasizes this in his letter, stating twice that God is love (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-John/4/1-John-4-8.html"&gt;1 John 4:8&lt;/a&gt;, 16). While other passages describe the love that …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Bible Teaches That God is Love&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bible teaches that God is love, but it also reveals that He is more than just love. The apostle John emphasizes this in his letter, stating twice that God is love (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-John/4/1-John-4-8.html"&gt;1 John 4:8&lt;/a&gt;, 16). While other passages describe the love that God expresses, John uniquely declares that God's essence is love. However, it is important to note that John does not imply that God is merely a concept or equal to love; rather, he consistently recognizes God as a personal being described by the attribute of love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While love is a central aspect of God's character, there are other divine attributes that are equally important. In fact, one attribute may be even more definitive of who God is. John's record in Revelation depicts a scene in heaven where four creatures continually proclaim, "Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God, the Almighty, who was and who is and who is to come" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Revelation/4/Revelation-4-8.html"&gt;Revelation 4:8&lt;/a&gt;). This scene echoes Isaiah's vision in which seraphim declare the holiness of the Lord (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/6/Isaiah-6-3.html"&gt;Isaiah 6:3&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isaiah's encounter with God further reinforces the priority of His holiness. While Isaiah acknowledges God's grace, compassion, and lovingkindness, he also recognizes the supreme significance of God's holiness. This demonstrates that even God's love is defined by His holiness. Therefore, we must rely on Him to define what love truly is and how He desires us to express it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QPywCD-TSd0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, God has provided the perfect example of His love through Jesus Christ. This demonstration of love encompasses all humanity (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/3/John-3-16.html"&gt;John 3:16&lt;/a&gt;). Those who believe in Jesus are called to emulate His mindset, maintaining the same love and following His example of humility and service to others (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Philippians/2/Philippians-2-2.html"&gt;Philippians 2:2-8&lt;/a&gt;). As recipients of God's love, we are called to reciprocate by loving Him and one another (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-John/4/1-John-4-19.html"&gt;1 John 4:19&lt;/a&gt;, 20).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God is both holy and loving. His love has been expressed to the world in various ways, but most significantly through Jesus Christ. As believers, we are expected to receive His love by placing our faith in Jesus and then continue growing in our understanding of how to love God and others in a manner that aligns with His holiness (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/5/Romans-5-1.html"&gt;Romans 5:1-2&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Ephesians/3/Ephesians-3-14.html"&gt;Ephesians 3:14-19&lt;/a&gt;; 4:1). We are called to reflect both holiness and love as children of God (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-Peter/1/1-Peter-1-15.html"&gt;1 Peter 1:15-16&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-Thessalonians/4/1-Thessalonians-4-9.html"&gt;1 Thessalonians 4:9&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding that God is both love and holiness is crucial for our relationship with Him. Recognizing His holiness helps us grasp the magnitude of His love and the importance of reflecting His character in our lives. It also reminds us that love, as defined by God, goes beyond mere sentimentality or personal preference. Instead, it encompasses selflessness, sacrifice, and a commitment to holiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This understanding also shapes how we view and experience love in our relationships with others. As followers of Christ, we are called to love others with a love that mirrors God's holiness. This means being willing to put others' needs before our own, forgiving as we have been forgiven, and seeking to reflect the character of Christ in all our interactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How does understanding that God is both love and holiness impact your view of His love for you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In what ways can you reflect both holiness and love in your relationships with others?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How might your understanding of love change when you consider it through the lens of God's holiness?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reflect on the sacrificial love demonstrated by Jesus on the cross. How does this example challenge your understanding of love?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some people argue that the concept of God is merely a human fabrication, a way for us to explain things that are difficult to understand. They claim that belief in God ignores science and embraces superstition. So, is the idea of God a fantasy based on ignorance and concocted by our forefathers before science proved it to be false?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here’s the truth: God is not man-made; rather, God made man.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The First Cause&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even skeptics agree that there is a beginning for every created thing, including man. So, in order for man to have a beginning, there must be a “first cause” that existed before him. Evolutionists argue that the first cause was an impersonal force, a “big bang,” that started the universe. But even that explanation leaves a lot of unanswered questions. What caused the Big Bang? What or who put those forces into motion? No reasonable answer, outside of the Bible, has been offered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bible starts with the fact of God in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/1/Genesis-1-1.html"&gt;Genesis 1:1&lt;/a&gt;, “In the beginning God . . . .” When we set aside prejudice, the Bible’s answer seems to be the most logical explanation for that first cause. In the beginning was God. He was not created and therefore needs no first cause. He has always been and always will be, apart from time and space (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/90/Psalm-90-2.html"&gt;Psalm 90:2&lt;/a&gt;). He introduced Himself to Moses as I AM (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Exodus/3/Exodus-3-14.html"&gt;Exodus 3:14&lt;/a&gt;). The meaning of His name signifies the eternal aspect of His nature. He always was and always will be the Eternal, Self-existent One (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Revelation/1/Revelation-1-8.html"&gt;Revelation 1:8&lt;/a&gt;; 4:8).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Nature of God&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dWrEczFaygk" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another consideration is the nature of God as revealed in the Bible. Many attributes of God are not those that human beings would necessarily think to include if they had invented Him. God’s character includes omniscience, omnipotence, patience, consistency, love, faithfulness, and a desire to have a relationship with us. But He is also perfectly just, and that justice requires payment for man’s high treason against his Creator. The God of the Bible took on human flesh, lived among us, and then allowed the people He created to torture Him to death while He forgave them. That kind of selfless, sacrificial love is outside human experience and not present in any man-made religion. Grace is a concept exclusive to the God of the Bible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Man-Made Gods&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Man-made gods are usually fashioned in the image of man. The gods of pagan cultures are fraught with flaws, inconsistencies, and human-like weaknesses. They are petty, selfish, cruel, and capricious; in short, they behave as man-made gods would behave, with the same sins and jealousies found in the human heart. In order for God to be man-made, His nature could only extend as far as man’s imagination. The God of the Bible far surpasses our understanding, yet He leaves hints for us to follow as we come to know Him better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Human Soul&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every human being is unique and possesses an innate sense of “me.” We have an inborn understanding of the eternal and the sense that there is more beyond this world. &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/1/Genesis-1-27.html"&gt;Genesis 1:27&lt;/a&gt; says that human beings were fashioned in the image of God; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Colossians/1/Colossians-1-16.html"&gt;Colossians 1:16&lt;/a&gt; says we were created for His purposes and His pleasure. We were created like Him in some ways but He is not necessarily like us. If God were merely a human fabrication, then many new questions arise: What makes human beings different from animals? Where do humans get the ideas of justice, benevolence, self-sacrifice, and love—abstract qualities not found in the animal kingdom? Such traits, found in every culture in the world, would never have survived the evolutionary process. However, when we see those traits showcased within the character of God Himself, we understand why we possess them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Trustworthiness of the Bible&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to contend that God does not exist, one must deal with the accuracy of the Book that tells about Him. The Bible is a collection of books written by over 40 different authors, over a 1,500-year time span, from three continents and in three different languages. Yet it weaves together the pieces of a single story like a jigsaw puzzle. The Bible is God’s story of His relentless pursuit to redeem His fallen creation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those who believe that the idea of God is man-made must also consider the manner in which the Bible portrays mankind, especially the Jews. If the Jews wrote the Bible to honor themselves, they failed miserably. Even the Lord Himself is clear that He chose the Israelites for His own reasons, not because they were deserving of special treatment. The failures of the Israelite nation are showcased again and again, right up to the crucifixion of the Son of God. Humanity is portrayed realistically, complete with sin, rebellion, and punishment. No group or individual is exalted. This raises the obvious question: if man fabricated the idea of God, what was his motive? Throughout history, those proclaiming the Bible’s truths have been martyred, stoned, and driven into hiding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Complexity and Design of the Universe&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the idea of God is man-made, then there is no God, really, and the biggest question left unanswered relates to the complexity and apparent design of the universe. A single strand of DNA shows such intricate brilliance that random chance cannot come close to explaining it. Beyond that, billions of perfectly synchronized atoms, molecules, systems, and universes shout to us about a Designer. Removing God from the realm of possible explanations gives rise to many unanswerable questions. No other explanation makes sense. Theories abound, but none can claim definitive scientific evidence for the startling harmonization of the universe’s complexity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding that God is not man-made but rather the Creator of all things has profound implications for our lives and worldview. It means that we are not here by accident, but by design. We have purpose and value because we were intentionally created by a loving and just God. Our existence and the complexity of the universe point to a divine intelligence behind it all. Recognizing this truth helps us find meaning, purpose, and hope in a world that often seems chaotic and confusing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's important to critically examine the claims that God is man-made and evaluate the evidence presented. Consider the logical arguments for the existence of God and the nature of humanity. Reflect on your own experiences and understanding of justice, love, and morality. Explore the trustworthiness of the Bible and its portrayal of mankind and God. Contemplate the complexity and design of the universe. Engage in open-minded exploration of these topics, seeking truth wherever it may lead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember, faith in God is not blind belief; it is based on reason, evidence, and personal experience. By seeking to understand more about God's existence and His role in our lives, we can deepen our relationship with Him and find greater purpose and fulfillment.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/The Identity of God/The Faulty Assumptions"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Discover the Healing Power of Jehovah Rapha: A Christian''s Guide</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/jehovah-rapha/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-08-20T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-08-20T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-08-20:/jehovah-rapha/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Jehovah Rapha: The Lord Who Heals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jehovah-Rapha, also known as Yahweh-Rapha, is one of the many names of God found in the Old Testament. In Hebrew, Jehovah-Rapha means "The Lord Who Heals." This name appears in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Exodus/15/Exodus-15-26.html"&gt;Exodus 15:26&lt;/a&gt; when God speaks to the Israelites and declares, "If you listen …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Jehovah Rapha: The Lord Who Heals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jehovah-Rapha, also known as Yahweh-Rapha, is one of the many names of God found in the Old Testament. In Hebrew, Jehovah-Rapha means "The Lord Who Heals." This name appears in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Exodus/15/Exodus-15-26.html"&gt;Exodus 15:26&lt;/a&gt; when God speaks to the Israelites and declares, "If you listen carefully to the Lord your God and do what is right in his eyes, if you pay attention to his commands and keep all his decrees, I will not bring on you any of the diseases I brought on the Egyptians, for I am the Lord, who heals you."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Context of Jehovah-Rapha&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The revelation of God's name Jehovah-Rapha took place early on in the wilderness wanderings of the Israelites. After leaving Egypt and crossing the Red Sea, Moses led them into the Desert of Shur. For three days, they traveled without finding water (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Exodus/15/Exodus-15-22.html"&gt;Exodus 15:22&lt;/a&gt;). This was a test of their faith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soon after, they came across a body of water, but it was bitter and undrinkable. They named it Marah, meaning "bitter." The Israelites started grumbling against Moses, questioning what they would drink. Moses prayed to the Lord, who showed him a piece of wood. Moses threw it into the water as instructed by God, and miraculously, the water became sweet and fit to drink.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was after this healing of the bitter waters that God revealed Himself as Jehovah-Rapha to the Israelites. He declared, "I am the Lord, who heals you" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Exodus/15/Exodus-15-26.html"&gt;Exodus 15:26&lt;/a&gt;). This name signifies that God not only has the power to heal physical ailments but also to overcome impurity and corruption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Promise of Healing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along with revealing His name Jehovah-Rapha, God promised the Israelites that He would not bring upon them the diseases that afflicted the Egyptians. This promise referred to the ten plagues that God had sent upon Egypt, including boils, death of livestock, and devastating hail. However, this promise was conditional, requiring the Israelites to diligently listen to the voice of the Lord, do what is right in His eyes, and keep His commandments and statutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Jehovah-Rapha's Healing Power&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jehovah-Rapha has the power to heal physically, emotionally, mentally, and spiritually. In the Old Testament, we see instances where God healed physical ailments such as leprosy (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/2-Kings/5/2-Kings-5-10.html"&gt;2 Kings 5:10&lt;/a&gt;), provided comfort in times of distress (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/34/Psalm-34-18.html"&gt;Psalm 34:18&lt;/a&gt;), restored sanity (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Daniel/4/Daniel-4-34.html"&gt;Daniel 4:34&lt;/a&gt;), and forgave sins (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/103/Psalm-103-2.html"&gt;Psalm 103:2&lt;/a&gt;–3).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus Christ, the incarnation of God, showed Himself to be the ultimate expression of Jehovah-Rapha. During His ministry on Earth, Jesus traveled from town to town in Galilee, healing every disease and sickness among the people (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/4/Matthew-4-23.html"&gt;Matthew 4:23&lt;/a&gt;). Large crowds followed Him in Judea, where He healed them (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/19/Matthew-19-2.html"&gt;Matthew 19:2&lt;/a&gt;). Everywhere He went, people brought their sick to Him, and all who touched even the edge of His cloak were healed (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/6/Mark-6-56.html"&gt;Mark 6:56&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus not only healed people physically but also brought spiritual healing through forgiveness of sins. He demonstrated Himself as Jehovah-Rapha in the flesh. Every day and in every way, Jesus proved that He is the Lord who heals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HI0kRYhqKbc" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The name Jehovah-Rapha reminds us of God's healing power. It assures us that God is not only concerned with our physical well-being but also desires to heal our brokenness in every aspect of our lives. Whether we are facing physical ailments, emotional distress, mental struggles, or spiritual emptiness, we can turn to Jehovah-Rapha for restoration and healing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowing God as Jehovah-Rapha can bring comfort and hope, especially in times of hardship and suffering. It reminds us that God is not distant or unconcerned but intimately involved in our lives. He is present to provide healing and restoration when we seek Him with faith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In what areas of your life do you need the healing touch of Jehovah-Rapha? Take a moment to reflect on any physical, emotional, mental, or spiritual needs you have and bring them before God in prayer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider the condition of your heart and soul. Are there any areas where bitterness or impurity has taken root? Ask Jehovah-Rapha to heal and purify those areas, so you can experience His fullness and restoration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take time to meditate on the healing miracles performed by Jesus during His earthly ministry. Reflect on how those miracles exemplify the character of Jehovah-Rapha and the compassion of our Savior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can you trust in Jehovah-Rapha's healing power more fully? Consider seeking godly counsel, praying for divine intervention, or turning to Scripture for encouragement and guidance during times of need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To understand whether God has free will, we first need to define what we mean by "free will." For the purpose of this discussion, we will define free will as "the capacity of a conscious mind to make decisions and choices without any external constraints or coercion."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on this definition, we can say that God certainly possesses free will. God has a mind, is conscious, and has the capacity to make decisions and choices. He does not answer to any authority, is not limited by any external constraints, and cannot be coerced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God created human beings with a form of free will as well. It is part of what distinguishes us from rocks and animals. However, the volition we possess is of a lesser sort than God's. Unlike humans, God has completely free will in the sense that He is not limited by anything apart from Himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Limited Free Will for Humans&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Human beings have a certain aspect of decision-making that is unconstrained by natural laws. Many events in the world are determined by natural laws, such as objects falling due to gravity or animals following their instincts. However, our choices in matters like what shoes to wear or what breakfast to order are not governed by these natural laws.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While humans have a limited autonomy within the natural world, there are always limitations on our choices. We cannot choose to do things that are physically impossible, like flapping our arms and flying to the moon. Therefore, human beings have a form of free will that is constrained by external factors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;God's Unconstrained Free Will&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast to humans, God's free will is unconstrained in every aspect. The natural world operates subsidiary to His realm. He is not bound by natural laws; in fact, He established those laws and is sovereign over them. God could have created the universe in any number of ways, but the way it exists is due to His choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even the act of creation itself was the result of God's free will. His choice to create was not influenced by any necessity or obligation. God's volition is absolute; His actions are neither deterministically constrained nor controlled by someone else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Fed9hwmJNSE" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;God's Intrinsic Nature and Limitations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While God has complete free will, there are certain things that He is incapable of doing because of His perfect and holy nature. For example, &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Titus/1/Titus-1-2.html"&gt;Titus 1:2&lt;/a&gt; states that God "cannot lie." This limitation does not suggest any external control but rather identifies an intrinsic property of God's own character. God cannot be unfaithful to Himself, break His Word, or be less than perfect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, there are certain things that God is incapable of doing because of the very nature of reality. For instance, He cannot make a triangular square. These statements reflect the fact that God does not deal in absurdities or fallacies but operates within the bounds of reality that He established.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God's inability to lie or sin or engage in illogical actions does not diminish His freedom in any way. Instead, it is a result of His own intrinsic nature. External influences have no hold on Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding whether God has free will has important implications for our understanding of His nature and sovereignty. Recognizing that God possesses free will helps us grasp His absolute authority and control over all things. It highlights the fact that He is not subject to external constraints or limitations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, acknowledging our own limited free will humbles us before God and reminds us of our dependence on Him. It reinforces the truth that we are creatures created by God and subject to His authority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Think About It&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reflect on the concept of free will as defined in this article. How does this definition align with your understanding of free will?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider the limitations on human free will discussed in this article. How do these limitations affect your perspective on the choices you make?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does it mean for God to have complete free will? How does this understanding impact your view of God's sovereignty and authority?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reflect on the idea that God's inability to lie or sin is a result of His perfect and holy nature. How does this reinforce your trust in His character?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can a deeper understanding of God's free will and our limited free will impact how we approach decision-making and submit to God's authority in our lives?&lt;/p&gt;

This dilemma has troubled believers throughout history, and it reflects the age-old question of why God allows injustice in the world. In Psalm …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Good Things Happening to Bad People: Understanding God's Perspective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Christians, we may often find ourselves questioning why it seems like good things happen to bad people. This dilemma has troubled believers throughout history, and it reflects the age-old question of why God allows injustice in the world. In Psalm 73, the psalmist Asaph grapples with this very issue. He observes the prosperity and seeming lack of struggles of the wicked and begins to question the fairness of it all. Asaph's struggle resonates with us today, as we may also witness ungodly individuals experiencing success and abundance while we face difficulties in our own lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1. The Envy of the Prosperous Wicked&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asaph, a dedicated servant of God, envied the wicked due to their apparent prosperity and freedom from troubles. He saw them enjoying wealth, health, and material possessions while he struggled to make ends meet. This led him to question why God would allow such injustice to occur. It is a common experience for believers to feel disheartened when they see ungodly individuals seemingly thriving while they face hardships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2. Seeking Understanding in God's Presence&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his distress, Asaph sought understanding by entering into the sanctuary of God. It was in His presence that he gained insight into the true destiny of the wicked. Asaph realized that their prosperity was temporary and illusory. Although they may have earthly riches, they lacked the true riches of eternal life in God. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we feel envious or discouraged by the success of ungodly individuals, we must remember that their prosperity is fleeting. True fulfillment and everlasting joy can only be found in a relationship with God through Jesus Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Think About It:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider the times when you have compared your life to that of others who seem to be prospering despite their ungodliness. How does knowing that their prosperity is temporary change your perspective?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;3. The Deception of Earthly Prosperity&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asaph came to understand that the wicked's prosperity was a deception orchestrated by Satan, the ancient deceiver. He had used lies to distract Asaph from the reality of God and to make him question the fairness of his own circumstances. The temporary fulfillment provided by earthly prosperity is comparable to a pleasant dream that fades upon waking. Asaph rebuked himself for being senseless and ignorant in his envy, realizing that true joy and spiritual prosperity are found in a relationship with God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;4. The Ultimate Destiny of the Wicked&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Entering into God's presence allowed Asaph to grasp the final destiny of the wicked. He understood that those who reject God and choose a life of ungodliness are on slippery ground, destined for ruin. The seeming prosperity they enjoy in this life will be abruptly shattered, and they will face destruction and terror. In contrast, those who remain faithful to God will find refuge in Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the ultimate destiny of the wicked helps us to see beyond their temporary success and recognize the eternal consequences of their choices. It reminds us of the importance of staying faithful to God, even when we face hardships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Think About It:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reflect on the choices you have witnessed ungodly individuals making and consider how those choices may impact their eternal destiny. How does this knowledge affect your perspective on their temporary successes?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IKOeL8OxGzo" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;5. Finding Contentment in God's Presence&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asaph's journey into God's presence brought him back to a place of contentment and joy in God alone. He realized that nothing on earth could compare to having a relationship with God. Earthly desires and pursuits pale in comparison to the fulfillment found in knowing and serving our Creator. Asaph declared that it is good to be near God and made Him his refuge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;6. The Narrow Road to Eternal Life&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Christians, we may not always have everything we desire in this world. However, our hope lies in the eternal life promised through Jesus Christ. When we are tempted to envy the temporary prosperity of the wicked, we must remember that their path leads to destruction. Instead, we should focus on the narrow road that leads to eternal life with God. This perspective should bring us joy and comfort, knowing that true riches and everlasting fulfillment are found in Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the narrow road that leads to eternal life reminds us to prioritize our relationship with God over earthly desires. It encourages us to persevere in faith, even when faced with the seeming successes of those who reject God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Think About It:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider the ways in which you prioritize your relationship with God in your daily life. How can you strengthen your commitment to the narrow road that leads to eternal life?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dilemma of good things happening to bad people has troubled believers throughout history. Asaph's experience in Psalm 73 provides valuable insights into this issue. When we witness ungodly individuals seemingly prospering while we face difficulties, we need to seek understanding in God's presence. By entering into His sanctuary, we gain perspective on the temporary nature of earthly prosperity and the ultimate destiny of the wicked. We find contentment and joy in knowing and serving God, recognizing that true fulfillment is found in Him alone. Our focus should remain on the narrow road that leads to eternal life through Jesus Christ, rather than being envious of temporary worldly success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Christians, it is important for us to remember that our ultimate goal is not earthly prosperity, but a relationship with God and eternal life. By keeping our focus on Him and seeking His wisdom and understanding, we can find contentment and peace even in the face of the seeming success of the wicked. Rather than being discouraged or envious, let us trust in God's plan and continue to walk faithfully on the narrow road that leads to eternal life.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/God and Evil/Hardships"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Unveiling the Divine Mystery of the Economic Trinity - Understanding the Godhead</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/economic-trinity/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-08-16T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-08-16T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-08-16:/economic-trinity/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;The Economic Trinity: Understanding the Roles within the Trinity&lt;/h2&gt;

In this …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;The Economic Trinity: Understanding the Roles within the Trinity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept of the Trinity is one of the most profound and mysterious teachings in Christianity. While it may be difficult to fully comprehend, understanding the different roles within the Trinity can provide insight into the nature of God. In this article, we will explore the idea of the "economic Trinity" and how it relates to the unique relationships among the three Persons of the Trinity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What is the Economic Trinity?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The term "economic Trinity" is not found in Scripture, but it is a theological concept that helps us understand the roles and relationships within the Trinity. The word "economic" comes from the Greek word meaning "household management" or "organization." In this context, it refers to the assigning of roles and responsibilities within the family of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The economic Trinity is often discussed in contrast to the "ontological Trinity." While the economic Trinity focuses on the roles and functions of each Person, the ontological Trinity emphasizes their co-equal nature. Both concepts are important in understanding how God can be both united and distinct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Distinctions within the Economic Trinity&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scripture reveals that there are distinctions among the three Persons of the Trinity. Each Person has a unique role in accomplishing God's purposes, particularly in relation to our salvation. For example, our salvation is based on the Father's power and love, the Son's death and resurrection, and the Spirit's work of regeneration and sealing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These different tasks performed by each Person help us grasp the concept of the economic Trinity. They demonstrate that while all three Persons are fully God and share one nature, they also have distinct roles within their divine work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aZiBn5fdDAM" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Voluntary Subordination within the Trinity&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another aspect of the economic Trinity is voluntary subordination. This means that even though all three Persons of the Trinity are ontologically equal, they willingly submit to one another in their roles and relationships. The Father "sent" the Son, the Father and the Son "send" the Spirit, and the Spirit speaks only what He hears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This voluntary subordination within the Trinity does not imply any inferiority or superiority among the Persons. Rather, it reveals the perfect unity and harmony that exists within the Godhead. It is a beautiful picture of love and fellowship, which we are invited to experience through our relationship with God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Perfect Love and Fellowship within the Economic Trinity&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The relationships within the economic Trinity provide a glimpse into the perfect love and fellowship that exist within God Himself. The Father, Son, and Holy Spirit have eternally existed in perfect unity, love, and cooperation. Their relationship is characterized by selfless love, mutual submission, and perfect harmony.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This perfect love and fellowship are what all humanity longs for deep down. We were created to experience this kind of intimate relationship with God. Through His love, God draws us into fellowship with Himself, inviting us to share in the divine life and love that exists within the Trinity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the economic Trinity helps us grasp the incredible depth and complexity of God's nature. It reminds us that God is not an impersonal force or distant deity but a loving community of Persons. This understanding also highlights the importance of relationships in our own lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we recognize the perfect love and fellowship within the Trinity, we are inspired to pursue deeper relationships with one another. We are called to reflect this love and unity in our interactions with others, seeking to build up one another in love and selflessness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider how the concept of the economic Trinity challenges any misconceptions you may have about God's nature. How does it deepen your understanding of who God is?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reflect on the voluntary subordination within the Trinity. How can this help you understand humility and submission in your own life? In what ways can you emulate the selfless love and cooperation displayed within the Trinity?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meditate on the perfect love and fellowship within the Trinity. How does this inspire you to pursue deeper relationships with God and with others? How can you foster a spirit of unity and harmony in your interactions with those around you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we seek to understand the economic Trinity, let us approach this profound mystery with awe and reverence. May it deepen our love for God and our appreciation for the relationships He has called us to cultivate.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/The Nature of God/The Trinity"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Experiencing God''s Pleasure: The Ultimate Joy for Christian Believers</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/god-pleasure/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-08-16T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-08-16T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-08-16:/god-pleasure/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;God's Pleasure: Finding Joy in the Creator's Design&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our understanding of God, it is important to recognize that He is not a stern taskmaster opposed to all fun or pleasure. Contrary to this misconception, the Bible paints a different picture of God—a God who created us with the ability to experience delight and pleasure. Scripture speaks of our enjoyment and pleasure in various contexts, such as Psalm 16, &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Proverbs/17/Proverbs-17-22.html"&gt;Proverbs 17:22&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Proverbs/15/Proverbs-15-13.html"&gt;Proverbs 15:13&lt;/a&gt;. These verses reveal that God desires His creation to be enjoyed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God Himself takes pleasure in things, as seen in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Zephaniah/3/Zephaniah-3-17.html"&gt;Zephaniah 3:17&lt;/a&gt; where it states that He delights in us and sings over us. Additionally, God instituted celebrations and festivals in the Old Testament which were not only didactic but also intended for joyous celebration. Joy is a recurring theme in Scripture, evident in books like Philippians and Psalms. Jesus Himself declared that He came so that we may have life to the full (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/10/John-10-10.html"&gt;John 10:10&lt;/a&gt;). This abundant life implies a pleasurable experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, when we consider the design of the human body, we can see that pleasure is part of God's plan. Our taste buds and sensory organs testify to the fact that God is not opposed to pleasure. The enjoyment we derive from food, the pleasant scent of roses, or the satisfaction of a massage is evidence of God's intention for pleasure. He designed these experiences to bring delight into our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to distinguish between different types of pleasures in this world. We live in a fallen world where what society deems pleasurable does not always align with what is pleasing to God. &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Galatians/5/Galatians-5-19.html"&gt;Galatians 5:19-21&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Colossians/3/Colossians-3-5.html"&gt;Colossians 3:5-10&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-Corinthians/6/1-Corinthians-6-12.html"&gt;1 Corinthians 6:12-17&lt;/a&gt; caution against indulging in worldly pleasures that are ultimately destructive. The story of the prodigal son in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/15/Luke-15-11.html"&gt;Luke 15:11-17&lt;/a&gt; exemplifies how fleeting and empty worldly pleasures can be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, it is crucial to note that the purpose of our lives is not solely focused on pleasure. Hedonism, the pursuit of pleasure as the ultimate goal, is a false philosophy. Instead, we were created to find delight in God (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/37/Psalm-37-4.html"&gt;Psalm 37:4&lt;/a&gt;) and to gratefully accept the good things He provides. Above all, our primary purpose is to have a relationship with God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary, God is not opposed to pleasure per se. He is opposed to pleasure taking His place in our lives. Sometimes, we are called to forgo momentary pleasures in order to invest in the greater joy of God's kingdom. By seeking Him and His righteousness, we can experience the eternal pleasures that He has in store for us (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/16/Psalm-16-11.html"&gt;Psalm 16:11&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QPywCD-TSd0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding God's perspective on pleasure helps us navigate the complexities of life. It enables us to discern between healthy and unhealthy pleasures, guiding us towards choices that align with God's will. Recognizing that God delights in us and desires our enjoyment helps counter the misconception that Christianity is solely about following rules or denying ourselves joy. Embracing the biblical concept of pleasure brings a sense of freedom and fulfillment as we engage with the world around us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does your understanding of God's view on pleasure affect your own pursuit of joy?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are there any pleasures in your life that you feel might be taking precedence over your relationship with God?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In what ways can you actively seek and cultivate the eternal pleasures that God has in store for you?&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The phrase "God is the Rock of my salvation" appears multiple times in the Old Testament, emphasizing the trustworthiness and security that God provides. In biblical times, rocky areas were often used as hiding places from enemies and as fortresses for protection. The Israelites found comfort in referring to God as their Rock of salvation, knowing that He was their ultimate refuge. The psalms, particularly those written by David, are filled with declarations of God as the Rock of salvation, highlighting the deep faith and confidence in God's deliverance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Trusting in God's Protection&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout the Old Testament, the idea of God as the Rock of salvation meant finding deliverance from various physical dangers such as enemies, diseases, and other threats. Hannah rejoiced in God's salvation when He delivered her from barrenness, allowing her husband's name to continue through future generations. This understanding of salvation was primarily focused on physical liberation within the earthly realm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Enlarged Meaning&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the biblical narrative progresses, the meaning of God as the Rock of salvation expands. Prophecies in Isaiah and Psalms point towards a future cornerstone that would provide a sure foundation for those who rely on it. These prophecies foreshadow the coming of the Messiah but do not explicitly reveal that God would become flesh in Jesus Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QEaUvcHQgIc" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Jesus: The Ultimate Rock of Salvation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the New Testament, Jesus fulfills the prophecies and becomes the ultimate Rock of salvation. Although His disciples initially did not fully grasp His identity as the Savior, His life, death, and resurrection removed all doubt. Jesus is referred to as the stone rejected by builders but has become the cornerstone. His disciples boldly proclaimed this truth after receiving the Holy Spirit on the day of Pentecost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Significance for Believers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding Jesus as the Rock of salvation is crucial for Christians. It goes beyond physical deliverance and encompasses the ultimate spiritual deliverance that God provides through Jesus Christ. Believers can find refuge, security, and hope in Jesus, who is the foundation of their faith and the source of eternal life. Trusting in Him ensures that believers will never be put to shame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recognizing God as the Rock of salvation is essential because it reminds believers of their dependence on Him. It reinforces the truth that salvation comes from God alone, not from any earthly possessions or accomplishments. Trusting in God's deliverance gives believers a solid foundation to build their lives upon and a steadfast hope for the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider the times when you have faced challenges or difficulties in your life. How did you respond? Did you rely on your own strength or seek refuge in God as your Rock of salvation? Reflecting on these experiences can deepen your understanding of God's faithfulness and help you grow in your trust in Him. Take time to meditate on the certainty and security that comes from placing your hope in Jesus, the ultimate Rock of salvation.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/The Identity of God/The Titles of God"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Unlocking the Power of Jehovah: A Christian Guide for Divine Understanding</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/jehovah/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-08-14T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-08-14T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-08-14:/jehovah/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Jehovah: Understanding the Name of God&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Hebrew Scriptures, the name of God is recorded as יהוה (YHWH), also known as the tetragrammaton. However, due to the nature of written Hebrew at the time, which did not include vowels, scholars and linguists are unsure about the exact pronunciation of …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Jehovah: Understanding the Name of God&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Hebrew Scriptures, the name of God is recorded as יהוה (YHWH), also known as the tetragrammaton. However, due to the nature of written Hebrew at the time, which did not include vowels, scholars and linguists are unsure about the exact pronunciation of this name. Some proposed pronunciations include "Yahweh," "Yehowah," "Yahuweh," or even "Jehovah." While there is ongoing debate about the correct pronunciation, it is important to note that the vast majority of Jewish and Christian biblical scholars do not consider "Jehovah" to be the proper pronunciation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1. The Challenge of Pronunciation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ancient Hebrew did not have a system for recording vowels in its written form. Vowel sounds were passed down orally, leading to uncertainty about how certain Hebrew words were pronounced. This becomes particularly relevant when studying the name of God. The tetragrammaton, YHWH, was written without vowels, making it challenging to determine its original pronunciation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2. Different Proposed Pronunciations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scholars and linguists have put forward various pronunciations for the tetragrammaton, including "Yahweh," "Yehowah," "Yahuweh," and "Jehovah." Each proposed pronunciation has its own arguments and considerations. However, it is important to recognize that there is no definitive consensus on the correct pronunciation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;3. The Use of "Jehovah"&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/B_64Y3c9cvk" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While "Jehovah" is widely used in some translations of the Bible, such as the King James Version, it is not considered the most accurate pronunciation by most scholars. The term "Jehovah" originated from a Germanic pronunciation of the Latinized transliteration of the tetragrammaton with vowels inserted. It is not an authentic Hebrew pronunciation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;4. Importance of Knowing God&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the debate about the correct pronunciation of the tetragrammaton is interesting, it is not crucial to the Christian faith. The Old and New Testaments use various terms for God, such as "God," "Lord," and other titles. These terms were inspired by God and are sufficient for us to refer to Him. The most important aspect is to know God through faith in Jesus Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the challenges associated with pronouncing the tetragrammaton can help us appreciate the complexity of ancient Hebrew and the difficulties scholars face in reconstructing its pronunciation. It also highlights the importance of focusing on our relationship with God rather than getting caught up in debates about names and pronunciations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider how your understanding of God might be affected if His name were pronounced differently. Does it change the way you relate to Him or understand His character? Reflect on the fact that God's nature and attributes remain constant, regardless of how we pronounce His name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, while the pronunciation of the tetragrammaton remains uncertain, it is not essential to our faith. What matters most is our relationship with God through Jesus Christ. As Christians, we can refer to Him as "God" or "Lord" without undermining the truth and significance of His divine nature. Let us focus on knowing and worshiping Him rather than becoming entangled in debates about names and pronunciations.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/The Identity of God/The Names of God"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Unveiling the Almighty Power: Understanding God''s Omnipotence in Christian Faith</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/god-omnipotent/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-08-13T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-08-13T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-08-13:/god-omnipotent/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;God's Omnipotence&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Christianity, one of the attributes ascribed to God is omnipotence, which means having all power. This concept is derived from the combination of the Latin words "omni," meaning "all," and "potens," meaning "power." It follows that if God is infinite and sovereign, then He must also be …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;God's Omnipotence&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Christianity, one of the attributes ascribed to God is omnipotence, which means having all power. This concept is derived from the combination of the Latin words "omni," meaning "all," and "potens," meaning "power." It follows that if God is infinite and sovereign, then He must also be omnipotent. God has all power over all things at all times and in all ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Creation and Preservation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the clearest demonstrations of God's omnipotence is seen in the act of creation. In the book of Genesis, God spoke into existence everything that exists today. Unlike humans who require tools and materials to create, God simply spoke, and by the power of His word, everything came into being out of nothing. The psalmist affirms this when he says, "By the word of the LORD were the heavens made, their starry host by the breath of his mouth" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/33/Psalm-33-6.html"&gt;Psalm 33:6&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, God's power extends to the preservation of His creation. Every aspect of life on earth is sustained by God's continual provision. He provides us with food, clothing, and shelter, all from renewable resources sustained by His power as the preserver of mankind and animals (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/36/Psalm-36-6.html"&gt;Psalm 36:6&lt;/a&gt;). Even the vast seas are under His control, as He sets their limits so they do not overwhelm us (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Job/38/Job-38-8.html"&gt;Job 38:8-11&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Power Over Governments and Leaders&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God's omnipotence also extends to governments and leaders. He has the ability to restrain or allow them to go their own way according to His plans and purposes. The prophet Daniel acknowledges this when he says, "He changes times and seasons; he deposes kings and raises up others" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Daniel/2/Daniel-2-21.html"&gt;Daniel 2:21&lt;/a&gt;). Even Satan and his demons are subject to God's unlimited power. Satan's attack on Job was limited to certain actions because he was restrained by God's power (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Job/1/Job-1-12.html"&gt;Job 1:12&lt;/a&gt;; 2:6). Jesus Himself reminded Pontius Pilate that the power Pilate had over Him was granted to him by God (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/19/John-19-11.html"&gt;John 19:11&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/I0nXG02tpDw" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Limitations on God's Power&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While God is omnipotent, there are certain things that He cannot do because they are contrary to His holy character. For example, the Bible teaches that God cannot lie (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Numbers/23/Numbers-23-19.html"&gt;Numbers 23:19&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Titus/1/Titus-1-2.html"&gt;Titus 1:2&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/6/Hebrews-6-18.html"&gt;Hebrews 6:18&lt;/a&gt;). Lying goes against His moral perfection. Similarly, although God is all-powerful and hates evil, He allows evil to happen according to His good purpose. He uses certain evil events to accomplish His plans, such as allowing the killing of Jesus Christ for the redemption of mankind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Jesus Christ's Omnipotence&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As God incarnate, Jesus Christ is also omnipotent. His power was evident in the miracles He performed during His earthly ministry. From healing the sick and feeding thousands of people with a few loaves and fishes to calming storms and raising the dead, Jesus displayed His control over life and death (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/6/Mark-6-30.html"&gt;Mark 6:30-44&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/4/Mark-4-37.html"&gt;Mark 4:37-41&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/11/John-11-38.html"&gt;John 11:38-44&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/5/Mark-5-35.html"&gt;Mark 5:35-43&lt;/a&gt;). Ultimately, Jesus came to destroy death itself and bring sinners into a right relationship with God (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-Corinthians/15/1-Corinthians-15-22.html"&gt;1 Corinthians 15:22&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/2/Hebrews-2-14.html"&gt;Hebrews 2:14&lt;/a&gt;). He willingly sacrificed Himself on the cross, even though He had the power to call upon legions of angels for protection (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/26/Matthew-26-53.html"&gt;Matthew 26:53&lt;/a&gt;). Through His death and resurrection, Jesus demonstrated His ultimate power over sin and death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Believers Sharing in God's Power&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The amazing truth is that believers who are united with God through Jesus Christ can share in His power. The apostle Paul recognized this when he said, "Therefore I will boast all the more gladly about my weaknesses, so that Christ’s power may rest on me" (2 Corinthians 12:9b). When we are at our weakest, God's power is most evident in us. He is able to do more than we can ask or imagine by His power at work within us (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Ephesians/3/Ephesians-3-20.html"&gt;Ephesians 3:20&lt;/a&gt;). Despite our sin, it is God's power that keeps us in a state of grace (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/2-Timothy/1/2-Timothy-1-12.html"&gt;2 Timothy 1:12&lt;/a&gt;), and it is His power that keeps us from falling (Jude 24). Throughout eternity, the host of heaven will proclaim God's power (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Revelation/19/Revelation-19-1.html"&gt;Revelation 19:1&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding God's omnipotence is crucial for believers because it reminds us of His sovereignty and control over all things. It reassures us that nothing is beyond God's reach or ability. It encourages us to trust in His power to accomplish His purposes in our lives and in the world. Recognizing God's omnipotence also helps us to surrender our weaknesses and allow Christ's power to work through us, displaying His glory to others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reflect on times when you have seen or experienced God's power in your life. How did it affect your faith and trust in Him?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consider how recognizing God's omnipotence can bring comfort and assurance in difficult circumstances.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In what ways can you allow Christ's power to work through your weaknesses? How might this impact your daily life and relationships?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, God's omnipotence is an essential aspect of His character. He has all power over all things at all times and in all ways. From creation to preservation, from governments to miracles, God's power is evident throughout the Bible. As believers, we have the privilege of sharing in His power through our union with Jesus Christ. Recognizing God's omnipotence strengthens our faith, encourages us to trust in His sovereign control, and empowers us to live for His glory.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/The Nature of God/Attributes"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Discover the Divine Revelation of God the Mother in Christianity</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/god-the-mother/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-08-13T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-08-13T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-08-13:/god-the-mother/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;God the Mother&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Christianity, the nature of God is often referred to using masculine terms, such as "Father." However, it is important to understand that God does not have a physical body and therefore does not possess gender in the same way humans do. Scripture consistently refers to God as our heavenly Father and never as a heavenly Mother.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;God Described in Motherly Terms&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although God is primarily referred to as Father, there are instances in Scripture where He describes Himself in motherly terms. For example, there are verses that depict God comforting and feeding His children, similar to what a mother would do (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Hosea/11/Hosea-11-3.html"&gt;Hosea 11:3&lt;/a&gt;–4; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Deuteronomy/32/Deuteronomy-32-18.html"&gt;Deuteronomy 32:18&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/42/Isaiah-42-14.html"&gt;Isaiah 42:14&lt;/a&gt;; 49:15; 66:13). Additionally, there are verses that speak of God gathering His children under His wings for protection, like a mother bird (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/91/Psalm-91-4.html"&gt;Psalm 91:4&lt;/a&gt;). However, it is important to note that even in these instances, masculine pronouns are used to refer to God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Significance of Fatherhood&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it is true that God exhibits some qualities typically associated with mothers, it is crucial to recognize that He is still referred to as Father. This distinction matters because "Father" is a biblical term, while "Mother" is not. The idea of "God as mother" often arises in discussions about gender roles and equality defined in the Bible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bible teaches that both men and women are made in the image of God and are equal before Him in sin and salvation (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/1/Genesis-1-28.html"&gt;Genesis 1:28&lt;/a&gt;). However, God has assigned different yet complementary roles to men and women. Men are designated as leaders in the home and church, and they bear responsibility for how they exercise their authority. As the Ultimate Leader, God's position is best conveyed through masculine terms such as Father and Lord rather than Mother or Lady. Throughout the Bible, God reveals Himself as male and is consistently referred to using male pronouns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Gender Roles and Patriarchy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Q0LhGhJDXtA" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some evangelical Christians reject the idea of gender roles and male headship, arguing that the patriarchal society in which Scripture was written influenced its language but does not carry divine endorsement. However, those who hold this view typically do not go so far as to refer to God as "Mother." The idea of God the Mother is commonly advocated by individuals outside the evangelical camp who view the Bible as a human work reinforcing patriarchal systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A well-known Bible translator was once approached by someone suggesting feminine pronouns be used for God in the translation. In response, the translator asked if feminine pronouns should also be used to refer to the devil: "Resist the devil and she will flee from you." This rejoinder highlights the inconsistency of changing pronouns for God while retaining masculine language for other spiritual beings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Importance of Knowing God as Father&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is unfortunate that many fathers have failed to live up to their God-given responsibilities, leading some people to struggle with the concept of God as Father. In such cases, it is essential to get to know God the Father as He truly is, rather than substituting Him with the idea of God as Mother.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding and accepting the biblical portrayal of God as Father has theological significance. It aligns with how God has chosen to reveal Himself in Scripture and affirms His authority and leadership. Embracing this perspective helps us comprehend our own roles as men and women in relation to God's design and purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Think About It&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider your own understanding of God's nature. How does viewing Him primarily as Father influence your perception of His character and authority? How might recognizing God's fatherhood impact your understanding of gender roles within society and the church?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, while there are instances in Scripture where God describes Himself using motherly terms, it is important to understand that God does not have a physical gender. He is consistently referred to as Father throughout the Bible, and this term is biblically significant. While some may challenge traditional gender roles, referring to God as Mother goes beyond the biblical framework. It is crucial for Christians to embrace God's self-revelation as Father and recognize the importance of understanding and accepting His divine leadership.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/The Identity of God/The Faulty Assumptions"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Discover the Transcendent Nature: God is Spirit Unveiled</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/god-is-spirit/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-08-11T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-08-11T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-08-11:/god-is-spirit/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;God is Spirit&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bible teaches us that "God is spirit" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/4/John-4-24.html"&gt;John 4:24&lt;/a&gt;). This statement was made by Jesus to a woman who had questions about the proper way to worship God. It means that God the Father does not have a human body like we do. While Jesus …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;God is Spirit&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bible teaches us that "God is spirit" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/4/John-4-24.html"&gt;John 4:24&lt;/a&gt;). This statement was made by Jesus to a woman who had questions about the proper way to worship God. It means that God the Father does not have a human body like we do. While Jesus, as the Son of God, came to earth in human form, God the Father did not take on a physical body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to note that when the Bible sometimes speaks of God using terms like "hand," "ear," or "eyes," it is using anthropomorphism—a figurative language technique that describes God in terms humans can better understand. These descriptions should not be taken literally but rather help us comprehend certain aspects of God's character.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saying that God is spirit also means that He is invisible. &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Colossians/1/Colossians-1-15.html"&gt;Colossians 1:15&lt;/a&gt; refers to Him as the "invisible God," and &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-Timothy/1/1-Timothy-1-17.html"&gt;1 Timothy 1:17&lt;/a&gt; praises Him as the "immortal, invisible, the only God." Although God is spirit and invisible, He is a living and personal being. We can have a personal relationship with Him and know Him intimately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Nature of God&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God being spirit is essential for understanding His nature. If God had a physical body, He would be limited by time and space. However, as a spirit, He transcends these limitations and can exist in all places simultaneously. This concept helps us grasp His omnipresence—His ability to be present everywhere at once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EKibbFBmD94" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, God's spiritual nature allows us to understand His infiniteness. Being infinite means that there are no restrictions or boundaries on His existence. If God had a physical body, He would be limited in some way. But as a spirit, He is limitless and unbound by any physical or created constraints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Worshiping in Spirit and Truth&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus connects the fact that God is spirit with the idea of worshiping Him in spirit and truth. Worshiping in spirit means that we engage with God from the depths of our soul, with our heart and mind fully dedicated to Him. It is a worship that goes beyond external rituals and traditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Worshiping in truth means worshiping God accurately—the way He has revealed Himself to us through His Word, the Bible. It involves aligning our beliefs and practices with the truth found in Scripture and not relying solely on our own opinions or preferences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding that God is spirit helps us grasp the nature of our relationship with Him. It reminds us that He is not confined to a physical form, but rather a living and personal being who desires to have a genuine connection with us. Recognizing His invisibility also encourages us to seek Him with faith and trust rather than relying solely on what we can see or understand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recognizing that God is spirit also invites us into a deeper understanding of worship. It challenges us to move beyond outward expressions and rituals and instead approach worship with authenticity, sincerity, and reverence. Worshiping in spirit and truth enables us to cultivate a meaningful relationship with God and experience His presence in our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Think About It&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does the concept of God being spirit impact your understanding of who He is? How does it affect your relationship with Him?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In what ways can you engage in worship that goes beyond external rituals and traditions? How can you deepen your worship experience?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reflect on your understanding of worship in truth. How can you ensure that your beliefs and practices align with the truth revealed in Scripture?&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We often hear the question of whether God is selfish or egotistical. While the Bible does not directly address this question, it is important to examine it from a biblical perspective.

&lt;p&gt;We often hear the question of whether God is selfish or egotistical. While the Bible does not directly address this question, it is important to examine it from a biblical perspective. Accusations of God's selfishness often arise from individuals who do not believe in God or who use it as an argument against the goodness of God as presented in the Bible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;God's Perfect Being&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God is the only perfect being in the entire universe, and any attention, praise, and adoration directed towards Him is completely warranted. Accusing God of selfishness stems from our own desire to occupy the place that rightfully belongs to God. It is our own selfishness that allows us to accuse God of selfishness. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;God's Self-Sufficiency&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God was completely self-sufficient and had no need to create other beings in order to find fulfillment. Within the Trinity, there existed perfect love and fellowship. The only reason God created human beings is so that we may also experience His love and perfection. Comparing God's alleged selfishness to that of a child accusing his parents of being selfish because they refuse to buy him all the toys he wants helps put things into perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/I2aAy6-w2HU" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Glorifying God and Enjoying Him Forever&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Westminster Catechism summarizes humanity’s purpose as "to glorify God and enjoy Him forever." By submitting to and glorifying God, we also benefit immeasurably and find the purpose for which we were created. It may seem more generous if God gave people happiness whether or not they wanted a relationship with Him, but C.S. Lewis explains that true happiness can only be found in a relationship with God. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Our Rebellion Against God&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By nature, we do not want to submit to God and often seek to banish Him from our lives so that we can maintain control and be gods unto ourselves. Despite our rebellion, God demonstrated His love for us by sending Jesus Christ to die for our sins. It is through God's selflessness that we are able to receive forgiveness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding whether God is selfish or not is crucial as it shapes our perception of His character and actions. Accusing God of selfishness can lead to a distorted view of who He truly is. Recognizing God's self-sufficiency and perfect being helps us realize that any attention directed towards Him is warranted. Additionally, grasping the purpose of glorifying God and enjoying Him forever enables us to find true fulfillment in life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Think About It&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reflect on your own desires and motivations. Are there areas where you may be projecting your own selfishness onto God?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consider the concept of finding true happiness in a relationship with God. How does this challenge your understanding of happiness?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In what ways can you actively submit to and glorify God in your daily life? How might this impact your overall perspective and sense of fulfillment?&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Justice is an important attribute of God that flows from His holiness. In the Bible, justice and righteousness are often used interchangeably. Righteousness encompasses both God's justice and holiness, as it represents being right or just. Sin, on the other hand, is everything contrary to God's holy nature and is offensive to Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We cannot fully grasp the concept of God's justice without understanding sin. Sin is described as lawlessness and iniquity. It is a crime against God, and justice demands a penalty for it. According to the Bible, this penalty is death and separation from God. However, God, in His great love for humanity, sent His Son Jesus Christ to pay the penalty for our sins. Through Jesus' sacrifice on the cross, salvation became available to all who believe in Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God's righteousness is offered as a gift to sinners who accept Jesus Christ as their Savior. This righteousness is based on God's grace and mercy, which are not in spite of His justice but because of it. Despite our sin deserving death, God's justice was satisfied through Jesus' substitutionary sacrifice on the cross.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As humans created in God's image, we have an inherent longing for moral justice on earth. We are outraged when we witness injustice around us because it goes against our DNA. The story of King David and Nathan reveals this innate desire for justice. David's repentance after realizing his sin against God demonstrated his acknowledgment of God's righteousness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking ahead to the future, the book of Revelation depicts the ultimate display of God's justice during the end times. The destruction of the earth serves as a demonstration of God's righteous judgment upon those who rejected Him. The saints rejoice in the justice of God, knowing that He will ultimately make all things right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4_SSTLT3iX0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding God as the God of justice helps us make sense of the world we live in. It gives us hope that one day, all injustices will be remedied and God's righteousness will prevail. It also reminds us of the seriousness of sin and the need for salvation through Jesus Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recognizing God's justice also instills in us a sense of responsibility to seek justice in our own lives. As we reflect God's character, we should strive to treat others justly and fight against injustice in all its forms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In what ways can you seek justice in your everyday life?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does understanding God as the God of justice impact your view of sin and salvation?&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question of how many gods exist is a complex one that varies depending on different religious beliefs. In this article, we will explore the perspectives of various religions and worldviews, with a focus on the monotheistic view upheld by Christianity, Judaism, and Islam. We will also examine polytheism, atheism, and pantheism to provide a comprehensive understanding of different perspectives on the divine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Monotheism: One God&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monotheistic religions such as Christianity, Judaism, and Islam firmly believe in the existence of only one true God. These religions teach that God is the creator and sustainer of all things and transcends the entire universe. According to the Bible, there is only one God who is eternal, all-powerful, and sovereign over all creation. This monotheistic perspective rejects the idea that any other entities can be considered gods or challenge the power of the one true God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Polytheism: Many Gods&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polytheistic religions allow for the belief in multiple gods. Polytheism takes various forms, with some considering all gods to be relatively equal and others establishing a hierarchy among them. Hinduism, for example, teaches the existence of millions of gods. Other polytheistic belief systems include some forms of Buddhism, Taoism, Shintoism, Paganism, and Mormonism (although Mormons argue that they worship only one God).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Atheism: No Gods&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Atheism is a worldview that rejects the existence of any gods or supernatural beings. Atheists do not believe in a personal divine being who created or governs the universe. From an atheist's perspective, there is no evidence or reason to support the existence of a god or any form of divine power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9sI3F9TV750" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Pantheism: All is God&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pantheism is a worldview that holds that God is present in and permeates all things. Many Hindus, Buddhists, and New Age religions adhere to pantheistic beliefs. According to pantheism, God is infinite and encompasses everything in the world. In this view, everything is associated with God, and there is no distinction between God and the world. Pantheism does not attribute personal characteristics to God, but rather sees God as an all-encompassing force.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Christian Perspective&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christianity upholds a unique perspective on the nature of God. It affirms the existence of one God while revealing that God exists in three co-existent, co-eternal, and co-equal persons known as the Trinity. The Trinity consists of God the Father, God the Son (Jesus Christ), and God the Holy Spirit. This understanding of God's nature sets Christianity apart from other monotheistic religions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding different perspectives on the existence of gods helps us engage with people from diverse religious backgrounds. It allows us to respect their beliefs while also articulating our own faith. Furthermore, exploring these ideas encourages us to deepen our understanding of our own faith and develop a coherent worldview.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider how your own beliefs about God align with the perspectives discussed in this article. Reflect on how understanding different viewpoints can inform your interactions with people of other faiths or worldviews.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/The Nature of God/Singularity"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>7 Proven Benefits of Embracing Monotheism in Christianity</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/monotheism/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-08-07T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-08-07T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-08-07:/monotheism/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Monotheism&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monotheism is the belief in one true God who is the only creator, sustainer, and judge of all creation. It differs from henotheism, which believes in multiple gods with one supreme God over all, and polytheism, which is the belief in the existence of more than one god.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The …&lt;/h3&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Monotheism&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monotheism is the belief in one true God who is the only creator, sustainer, and judge of all creation. It differs from henotheism, which believes in multiple gods with one supreme God over all, and polytheism, which is the belief in the existence of more than one god.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Biblical Basis for Monotheism&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bible provides several verses that support monotheism. In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Deuteronomy/4/Deuteronomy-4-35.html"&gt;Deuteronomy 4:35&lt;/a&gt;, it is stated that "You were shown these things so that you might know that the LORD is God; besides Him there is no other." &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Deuteronomy/6/Deuteronomy-6-4.html"&gt;Deuteronomy 6:4&lt;/a&gt; says, "Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God, the LORD is one." Other verses such as Malachi 2:10a, &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-Corinthians/8/1-Corinthians-8-6.html"&gt;1 Corinthians 8:6&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Ephesians/4/Ephesians-4-6.html"&gt;Ephesians 4:6&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-Timothy/2/1-Timothy-2-5.html"&gt;1 Timothy 2:5&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/James/2/James-2-19.html"&gt;James 2:19&lt;/a&gt; also emphasize the belief in one God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While these biblical references may not be convincing for those who do not believe in the authority of the Bible, they serve as a starting point for those who are familiar with its teachings. Moreover, the supernatural evidence presented in Scripture and the life and resurrection of Jesus Christ can provide additional support for monotheism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Historical Anthropology and Monotheism&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study of historical anthropology reveals an interesting trend in religious development. Contrary to the popular evolutionary theory that suggests religions have evolved from monotheism to polytheism, many cultures actually show vestiges of monotheism early in their development. This suggests that most religions have begun with a belief in one God before devolving into polytheism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8KrWSvZkkQ4" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even within polytheistic religions, there is often a central god who is considered sovereign over the rest. This functional monotheism or henotheism further supports the idea that monotheism is deeply ingrained in human religious beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Philosophical Arguments for Monotheism&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several philosophical arguments that support the belief in one God. One such argument is based on the idea that if there were more than one God, the universe would be in disorder due to multiple creators and authorities. However, since the universe is not in disorder, it follows that there is only one God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another argument stems from the concept of God being a completely perfect being. If there were a second God, they would have to differ in some way, which would mean they are less than perfect and not truly God. Therefore, there can only be one completely perfect being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the infinite existence of God poses a challenge to the existence of multiple gods. If God's existence is infinite and cannot be divided into parts, it follows that there cannot be two infinite beings. Therefore, there can only be one infinite God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding monotheism is important because it forms the foundation of many religious beliefs and practices. It provides a framework for understanding the nature of God and our relationship with Him. Monotheism also highlights the uniqueness and supremacy of God, emphasizing His role as the creator and sustainer of all things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think About It&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider how monotheism shapes your understanding of God and your relationship with Him. How does the belief in one true God impact your daily life and decisions? Reflect on how monotheism sets Christianity apart from other religions that may embrace polytheism or henotheism.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/The Nature of God/Singularity"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Praise the Lord: Your Guide to Ultimate Worship and Devotion</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/praise-the-lord/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-08-07T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-08-07T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-08-07:/praise-the-lord/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Praise the Lord: Understanding the Meaning and Importance&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Praising the Lord is an essential part of worshiping God. It is an act of expressing adoration, approval, and gratitude towards Him for His traits, works, and character. In the Bible, there are multiple words in Hebrew and Greek translated as "praise," but they all convey the same fundamental idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What does it mean to praise the Lord?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To praise the Lord is to acknowledge and honor Him for who He is and what He has done. It involves acts of blessing, commending, honoring, thanking, celebrating, and rejoicing. We praise the Lord because He is worthy of all our praise. His love, faithfulness, mercy, justice, and promises make Him deserving of our adoration and approval.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Elements of Praise&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When King David brought the ark of the covenant back to Jerusalem, he appointed Levites to minister before the Lord, extol Him, thank Him, and praise Him. Their role was to proclaim His name, make known His deeds, remember His wonders and miracles, and declare His glory among the nations. David instructed them to sing praises to the Lord and worship Him in the splendor of His holiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/f2oxGYpuLkw" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This passage from &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-Chronicles/16/1-Chronicles-16-8.html"&gt;1 Chronicles 16:8&lt;/a&gt;–36 highlights several important aspects of praising God:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Making God known: Praising God helps spread knowledge of His greatness among the nations. It involves extolling His goodness and declaring His marvelous deeds to others.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remembering God's works: Praising the Lord includes recalling His wonders, miracles, judgments, faithfulness, and promises. It acknowledges that He remembers His covenant forever.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Proclaiming salvation: Praise involves declaring God's salvation day after day and acknowledging that He is the only one who can save us.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Universal praise: All people are called upon to praise the Lord because He is great and worthy of praise. Even nature itself is invited to join in proclaiming His reign.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Continual praise: Praising the Lord is not a one-time event but an ongoing act of worship that should be practiced continually.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Praise in Worship&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Praise is a central aspect of worshiping God. King David set aside a division of the Levites to praise the Lord with musical instruments in the future temple. During the rebuilding of the temple, when the foundation was laid, the priests and Levites praised the Lord with trumpets and cymbals, singing, "He is good; his love toward Israel endures forever." The people responded with a great shout of praise because they recognized the significance of this milestone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Reasons for Praise&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Ephesians 1, the apostle Paul gives us many reasons to praise the Lord. These include God's blessings in the heavenly realms, His election, sanctification, adoption, glorious grace, redemption through Christ's blood, forgiveness, wisdom, understanding, and His plan for the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When our lives are filled with the righteousness of Christ, it brings glory and praise to God. Paul prayed for the Philippians that their love would abound more and more so that they may be pure and blameless, filled with the fruit of righteousness. James warns against praising God while cursing others, emphasizing that our actions and words should align with God's character if we genuinely want to praise Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How and When to Praise&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can praise the Lord in various ways: through singing, dancing, playing musical instruments, using our words, displaying uprightness in our actions, and praising Him with all our hearts. The Bible encourages us to praise God at all times because He is worthy of our adoration and approval.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the meaning and importance of praising the Lord helps us develop a deeper relationship with Him. It allows us to express our love, gratitude, and reverence for His character and works. Praising God also helps us make Him known to others, as we proclaim His greatness and acknowledge His salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can you incorporate more praise into your daily life and worship?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What aspects of God's character or works are you particularly grateful for and want to praise Him for?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can praising God impact your perspective on life and your relationship with Him?&lt;/li&gt;

Understanding Divine Healing</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/god-allow-sickness/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-08-06T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-08-06T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-08-06:/god-allow-sickness/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;God's Purpose in Allowing Sickness&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we experience sickness or suffering, it can be challenging to understand why God allows it. However, as Christians, we believe that God's ways are higher than our ways (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/55/Isaiah-55-9.html"&gt;Isaiah 55:9&lt;/a&gt;) and that He can bring about good from any situation (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/8/Romans-8-28.html"&gt;Romans 8:28 …&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;God's Purpose in Allowing Sickness&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we experience sickness or suffering, it can be challenging to understand why God allows it. However, as Christians, we believe that God's ways are higher than our ways (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/55/Isaiah-55-9.html"&gt;Isaiah 55:9&lt;/a&gt;) and that He can bring about good from any situation (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/8/Romans-8-28.html"&gt;Romans 8:28&lt;/a&gt;). While sickness is not always directly from God, He sometimes allows or even causes it to accomplish His sovereign purposes. It is important to remember that even in times of sickness, God is still in control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Sickness in a Fallen World&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a world tainted by sin, sickness, disease, and death will always be present. As fallen beings with physical bodies prone to disease and illness, we are susceptible to sickness as a result of the natural course of things in this world. Some sickness may also be the result of a demonic attack, as described in the Bible (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/17/Matthew-17-14.html"&gt;Matthew 17:14-18&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/13/Luke-13-10.html"&gt;Luke 13:10-16&lt;/a&gt;). Even in these instances, God remains in control and can still use sickness according to His perfect will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Sickness as Discipline and Spiritual Growth&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/12/Hebrews-12-5.html"&gt;Hebrews 12:5-11&lt;/a&gt; describes how God disciplines us to produce a harvest of righteousness. While sickness is not directly addressed in this passage, it teaches us that discipline can be a means through which God works for our spiritual growth. It may be difficult for us to comprehend why God would use sickness in this manner, but as believers in His sovereignty, we understand that suffering is something He allows and/or causes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The psalmist in Psalm 119 provides us with an example of looking at suffering from God's perspective. As the psalmist reflects on his own afflictions, he acknowledges that it was good for him to be afflicted so that he might learn God's decrees and obey His Word. The psalmist recognizes that it was through his suffering that God's faithfulness was revealed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;God's Sovereignty in Sickness&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding and accepting God's sovereignty in sickness can be a challenging concept. While we may not fully grasp why God allows sickness, we can trust that He is working all things for our ultimate good and His glory. Even the ultimate suffering—death—can be seen as an act of God's goodness, as it grants believers eternal life in heaven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Ministering to Those Suffering&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MGMRuIVGSNc" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When people are suffering, it is important for us as Christians to minister to them, care for them, pray for them, and offer comfort. In the midst of suffering, it may not always be appropriate to emphasize the idea that God will bring good out of the suffering. While this truth is valid, those who are suffering need our love and encouragement more than theological reminders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding why God allows sickness is crucial in our walk of faith. It helps us navigate the challenges and uncertainties that come with illness and suffering. Recognizing that sickness can serve a purpose in God's greater plan can bring comfort and hope during difficult times. It also reminds us of our need to trust in God's sovereignty and lean on Him for strength and guidance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Think About It&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does knowing that sickness is a result of living in a fallen world affect your perspective on illness?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reflect on a time when you or someone you know experienced sickness or suffering. In what ways did it lead to spiritual growth or draw you closer to God?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can you minister to those who are suffering without overwhelming them with theological explanations?&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Understanding God's will can be complex, but it can be broken down into three aspects: His sovereign will, His revealed will, and His dispositional will. Each aspect provides insights into how God's will operates in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1. God's Sovereign Will&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God's sovereign will, also known as His …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;God's Will&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding God's will can be complex, but it can be broken down into three aspects: His sovereign will, His revealed will, and His dispositional will. Each aspect provides insights into how God's will operates in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1. God's Sovereign Will&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God's sovereign will, also known as His hidden will, reveals His role as the ruler of the universe who ordains all that happens. It encompasses God's decrees and is often unknown to us until it unfolds. Nothing occurs outside of God's sovereign will. For example, Joseph being taken to Egypt, imprisoned, and eventually becoming a savior to his people was part of God's sovereign will (Genesis 37–50). This aspect of God's will can be further divided into two categories: His efficacious will and His permissive will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God's efficacious will directly contributes to the fulfillment of His desires, while His permissive will allows for an indirect fulfillment of His desires. Although God permits events and happenings, it does not mean He directly causes everything to happen. An example of God's permissive will is seen in the story of Joseph and his brothers. God allowed Joseph to be kidnapped and enslaved by his brothers, which was a sinful act. However, God used this situation for a greater purpose (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/50/Genesis-50-20.html"&gt;Genesis 50:20&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Understanding God's sovereign will helps us recognize that nothing happens outside of His control. Even when we face difficult circumstances or encounter evil, we can trust that God is still at work according to His purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; How does knowing that God is in control of all things impact your trust in Him during challenging times?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2. God's Revealed Will&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1zo3fJYtS-o" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;God's revealed will refers to what He has made known to us through the Bible. It includes His precepts or commands that guide our actions and behavior. God's revealed will is not hidden from us but is plainly stated in Scripture. For example, &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Micah/6/Micah-6-8.html"&gt;Micah 6:8&lt;/a&gt; tells us that God requires us to act justly, love mercy, and walk humbly with Him. We also know that God's revealed will includes commands such as speaking the truth in love (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Ephesians/4/Ephesians-4-15.html"&gt;Ephesians 4:15&lt;/a&gt;), repenting and turning to God (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Acts/3/Acts-3-19.html"&gt;Acts 3:19&lt;/a&gt;), avoiding adultery (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-Corinthians/6/1-Corinthians-6-18.html"&gt;1 Corinthians 6:18&lt;/a&gt;), and refraining from drunkenness (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Ephesians/5/Ephesians-5-18.html"&gt;Ephesians 5:18&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; God's revealed will provides us with guidance for living a life that pleases Him. It helps us understand what is right and wrong according to His standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; How does following God's revealed will impact your relationships with others and your personal character?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;3. God's Dispositional Will&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God's dispositional will refers to His attitude or desires. It reveals what pleases or displeases Him. For example, &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-Timothy/2/1-Timothy-2-4.html"&gt;1 Timothy 2:4&lt;/a&gt; states that God wants all people to be saved and come to a knowledge of the truth. This expresses His disposition towards the lost; He desires their salvation. However, while God's heart desires all to be saved, not all choose to accept His offer of salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Recognizing God's dispositional will helps us understand His heart for humanity. It reminds us of His desire for people to experience His love and salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; How does understanding God's dispositional will impact your view of His love for humanity and your role in sharing the Gospel?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding God's will involves recognizing these three aspects: His sovereign will, revealed will, and dispositional will. Each aspect provides valuable insights into how God works in the world and our lives. While these concepts may seem complex at first, breaking them down into simpler terms allows us to grasp the depth of God's will and its significance for our faith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary, God's sovereign will showcases His control over all things, His revealed will guides our actions and behavior, and His dispositional will reveals His desires and attitude towards humanity. Embracing these aspects of God's will leads us to a deeper understanding of His character and purpose for our lives.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/Our Response to God/Knowing God"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Is God Fair?

&lt;p&gt;When discussing whether God is fair, it is important to understand what fairness means. Fairness can be defined as everyone receiving exactly what they deserve. If we were to receive what we truly deserve, we would all end up in hell paying for our sins. The Bible tells us that all have sinned against God and are worthy of eternal death (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/3/Romans-3-23.html"&gt;Romans 3:23&lt;/a&gt;, 6:23). However, God is merciful and good, so He sent Jesus Christ to die on the cross in our place, taking the punishment that we deserve (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/2-Corinthians/5/2-Corinthians-5-21.html"&gt;2 Corinthians 5:21&lt;/a&gt;). By believing in Christ, we can be saved and receive an eternal home in heaven (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/3/John-3-16.html"&gt;John 3:16&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Understanding God's fairness helps us grasp the magnitude of His love and grace. It reminds us that we are all sinners in need of salvation, and it emphasizes the importance of placing our faith in Jesus Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; Consider how your understanding of God's fairness affects your view of your own sinfulness and the need for a Savior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;God's Justice and Fairness&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bible clearly states that God is just. &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Deuteronomy/32/Deuteronomy-32-4.html"&gt;Deuteronomy 32:4&lt;/a&gt; describes God as the Rock whose works are perfect and whose ways are just. He does no wrong and is upright and just. Throughout the scriptures, it is evident that God is unbiased, honest, and treats no one wrongly (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/2-Chronicles/19/2-Chronicles-19-7.html"&gt;2 Chronicles 19:7&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/9/Romans-9-14.html"&gt;Romans 9:14&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/2-Thessalonians/1/2-Thessalonians-1-6.html"&gt;2 Thessalonians 1:6&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Acts/10/Acts-10-34.html"&gt;Acts 10:34-35&lt;/a&gt; emphasizes that God does not show favoritism but accepts from every nation those who fear Him and do what is right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Recognizing God's justice assures us that He will always do what is right and fair. It helps us trust His judgment and rely on His righteousness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; Reflect on a time when you experienced unfair treatment. How does understanding God's justice and fairness provide comfort and assurance?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;God's Sovereignty and Election&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept of election is often seen as unfair, as it appears to contradict the idea of everyone being treated equally. However, the Bible teaches that God chose certain individuals to be conformed to the likeness of His Son, called, justified, and glorified (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/8/Romans-8-29.html"&gt;Romans 8:29-30&lt;/a&gt;). Various scriptures mention believers in Christ being chosen (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/24/Matthew-24-22.html"&gt;Matthew 24:22&lt;/a&gt;, 31; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/13/Mark-13-20.html"&gt;Mark 13:20&lt;/a&gt;, 27; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/8/Romans-8-33.html"&gt;Romans 8:33&lt;/a&gt;, 9:11, 11:5-7, 28; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Ephesians/1/Ephesians-1-11.html"&gt;Ephesians 1:11&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Colossians/3/Colossians-3-12.html"&gt;Colossians 3:12&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-Thessalonians/1/1-Thessalonians-1-4.html"&gt;1 Thessalonians 1:4&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-Timothy/5/1-Timothy-5-21.html"&gt;1 Timothy 5:21&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/2-Timothy/2/2-Timothy-2-10.html"&gt;2 Timothy 2:10&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Titus/1/Titus-1-1.html"&gt;Titus 1:1&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-Peter/1/1-Peter-1-1.html"&gt;1 Peter 1:1-2&lt;/a&gt;, 2:9; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/2-Peter/1/2-Peter-1-10.html"&gt;2 Peter 1:10&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Understanding God's sovereignty and election reminds us that salvation is ultimately in His hands. It emphasizes the grace and mercy we receive when we are chosen by Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; Consider how the concept of election affects your perception of God's love for you. How does it impact your understanding of your own faith journey?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Responsibility of Belief&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While God has chosen some for salvation, it is essential to recognize that belief in Jesus Christ is necessary for salvation (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/3/John-3-16.html"&gt;John 3:16&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/10/Romans-10-9.html"&gt;Romans 10:9-10&lt;/a&gt;). The Bible never describes God rejecting anyone who believes in Him or turning away anyone who seeks Him (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Deuteronomy/4/Deuteronomy-4-29.html"&gt;Deuteronomy 4:29&lt;/a&gt;). We have a responsibility to respond to what God has revealed about Himself. &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/1/Romans-1-26.html"&gt;Romans 1:26&lt;/a&gt; tells us that since the creation of the world, God's invisible qualities have been clearly seen and understood, leaving people without excuse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Acknowledging our responsibility to believe in God helps us understand the importance of a personal relationship with Him. It highlights the significance of seeking Him and responding to His revelation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; Reflect on your own faith journey. How did your personal response to God's revelation play a role in your belief in Him?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/E-7ZChca4KE" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Consequences of Rejecting God&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those who refuse to believe in God, they will receive what they truly deserve because of their rejection of Him. Scripture tells us that their punishment is fair (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/3/John-3-18.html"&gt;John 3:18&lt;/a&gt;, 36). While it may seem unfair from a human perspective, those who reject God receive the consequences they desire. On the other hand, those whom God has chosen are receiving His love and grace, far better than they deserve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Recognizing the consequences of rejecting God reminds us of the urgency to share the message of salvation with others. It underscores the importance of making a choice to follow Him and the eternal ramifications of that decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; Consider how understanding the consequences of rejecting God impacts your motivation to share the Gospel with others. How does it shape your perspective on evangelism?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;God's Fairness and Grace&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, God's fairness is demonstrated through His grace, mercy, and forgiveness. He offers salvation to all who believe in Jesus Christ (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/3/John-3-16.html"&gt;John 3:16&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/10/Romans-10-9.html"&gt;Romans 10:9-10&lt;/a&gt;). No one is being punished beyond what they deserve, as those who reject God receive what they desire. However, those who believe in Him receive far better than they deserve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Understanding God's fairness and grace helps us appreciate the depth of His love for humanity. It encourages us to share His message of salvation with others and live lives that reflect His grace and mercy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; Reflect on the grace and mercy you have received from God. How does it inspire you to extend grace and mercy to others?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, God is fair in His treatment of humanity. He offers salvation to all who believe in Jesus Christ, even though we all deserve punishment for our sins. While the concept of election may seem unfair, it is ultimately in God's hands, and we have a responsibility to respond to His revelation. Those who reject God receive what they desire, while those who believe in Him receive His grace and mercy. Understanding God's fairness and grace deepens our appreciation for His love and motivates us to share His message with others.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/The Character of God/Justice"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Unlocking the Infinite Majesty of God: A Christian''s Guide to Understanding His Limitless Nature</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/infinite-god/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-08-04T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-08-04T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-08-04:/infinite-god/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;The Infinite Nature of God&lt;/h2&gt;

When we say that God is infinite, we are acknowledging that He is without limits. This concept is often associated with terms like omniscience, omnipotence, and omnipresence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Omniscience: God's Unlimited Knowledge&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One aspect of God's infinite nature is His omniscience, which means that He is all-knowing. God has unlimited knowledge and nothing takes Him by surprise. He knows everything that has happened, is happening, and will happen. Not only does God know all things that will occur in the future, but He also knows all things that could have possibly happened. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think About It: God's infinite knowledge means that He is the sovereign ruler and judge over all things. He sees and understands everything, including our thoughts and intentions. This should remind us to live in reverence and awe of Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Omnipotence: God's Unlimited Power&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God's infinite nature also includes His omnipotence, which means that He is all-powerful. His power is unlimited, and there is nothing that can stop His decreed will from happening. Nothing can thwart or stop His divine purposes from being fulfilled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think About It: God's infinite power gives us confidence in His ability to carry out His sovereign will. We can trust that He is in control and working all things together for the good of those who love Him (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/8/Romans-8-28.html"&gt;Romans 8:28&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Omnipresence: God's Ever-Present Nature&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another aspect of God's infinite nature is His omnipresence, which means that He is always present. There is no place where we can go to escape God's presence. He exists at every point in time and space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think About It: God's infinite presence assures us that we are never alone. He is with us always, guiding us and holding us in His hand. We can find comfort and security in knowing that He is near.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/x7ogV49WGco" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Transcendence: God's Exceeding Greatness&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because God is infinite, He is also said to be transcendent. This means that He is exceedingly far above creation and greater than it. God is independent of His creation, and He surpasses our ability to fully comprehend Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think About It: Our finite minds cannot fully grasp the greatness of God. However, He has revealed Himself to us through creation, our conscience, the Bible, and Jesus Christ. Through His revelation, we can know God and understand His will for our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters: Understanding God's Infinite Nature&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding and embracing the infinite nature of God is vital for our faith and relationship with Him. It reminds us of His sovereignty, power, and presence. It encourages us to trust in His plans and purposes. It also humbles us, acknowledging that we are finite beings in need of a limitless God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It: Our Infinite God&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we reflect on the infinite nature of God, let us marvel at His greatness and embrace His revelation. Let us seek to know Him more deeply and to live in awe of His majesty. May we find comfort and peace in His omnipresence and trust in His unlimited power. And may we live our lives in a way that honors and glorifies our infinite God.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/The Nature of God/Time and Place"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Unveiling the Sacred Mystery of the Ontological Trinity: A Christian Perspective</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/ontological-trinity/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-08-03T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-08-03T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-08-03:/ontological-trinity/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Ontological Trinity: Understanding the Nature of God&lt;/h2&gt;

But …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Ontological Trinity: Understanding the Nature of God&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Christian theology, the concept of the Trinity is a fundamental belief that seeks to explain the nature of God. The term "ontological Trinity," also known as the "immanent Trinity," delves into the being or nature of each member of the Trinity. But what exactly does this mean?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Nature of Being&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To understand the ontological Trinity, we must first grasp the concept of ontology, which is the philosophical study of the nature of being. When we speak of the ontological Trinity, we are referring to the essence and attributes of each Person within the Trinity. In essence, it asserts that all three Persons – the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit – share the same divine nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Equality in Nature&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The teaching of the ontological Trinity emphasizes equality among the three Persons of God. They are equal in power, glory, wisdom, and every other aspect of their divine nature. This means that there is no hierarchy or superiority among them. While they fulfill different roles within creation and salvation (which we'll explore later), they are inherently equal in their divine attributes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Essential Unity&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ontological Trinity is also sometimes referred to as the "essential Trinity." This term highlights the essential unity and shared divine nature among the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. It emphasizes that they are not separate gods or entities but rather distinct Persons within one Godhead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-p0ir65Lhto" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The Economic Trinity&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To fully grasp the concept of the ontological Trinity, it is helpful to contrast it with another theological term: the economic Trinity. While the ontological Trinity focuses on who God is, the economic Trinity centers on what God does. The economic Trinity explores the relationships within the Godhead and each Person's role in creation and salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Biblical Basis&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept of an ontological Trinity finds support in various biblical passages. For instance, &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/10/John-10-30.html"&gt;John 10:30&lt;/a&gt; states that Jesus and the Father are one. This oneness refers to their shared nature, highlighting their ontological unity. Additionally, in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/28/Matthew-28-19.html"&gt;Matthew 28:19&lt;/a&gt;, Jesus instructs us to baptize "in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit." This statement equates the three Persons of the Godhead, affirming their ontological equality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the ontological Trinity is crucial for Christians as it forms the foundation of our belief system. It shapes our understanding of who God is – a triune being with three distinct Persons who are equal in nature. Recognizing this truth helps us develop a deeper appreciation for the complexity and unity of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider how the concept of the ontological Trinity impacts your view of God. How does it shape your understanding of His attributes and relationships within the Godhead? Reflect on how this belief influences your relationship with each Person of the Trinity and your understanding of their roles in creation and salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Symbol for the Trinity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept of the Trinity is complex, and finding a symbol that accurately represents it can be challenging. However, one commonly used symbol is a diagram consisting of three interlocking circles. Each circle represents one Person of the Trinity: the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. The overlapping area symbolizes their essential unity as one Godhead, while the distinct circles represent their individuality as distinct Persons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Trinity Symbol" src="https://example.com/trinity-symbol.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this symbol can help us visualize the Trinity, it is important to remember that no single representation can fully capture the depth and mystery of this theological concept.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ontological Trinity is a fundamental doctrine in Christianity that explores the nature of God. It emphasizes that each Person within the Trinity shares the same divine nature and is equal in power, glory, wisdom, and all other attributes. This concept is essential to our understanding of God's unity and informs our relationship with each Person of the Trinity. As we reflect on the ontological Trinity, let us marvel at the complexity and beauty of our triune God.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/The Nature of God/The Trinity"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Unveiling the Power of God''s Outstretched Arm: A Divine Revelation for Believers</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/god-outstretched-arm/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-08-02T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-08-02T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-08-02:/god-outstretched-arm/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;God's Outstretched Arm&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The phrase "God's outstretched arm" is mentioned several times in the Old Testament, specifically in reference to God's sovereign involvement in the world and His displays of power. This concept is often connected with phrases such as "mighty hand," "great judgments," "signs and wonders," and "war." By examining these references, we can gain a deeper understanding of God's outstretched arm and its significance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Exodus and Deliverance&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the earliest instances of God's outstretched arm is found in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Exodus/6/Exodus-6-6.html"&gt;Exodus 6:6&lt;/a&gt;, where God promises Moses that He will deliver the Israelites from Egypt with an outstretched arm and great judgments. This theme of deliverance is further emphasized by Moses himself in Deuteronomy, as he reminds the people that God led them out of Egypt with signs, wonders, war, a mighty hand, and an outstretched arm (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Deuteronomy/4/Deuteronomy-4-34.html"&gt;Deuteronomy 4:34&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;God's Mighty Hand and Outstretched Arm&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moses continues to reinforce the idea of God's mighty hand and outstretched arm throughout his writings. In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Deuteronomy/5/Deuteronomy-5-15.html"&gt;Deuteronomy 5:15&lt;/a&gt;, he once again highlights how God brought Israel out of Egypt with His great power and outstretched arm. Moses challenges the people to recognize and remember God's greatness, His mighty hand, and His outstretched arm (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Deuteronomy/11/Deuteronomy-11-2.html"&gt;Deuteronomy 11:2&lt;/a&gt;). In his final reference to God's outstretched arm, Moses recounts how God brought Israel out of Egypt with a mighty hand, an outstretched arm, terrors, signs, and wonders (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Deuteronomy/26/Deuteronomy-26-8.html"&gt;Deuteronomy 26:8&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Solomon's Dedication of the Temple&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Solomon dedicated the temple, he also spoke of God's great name, mighty hand, and outstretched arm (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-Kings/8/1-Kings-8-42.html"&gt;1 Kings 8:42&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/2-Chronicles/6/2-Chronicles-6-32.html"&gt;2 Chronicles 6:32&lt;/a&gt;). This connection between God's outstretched arm and His power and authority is evident throughout these passages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Psalms and Jeremiah&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The psalmists and the prophet Jeremiah also make references to God's outstretched arm. In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/136/Psalm-136-12.html"&gt;Psalm 136:12&lt;/a&gt;, a psalmist recounts how God brought Israel out of Egypt with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm, emphasizing God's everlasting lovingkindness. Jeremiah records multiple allusions to God's outstretched arm, including warnings of war against the nation due to their sin (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Jeremiah/21/Jeremiah-21-5.html"&gt;Jeremiah 21:5&lt;/a&gt;) and reminders of God's creation and His ability to accomplish great things (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Jeremiah/27/Jeremiah-27-5.html"&gt;Jeremiah 27:5&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Jeremiah/32/Jeremiah-32-17.html"&gt;Jeremiah 32:17&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/P63SUjthD0Y" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Ezekiel's Prophecies&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Ezekiel, God promises to rule with a mighty hand, an outstretched arm, and with poured-out wrath (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Ezekiel/20/Ezekiel-20-33.html"&gt;Ezekiel 20:33&lt;/a&gt;–34). These prophecies speak of both judgment and restoration, as God promises to bring Israel back into the land with His mighty hand, outstretched arm, and poured-out wrath.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Understanding God's Sovereignty&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The references to God's outstretched arm in the Old Testament point to His sovereignty over the affairs of humanity, particularly in relation to Israel. They demonstrate His power, greatness, and ability to deliver His people. While these references can evoke a sense of fear and awe, they also reveal God's lovingkindness and His willingness to extend grace and restoration. It is important for us to recognize God's sovereignty, worship Him, and trust in His ability to fulfill His promises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the concept of God's outstretched arm helps us grasp the magnitude of His power and authority. It reminds us that we serve a God who is actively involved in our lives and has the ability to intervene in mighty ways. Recognizing God's sovereignty can bring comfort and assurance, knowing that He is in control and has the power to deliver us from any situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Think About It&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider the instances in your life where you have experienced God's deliverance or intervention. How does reflecting on these moments deepen your understanding of God's outstretched arm? How can you trust in His sovereignty and rely on His power in your current circumstances? Take a moment to thank God for His lovingkindness and ability to work in your life.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/The Character of God/Anthropomorphism"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Why Does God Exist: Unveiling the Divine Purpose for Christian Believers</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/why-does-god-exist/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-08-02T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-08-02T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-08-02:/why-does-god-exist/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Why Does God Exist?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the realms of logic, mathematics, and philosophy, axioms play a crucial role. Axioms are concepts that are accepted without proof or disproof. They serve as the foundation upon which these disciplines are built. For example, in mathematics, the axiom that numbers equal themselves (x …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Why Does God Exist?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the realms of logic, mathematics, and philosophy, axioms play a crucial role. Axioms are concepts that are accepted without proof or disproof. They serve as the foundation upon which these disciplines are built. For example, in mathematics, the axiom that numbers equal themselves (x = x) is accepted without question. Similarly, the law of non-contradiction states that mutually exclusive statements cannot both be true at the same time. Axioms are essential because they allow for rational thought and communication. Without them, understanding and reasoning become impossible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the context of our reality, the existence of God serves as the ultimate axiom. God simply exists because if He did not, nothing else would exist. Asking why God exists or what the reason for His existence is, is an attempt to apply cause-and-effect to a being who is beyond all causes and reasons. God's existence precedes all reasons and causes, making it illogical to ask for a reason why He exists. He must exist because without Him, there would be no reason or cause for anything else to exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Ultimate Basis of Reality&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God's nature can be understood as the Only Necessary Thing, the ultimate basis of all reality. When Moses asked God to identify Himself, God simply replied, "I AM." This statement implies His eternal existence and highlights that His nature is beyond human comprehension. Jesus also affirmed His eternal existence by using the phrase "I am." These statements underscore the fact that God's existence does not require a reason or cause – He is self-existent and self-sustaining.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_ie9musGEqQ" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Critics may argue that stating "God just exists" is evasive and not an answer. However, this response is as valid as any other axiom. In the Christian worldview, God created everything except Himself. When contemplating mathematical or logical axioms like "1 = 1" or the impossibility of square circles, we can only acknowledge that they are true without being able to provide a reason why. Similarly, for anything to exist, there must be an always-present and causeless "something" that is not the result of anything else. God's existence serves as the ultimate "why" for every aspect of reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the axiomatic nature of God's existence helps us comprehend His uniqueness and significance. It highlights that God is not subject to the same laws of cause and effect that govern our physical reality. Recognizing this truth enables us to approach God with awe and reverence, acknowledging His eternal and transcendent nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, grasping the concept of axioms allows us to appreciate the logical framework within which our reality operates. Axioms form the foundation upon which we build our understanding of mathematics, logic, and philosophy. They are essential for rational thought and communication. By recognizing that God's existence is an axiom of our reality, we gain a deeper appreciation for the logical structure of our universe and the necessity of belief in God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consider the concept of axioms in mathematics. Just like accepting axioms without questioning them, how does recognizing God's existence as an axiom impact your faith?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reflect on the statement "I AM" used by God to describe Himself. How does this highlight His eternal nature? How does it differ from human existence?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contemplate the significance of recognizing God's existence as the ultimate "why" for every aspect of reality. How does this shape your understanding of purpose and meaning in life?&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The concept of God's presence is a fundamental aspect of the Christian faith. It brings comfort, assurance, and guidance to believers.

He is with …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;God is with Us&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept of God's presence is a fundamental aspect of the Christian faith. It brings comfort, assurance, and guidance to believers. The Bible teaches us that God is not a distant and detached deity, but rather He is intimately involved in our lives. He is with us in every circumstance, offering His love, wisdom, and power. Understanding this truth can have a profound impact on our relationship with God and how we navigate through life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1. God's Omnipresence&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of God's attributes is His omnipresence, which means that He is everywhere at all times. This concept can be challenging for us to fully comprehend, but it reveals the extent of God's involvement in His creation. He is universally present in person, understanding, and power. As &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Acts/17/Acts-17-27.html"&gt;Acts 17:27&lt;/a&gt; tells us, "He is not far from any one of us." This means that no matter where we are or what we are going through, God is with us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2. God's Indwelling Presence&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a more personal level, God's presence is experienced by believers through the indwelling of the Holy Spirit. This indwelling occurs when we are born again and accept Jesus Christ as our Savior. &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/3/John-3-3.html"&gt;John 3:3&lt;/a&gt; emphasizes the importance of being born again to receive the Holy Spirit. First &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/5/John-5-11.html"&gt;John 5:11-12&lt;/a&gt; further explains that eternal life is found in Jesus Christ, and whoever has Him also has life. Additionally, Jesus promised in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/14/John-14-23.html"&gt;John 14:23&lt;/a&gt; that if we love Him and obey His teachings, both He and the Father will come to make their home with us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The apostle Paul affirms this truth in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Galatians/2/Galatians-2-20.html"&gt;Galatians 2:20&lt;/a&gt;, stating that Christ lives in him. Furthermore, in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Galatians/3/Galatians-3-5.html"&gt;Galatians 3:5&lt;/a&gt;, Paul explains that believers have received the Spirit from God. This indwelling presence of God is a remarkable reality that allows us to commune with Him and experience His power, wisdom, and guidance in our daily lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9kWk_Wu-wKM" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;3. Immanuel - God with Us&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Immanuel is one of the titles given to Jesus, which means "God with us" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/1/Matthew-1-23.html"&gt;Matthew 1:23&lt;/a&gt;). When Jesus came into the world, He was truly God in human form, demonstrating God's desire to be intimately involved in humanity. This truth is significant because it assures us that we will never be separated from God's love (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/8/Romans-8-38.html"&gt;Romans 8:38-39&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus' presence in our lives enables us to accomplish God's will for us. In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-Chronicles/22/1-Chronicles-22-17.html"&gt;1 Chronicles 22:17-19&lt;/a&gt;, we see how David encouraged his son Solomon to seek God's presence and follow His instructions. This assurance of God's presence also overcomes our fears, worries, and dissatisfaction (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/13/Hebrews-13-5.html"&gt;Hebrews 13:5&lt;/a&gt;). Knowing that God is with us provides comfort and security in all circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding that God is always with us has several implications for our faith and daily lives. Firstly, it reminds us of the closeness of our relationship with God. He desires to communicate and commune with us on a personal level. This knowledge should motivate us to seek Him diligently through prayer, studying His Word, and seeking godly counsel from pastors and fellow believers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, recognizing God's presence should impact our perspective on life. Instead of relying solely on our own strength and understanding, we can lean on God's guidance and trust in His wisdom. The indwelling Holy Spirit empowers us to live a life that pleases God and bears the fruit of the Spirit (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Galatians/5/Galatians-5-22.html"&gt;Galatians 5:22-23&lt;/a&gt;). It reminds us that we are not alone; we have a constant companion who leads, comforts, and empowers us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider the significance of knowing that God is with you at all times. How does this truth impact your perspective on challenges, fears, and uncertainties? In what practical ways can you cultivate a deeper awareness of God's presence in your daily life?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The assurance that God is with us is a foundational truth in the Christian faith. It reveals His omnipresence and indwelling presence through the Holy Spirit. This understanding should shape our relationship with God and our approach to life. Knowing that God is always with us brings comfort, guidance, and empowerment. It reminds us of the closeness of our relationship with Him, encourages us to seek Him diligently, and enables us to live a life that pleases Him. May we continually cultivate an awareness of God's presence and rely on His wisdom and power in every aspect of our lives.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/God's Relationship to Us/He Cares For Us"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>The Immutable Nature of God: Unveiling His Eternal Stability</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/immutability-god/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-08-01T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-08-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-08-01:/immutability-god/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;The Immutability of God&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The immutability of God refers to His quality of not changing. It is a concept clearly taught throughout Scripture. In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Malachi/3/Malachi-3-6.html"&gt;Malachi 3:6&lt;/a&gt;, God affirms, "I the Lord do not change." This sentiment is echoed in other verses such as &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Numbers/23/Numbers-23-19.html"&gt;Numbers 23:19&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-Samuel/15/1-Samuel-15-29.html"&gt;1 Samuel 15 …&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;The Immutability of God&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The immutability of God refers to His quality of not changing. It is a concept clearly taught throughout Scripture. In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Malachi/3/Malachi-3-6.html"&gt;Malachi 3:6&lt;/a&gt;, God affirms, "I the Lord do not change." This sentiment is echoed in other verses such as &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Numbers/23/Numbers-23-19.html"&gt;Numbers 23:19&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-Samuel/15/1-Samuel-15-29.html"&gt;1 Samuel 15:29&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/46/Isaiah-46-9.html"&gt;Isaiah 46:9-11&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Ezekiel/24/Ezekiel-24-14.html"&gt;Ezekiel 24:14&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/James/1/James-1-17.html"&gt;James 1:17&lt;/a&gt; also teaches the immutability of God, stating that every good and perfect gift comes from Him and there is no variableness or shadow of turning in Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To understand the immutability of God, we can think of it in terms of the sun. The sun rises and sets, appears and disappears every day. It moves across the sky and casts its shadow. But with God, who is light itself, there is no darkness at all. There is no change with Him, nor anything like it. He is unchangeable in His nature, perfections, purposes, promises, and gifts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several logical reasons why God must be immutable. First, for change to occur, there must be a chronological order. There must be a point in time before the change and a point in time after the change. However, God exists outside of the constraints of time. He is eternal (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/33/Psalm-33-11.html"&gt;Psalm 33:11&lt;/a&gt;; 41:13; 90:2-4; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/17/John-17-5.html"&gt;John 17:5&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/2-Timothy/1/2-Timothy-1-9.html"&gt;2 Timothy 1:9&lt;/a&gt;), and therefore not subject to the limitations of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, the immutability of God is necessary for His perfection. If anything changes, it must either change for the better or the worse. But since God is perfect, He does not need anything. Therefore, He cannot change for the better or the worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thirdly, the immutability of God is related to His omniscience. When someone changes their mind, it is often because new information has come to light or the circumstances have changed. But God is omniscient and knows all things. He cannot learn something new that He did not already know. So, when the Bible speaks of God changing His mind, it is describing a change in dispensation and outward dealings toward man, not a change in God Himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pvhBX_5z0fw" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Numbers/23/Numbers-23-19.html"&gt;Numbers 23:19&lt;/a&gt; affirms the immutability of God, stating that He is not a man that He should lie or change His mind. This verse emphasizes that God does not change His mind. The doctrine of God's immutability is further affirmed throughout Scripture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the immutability of God is important for our faith and relationship with Him. It assures us that God's character and promises remain constant. We can trust in His unchanging nature and rely on His faithfulness. It also reminds us that God's love and grace are not subject to fluctuation or alteration. His love for us is steadfast and unchanging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The immutability of God also has implications for our own lives. If we serve a God who does not change, we can have confidence in His guidance and direction. We don't have to worry about God changing His mind about us or His plans for our lives. This stability and constancy provide us with security and peace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How does the immutability of God impact your understanding of His character?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In what ways does the concept of an unchanging God bring you comfort and assurance?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How does knowing that God does not change affect your trust in Him and your relationship with Him?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Bible provides us with a clear understanding of what God is like and what He is not like. Without relying on the authority of the Bible, any attempt to explain God's attributes would be no better than an opinion, which is often incorrect when it comes to understanding God. It is crucial for us to try to understand what God is like because failure to do so can lead us to set up false gods and worship them against His will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Self-Revealing Nature of God&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God has chosen to reveal knowledge of Himself through creation, the Bible, and the Word made flesh—Jesus Christ. Creation itself offers a glimpse of God's works and reveals His awesomeness through its vastness, complexity, beauty, and order. By considering these aspects of creation, we can begin to grasp the greatness of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Names of God&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reading through some of the names of God can also help us understand what He is like. Here are a few examples:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Elohim - This name refers to God as the strong One, divine.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adonai - It signifies a Lord who establishes a Master-to-servant relationship.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;El Elyon - This name emphasizes that God is the Most High, the strongest One.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;El Roi - It means that God is the strong One who sees everything.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;El Shaddai - This name highlights that God is Almighty.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;El Olam - It signifies that God is the Everlasting God.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yahweh - This name means "I AM" and represents the eternal, self-existent nature of God.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Attributes of God&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eternal and Immutable&lt;/strong&gt;: God is eternal, meaning He had no beginning and will never cease to exist. He is immortal and infinite. Furthermore, God is unchanging (immutable), making Him absolutely reliable and trustworthy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Incomparable and Perfect&lt;/strong&gt;: God is unparalleled in His works and being. He is unequaled and perfect. There is no one like Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inscrutable and Omniscient&lt;/strong&gt;: God is inscrutable, unfathomable, unsearchable, and beyond complete understanding. However, He is omniscient, meaning He knows everything—the past, present, and future—along with our thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Just and Omnipotent&lt;/strong&gt;: God is just and does not show favoritism. He is also omnipotent, possessing all power. However, His actions are always in line with His character.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Omnipresent and Sovereign&lt;/strong&gt;: God is omnipresent, meaning He is present everywhere. Yet, this does not mean that God is everything. Additionally, God is sovereign—supreme over all creation, with all of His purposes prevailing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YfeZSRnQnI8" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spirit and Truth&lt;/strong&gt;: God is spirit, invisible to human eyes. He cannot be seen with physical senses but can be experienced through faith. Moreover, God is truth itself; He cannot lie or be corrupt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Holy and Gracious&lt;/strong&gt;: God is holy, separate from all moral defilement and hostile toward evil. He sees all wrongdoings and hates them. However, He is also gracious and extends His goodness, kindness, mercy, and love to us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One and Righteous&lt;/strong&gt;: God is one; there is no other like Him who can meet the deepest needs of our hearts. He alone deserves our worship and devotion. Furthermore, God is righteous—He cannot overlook wrongdoing, which required Jesus to experience God's wrath for our sins to be forgiven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the attributes of God is crucial for our faith. It helps us develop a proper understanding of who God is and how we should relate to Him. Knowing that God is eternal, immutable, and omnipotent gives us confidence in His promises and trustworthiness. Recognizing God's justice and righteousness reminds us of the seriousness of sin and the need for forgiveness through Jesus Christ. Understanding God's holiness and grace helps us appreciate His love and mercy towards us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reflecting on the attributes of God can lead us to a deeper appreciation of His character and nature. Consider the following questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does knowing that God is eternal and unchanging impact your trust in Him?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In what ways does understanding God's justice and righteousness affect your view of sin and the need for forgiveness?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does recognizing God's holiness and grace influence your understanding of His love for you?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By pondering these questions, we can deepen our relationship with God and grow in our understanding of His attributes.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/The Nature of God/The Basics"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Discover the Unwavering Presence of God: A Guide for Christian Believers</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/god-omnipresent/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-07-30T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-07-30T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-07-30:/god-omnipresent/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;God's Omnipresence&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The concept of God's omnipresence is rooted in Latin, with the prefix "omni" meaning "all." When we say that God is omnipresent, we mean that God is present everywhere. In Christianity and Judaism, the belief in God's omnipresence is further divided into transcendence and immanence. Transcendence refers to the idea that God is not fully immersed in the fabric of creation (pantheism), but rather exists beyond it. Immanence, on the other hand, emphasizes that God is present everywhere at all times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Understanding God's omnipresence helps us develop a deeper appreciation for His immeasurable power and influence. It reminds us that we are never alone and that God is always with us, regardless of our circumstances. Recognizing His presence can provide comfort, guidance, and assurance in our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; Reflect on moments when you have felt God's presence in your life. How did it affect you? How can remembering His omnipresence impact your daily life and relationship with Him?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Continuous Presence&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God's presence is continuous throughout all of creation, although it may not be revealed in the same way at the same time to everyone. Sometimes, He may actively manifest His presence in a situation, while in other circumstances, He may not reveal Himself. The Bible teaches that God can be both manifestly present to individuals (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/46/Psalm-46-1.html"&gt;Psalm 46:1&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/57/Isaiah-57-15.html"&gt;Isaiah 57:15&lt;/a&gt;) and present in every situation within creation at any given time (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/33/Psalm-33-13.html"&gt;Psalm 33:13-14&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; Consider moments when you have recognized God's manifest presence in your life or the lives of others. How did it impact your faith or understanding of Him? Reflect on how His continuous presence in all of creation can bring hope and encouragement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Omnipresence in Time and Space&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VEfRuQpInJE" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;God's omnipresence means that He is present in all ranges of both time and space. He is not limited by any specific location or moment. God is everywhere, encompassing every now. No particle is too small for His presence, and no galaxy is too vast for Him to encompass. Even if we were to remove creation, God would still be aware of it, as He knows all possibilities, whether actualized or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Understanding God's omnipresence in time and space highlights His sovereignty and power over the universe. It reminds us that there is nowhere we can go where God is not already present, and that He is intimately aware of every aspect of our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; Reflect on how knowing that God is present in every moment and place can bring a sense of peace and security. How does this truth impact your perspective on life's challenges and uncertainties?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;God's Presence in Creation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God is naturally present in every aspect of the natural world, at all times and in all places (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/40/Isaiah-40-12.html"&gt;Isaiah 40:12&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Nahum/1/Nahum-1-3.html"&gt;Nahum 1:3&lt;/a&gt;). He is actively present in every event throughout history, guiding human affairs (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/48/Psalm-48-7.html"&gt;Psalm 48:7&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/2-Chronicles/20/2-Chronicles-20-37.html"&gt;2 Chronicles 20:37&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Daniel/5/Daniel-5-5.html"&gt;Daniel 5:5-6&lt;/a&gt;). Additionally, God is specially attentive to those who call upon His name, intercede for others, adore Him, petition Him, and earnestly seek forgiveness (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/46/Psalm-46-1.html"&gt;Psalm 46:1&lt;/a&gt;). His presence is supremely manifested in His Son, Jesus Christ (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Colossians/2/Colossians-2-19.html"&gt;Colossians 2:19&lt;/a&gt;), and mystically present in the universal Church that spans the earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Recognizing God's presence in creation helps us understand that He is actively involved in our lives and has a plan for each one of us. It also encourages us to seek a deeper relationship with Him through prayer, worship, and fellowship with other believers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; Consider how you can cultivate a greater awareness of God's presence in your daily life. How can you actively seek His guidance and depend on His strength in every situation?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Paradox of God's Presence&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as the concept of God's omniscience presents paradoxes due to our limited human understanding, so does the notion of His omnipresence. One significant paradox is the presence of God in hell, the place where the wicked are said to suffer the eternal fury of God due to their sin. Some argue that hell is a place of separation from God (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/25/Matthew-25-41.html"&gt;Matthew 25:41&lt;/a&gt;), which would suggest that God cannot be present in a place separated from Him. However, &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Revelation/14/Revelation-14-10.html"&gt;Revelation 14:10&lt;/a&gt; speaks of the torment of the wicked in the presence of the Lamb. This paradox can be explained by recognizing that God can be present even in those places separated from His blessings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; Reflect on the tension between God's presence in both heaven and hell. How does this paradox challenge your understanding of His character? Consider how it deepens your appreciation for His justice and mercy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Returning to God&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While God is present everywhere, sin can create a separation between us and Him (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/52/Isaiah-52-9.html"&gt;Isaiah 52:9&lt;/a&gt;). He is far from the wicked (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Proverbs/15/Proverbs-15-29.html"&gt;Proverbs 15:29&lt;/a&gt;) and has ordained that the godless will depart to a place of eternal punishment. Yet, even in these instances, God remains present. He knows the suffering experienced by those in hell, their anguish, cries for respite, tears, and grief over their eternal state. His perpetual presence serves as a constant reminder of their sin and the chasm it creates between them and every possible blessing. However, through repentance and faith, we can return to God without having to physically move (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/57/Isaiah-57-16.html"&gt;Isaiah 57:16&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Recognizing that God is present even in times of separation and punishment reveals His love for us and His desire for reconciliation. It reminds us that no matter how far we may have strayed, we can always turn to Him and find forgiveness and restoration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; Consider the incredible grace of God that allows us to return to Him despite our sinfulness. How does this truth impact your view of yourself and others? How does it encourage you to extend grace and forgiveness to those around you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, the concept of God's omnipresence teaches us that He is present everywhere at all times. His presence is continuous throughout creation, yet He can manifest Himself in different ways to different people. God's omnipresence extends to all ranges of time and space, emphasizing His sovereignty over the universe. He is present in nature, history, and the lives of individuals, manifesting His love, guidance, and power. Even in places of separation or punishment, God's presence remains, reminding us of His justice and mercy. Understanding God's omnipresence can deepen our faith, provide comfort in difficult times, and inspire us to seek a closer relationship with Him.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/The Nature of God/Time and Place"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>The Divine Immanence: Understanding God''s Presence in Christianity</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/immanence-of-god/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-07-30T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-07-30T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-07-30:/immanence-of-god/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;The Immanence of God&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The concept of the immanence of God refers to His presence within His creation. It is the belief that God is present in all aspects of His creation while remaining distinct from it. This should not be confused with the timing of Jesus' return to earth. The immanence of God emphasizes that there is no place where God is not present. He exercises His sovereign control over all things simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Understanding Immanence&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To better understand the immanence of God, it is important to differentiate it from other belief systems that may distort our understanding. Pantheism, for example, teaches that everything is God or a part of God. In this view, God is considered equal to His creation and unable to act upon it. Deism, on the other hand, acknowledges that God is distinct from His creation but denies His active involvement in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wL8VCCLeNvU" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Contrary to these false views, the Bible teaches that God is both different from His creation and actively upholds it. The attributes of transcendence and immanence are both ascribed to God. &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Jeremiah/23/Jeremiah-23-23.html"&gt;Jeremiah 23:23&lt;/a&gt; tells us that He is both "nearby" and "far away." &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/55/Isaiah-55-9.html"&gt;Isaiah 55:9&lt;/a&gt; states, "As the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts." This highlights God's transcendence. Additionally, &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Colossians/1/Colossians-1-17.html"&gt;Colossians 1:17&lt;/a&gt; declares that "in him all things hold together," illustrating His immanence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;God's Omnipresence&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept of God's omnipresence closely relates to His immanence. &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/139/Psalm-139-1.html"&gt;Psalm 139:1-10&lt;/a&gt; beautifully describes this attribute in detail. In the New Testament, Paul affirms that God Himself gives life and breath to all and that in Him we live, move, and have our being (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Acts/17/Acts-17-25.html"&gt;Acts 17:25&lt;/a&gt;, 28). These verses emphasize how God guides, governs, and provides for His creation while remaining above it (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Ephesians/1/Ephesians-1-11.html"&gt;Ephesians 1:11&lt;/a&gt;; 4:6).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Immanence of God in Scripture&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bible as a whole supports the idea of God's immanence. The very existence of God's Word in written form testifies to His interest and action in the world. The survival of Israel throughout biblical history and the Incarnation of Jesus are powerful examples of God's presence and involvement. &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/1/Hebrews-1-3.html"&gt;Hebrews 1:3&lt;/a&gt; affirms that God is "sustaining all things by His powerful word." Furthermore, Jesus is referred to as Immanuel, which means "God with us." This title highlights the immanence of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the immanence of God has significant implications for our faith and relationship with Him. It reminds us that God is not distant or detached from His creation but actively involved in every aspect of our lives. This understanding can bring comfort, knowing that we are never alone, and that God is intimately aware of our needs and circumstances. It also calls us to recognize and appreciate the presence of God in everyday life, leading us to worship and depend on Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reflecting on the immanence of God encourages us to consider our perspective of Him. Do we view Him as a distant deity or as an intimately involved Creator? How does our understanding of God's immanence impact our daily lives? How can we cultivate a greater awareness of His presence and seek to align ourselves with His will? Taking time to ponder these questions can deepen our faith and transform our relationship with God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, the immanence of God emphasizes His presence within His creation while remaining distinct from it. It is a concept supported by Scripture and highlights both God's transcendence and immanence. Understanding God's immanence has practical implications for our faith and calls us to recognize and appreciate His continuous presence in our lives.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/The Nature of God/Time and Place"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Discovering the Divine: Unveiling the Nature of God in Christianity</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/nature-of-god/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-07-30T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-07-30T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-07-30:/nature-of-god/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;The Nature of God&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;God's Holiness&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most important aspects of God's nature is His holiness. Holiness means being set apart, and God is clearly separate from His creation based on His nature and attributes. In the Bible, &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Revelation/15/Revelation-15-4.html"&gt;Revelation 15:4&lt;/a&gt; says, "You alone are holy," and &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Revelation/4/Revelation-4-8.html"&gt;Revelation …&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;The Nature of God&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;God's Holiness&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most important aspects of God's nature is His holiness. Holiness means being set apart, and God is clearly separate from His creation based on His nature and attributes. In the Bible, &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Revelation/15/Revelation-15-4.html"&gt;Revelation 15:4&lt;/a&gt; says, "You alone are holy," and &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Revelation/4/Revelation-4-8.html"&gt;Revelation 4:8&lt;/a&gt; describes the four living creatures singing to God day and night, "Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God Almighty." God's holiness makes Him a "consuming fire" that will judge all sin (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/12/Hebrews-12-29.html"&gt;Hebrews 12:29&lt;/a&gt;). Throughout Scripture, there are beautiful doxologies that exalt God's holiness, such as &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/99/Psalm-99-9.html"&gt;Psalm 99:9&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/33/Psalm-33-21.html"&gt;Psalm 33:21&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/77/Psalm-77-13.html"&gt;Psalm 77:13&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/89/Psalm-89-18.html"&gt;Psalm 89:18&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/105/Psalm-105-3.html"&gt;Psalm 105:3&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Understanding God's holiness helps us recognize His uniqueness and separateness from the world. It reminds us that we should approach Him with reverence and awe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; How does recognizing God's holiness impact your worship and relationship with Him?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Trinity&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God is an eternal spirit who has always existed in three distinct persons: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. He is one God (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Deuteronomy/6/Deuteronomy-6-4.html"&gt;Deuteronomy 6:4&lt;/a&gt;) but exists as three Persons. While God does not have a physical body, the Son became incarnate in Jesus Christ. Denying the Trinity or viewing God the Father as a man is a false doctrine. It is essential to affirm both the humanity and deity of Christ (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/2-John/1/2-John-1-7.html"&gt;2 John 1:7&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Understanding the Trinity teaches us about the complexity and unity within the nature of God. It also helps us understand how each person of the Trinity plays a unique role in our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; How does recognizing the Trinity affect your understanding of salvation?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;God's Sovereignty&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God, by nature, is sovereign. He has absolute authority over the entire universe and everything in it. His sovereignty is expressed in many ways, including His omnipotence. All of God's ways are right (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/145/Psalm-145-17.html"&gt;Psalm 145:17&lt;/a&gt;), and He is not constrained by time or place. He has a plan that has been in place from eternity past, and His purpose will be accomplished (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Daniel/4/Daniel-4-37.html"&gt;Daniel 4:37&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/115/Psalm-115-3.html"&gt;Psalm 115:3&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QPywCD-TSd0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Recognizing God's sovereignty helps us trust in His plans and purposes even when we don't understand them. It reminds us that God is ultimately in control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; How does understanding God's sovereignty impact your faith and trust in Him?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;God's Immutability&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God does not change; He is the same "yesterday, today, and forever" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/13/Hebrews-13-8.html"&gt;Hebrews 13:8&lt;/a&gt;). He explicitly states in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Malachi/3/Malachi-3-6.html"&gt;Malachi 3:6&lt;/a&gt;, "I the LORD do not change." Because of His unchanging nature, we can depend on His blessings. &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/James/1/James-1-17.html"&gt;James 1:17&lt;/a&gt; says, "Every good and perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of the heavenly lights, who does not change like shifting shadows."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Understanding God's immutability reassures us that His character and promises remain steadfast. We can rely on Him to be consistent in His love, mercy, and faithfulness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; How does knowing that God does not change impact your relationship with Him?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;God's Omniscience&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God knows everything from eternity past to eternity future. He knows everything we think, do, and say. He has personal knowledge of every person who has ever lived or will live, knowing them intimately in every way. &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Jeremiah/1/Jeremiah-1-5.html"&gt;Jeremiah 1:5&lt;/a&gt; says, "Before I formed you in the womb I knew you, before you were born, I set you apart."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Recognizing God's omniscience brings comfort and assurance. It reminds us that we are known and loved by a God who understands us completely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; How does the knowledge that God knows everything impact your prayer life and sense of security?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;God's Love and Wrath&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God's nature encompasses both love and wrath. He has a righteous anger against sin (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/7/Psalm-7-11.html"&gt;Psalm 7:11&lt;/a&gt;). However, out of His love for the world, He sent His only Son, Jesus Christ, to redeem us (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/3/John-3-16.html"&gt;John 3:16&lt;/a&gt;). God is not only loving but is love itself (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-John/4/1-John-4-16.html"&gt;1 John 4:16&lt;/a&gt;). His love is eternal, unchanging, perfect, and holy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Understanding God's love and wrath helps us grasp the depth of His character and the significance of our salvation through Jesus Christ. It also highlights the importance of sharing the gospel message with others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; How does knowing God's love and wrath impact your understanding of salvation and your relationship with others?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nature of God is multifaceted and complex. He is holy, separate from His creation. He exists as three distinct persons in the Trinity while being one God. God is sovereign, immutable, omniscient, loving, and just. Understanding these aspects of God's nature deepens our faith, shapes our worship, and strengthens our relationship with Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Our understanding of God's nature shapes our theology and informs how we live out our faith daily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The concept of mocking God refers to disrespecting, dishonoring, or ignoring Him. It is a serious offense committed by those who have no fear of God or deny His existence.

&lt;p&gt;The concept of mocking God refers to disrespecting, dishonoring, or ignoring Him. It is a serious offense committed by those who have no fear of God or deny His existence. Mockery can take various forms, such as verbal insults or acts of disdain, and it is associated with ridicule, scoffing, and defiance. In the Bible, mockery is often depicted as a behavior and attitude shown by fools, the wicked, enemies of God, haters of knowledge, the proud, and the unteachable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When individuals mock God, they often also mock His people. Throughout history, prophets like Jeremiah were ridiculed and mocked by their own people. Nehemiah faced mockery from his enemies, and even Jesus Himself was mocked by various individuals and groups during His crucifixion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, it is essential to recognize that mockery of God is not limited to those outside the church. Sometimes, even believers engage in a form of mockery when they display outward spirituality without genuine inward transformation. This kind of hypocrisy grieves the Holy Spirit and can lead to a hardening of the heart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God warns that those who mock what is holy will face punishment. The prophet Zephaniah predicted the downfall of Moab and Ammon because of their pride and their mockery of God's people. In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/28/Isaiah-28-22.html"&gt;Isaiah 28:22&lt;/a&gt;, mockery is seen as causing the chains of sin to become stronger and leading to destruction. &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Proverbs/3/Proverbs-3-34.html"&gt;Proverbs 3:34&lt;/a&gt; states that God will mock those who mock Him but give favor to the humble and oppressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8f3tPpRztLk" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The principle that "God cannot be mocked" is emphasized in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Galatians/6/Galatians-6-7.html"&gt;Galatians 6:7&lt;/a&gt;, which states that individuals will reap what they sow. This means that there are consequences for ignoring God's directives and willfully choosing sin. Examples from the Bible, such as Adam and Eve's disobedience and Ananias and Sapphira's deception, demonstrate the swift and public judgment that can come from mocking God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to understand that God cannot be deceived. &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/4/Hebrews-4-12.html"&gt;Hebrews 4:12-13&lt;/a&gt; reminds us that God sees and knows everything, and we only deceive ourselves when we think our attitudes and actions are hidden from Him. The Bible provides guidance on how to live a blessed life, highlighting the importance of avoiding the path of the wicked and instead delighting in the law of the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the concept of mocking God is crucial for believers because it serves as a reminder of the seriousness of our actions and attitudes. It encourages us to examine our hearts and ensure that our outward expressions of faith align with genuine inner transformation. By avoiding mockery and living in obedience to God, we can experience His blessings and avoid the negative consequences that come from mocking Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you ever witnessed or engaged in mocking God or His people? Reflect on how you can strive to live in genuine obedience and avoid hypocrisy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How does knowing that God sees and knows everything impact your daily life? How does it influence the choices you make?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take some time to meditate on &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/1/Psalm-1-1.html"&gt;Psalm 1:1-3&lt;/a&gt;. Consider how delighting in God's law can lead to a blessed life and fruitful outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question of whether God knew that Satan would rebel is an important one. According to the Bible, God is described as being omniscient, meaning that He is all-knowing. This concept is supported by various passages in Scripture such as &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Job/37/Job-37-16.html"&gt;Job 37:16&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/139/Psalm-139-2.html"&gt;Psalm …&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Did God Know Satan Would Rebel?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question of whether God knew that Satan would rebel is an important one. According to the Bible, God is described as being omniscient, meaning that He is all-knowing. This concept is supported by various passages in Scripture such as &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Job/37/Job-37-16.html"&gt;Job 37:16&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/139/Psalm-139-2.html"&gt;Psalm 139:2&lt;/a&gt;–4 and 147:5, &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Proverbs/5/Proverbs-5-21.html"&gt;Proverbs 5:21&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/46/Isaiah-46-9.html"&gt;Isaiah 46:9-10&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-John/3/1-John-3-19.html"&gt;1 John 3:19&lt;/a&gt;–20. These verses leave no doubt that God's knowledge is infinite, and He knows everything that has happened in the past, is happening now, and will happen in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we look at some of the superlatives used in these verses such as "perfect in knowledge," "his understanding has no limit," and "he knows everything," it becomes clear that God's knowledge is not just greater than our own, but infinitely greater. He knows all things completely. If God's knowledge were not perfect, there would be a deficiency in His nature. However, any deficiency in God's nature would mean that He cannot be God because His essence requires the perfection of all His attributes. Therefore, the answer to the first question is "yes, God knew that Satan would rebel."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why Did God Create Satan Knowing He Would Rebel?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second part of the question, "Why did God create Satan knowing ahead of time he was going to rebel?" is a bit trickier because the Bible does not always provide comprehensive answers to "why" questions. However, we can still gain some limited understanding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To begin with, it is important to note that saying "Satan would rebel" is not the same as saying "Satan rebelled." The angel Lucifer had free will and made his own choices. God did not create Lucifer as the devil; He created him good (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/1/Genesis-1-31.html"&gt;Genesis 1:31&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In trying to understand why God created Satan, knowing he would rebel, we should consider a few important facts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Lucifer's Original Purpose&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lucifer had a good and perfect purpose before his fall. His rebellion does not change God's original intent from something good to something bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;God's Sovereignty&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God's sovereignty extends to Satan, even in his fallen condition. This means that God is able to use Satan's evil actions to ultimately bring about God's holy plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;God's Plan of Salvation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God's plan of salvation was ordained from eternity past. Salvation requires something to be saved from, so God allowed Satan's rebellion and the spread of sin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Role of Suffering&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gaS59ddVkao" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The suffering that Satan brought into the world actually became the means by which Jesus, in His humanity, was made the complete and perfect Savior of mankind. Through His suffering, Jesus brings many sons and daughters to glory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Destruction of Satan's Work&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the very beginning, God's plan in Christ included the destruction of Satan's work. This is mentioned in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-John/3/1-John-3-8.html"&gt;1 John 3:8&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, we cannot fully understand why God created Satan, knowing he would rebel. It may be tempting to assume that things would be "better" if Satan had never been created or to declare that God should have done things differently. However, such assumptions and declarations are unwise. In fact, claiming that we know better than God how to run the universe is falling into the same sin as the devil himself when he tried to exalt himself above the Most High (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/14/Isaiah-14-13.html"&gt;Isaiah 14:13&lt;/a&gt;–14).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding why God created Satan, knowing he would rebel, is significant for several reasons. Firstly, it highlights the sovereignty and omniscience of God. It reminds us that He is in control of all things, even the actions of rebellious beings. Secondly, it emphasizes the importance of free will. Lucifer had the ability to make his own choices, and his rebellion serves as a reminder that even creatures created good can choose to reject God. Finally, it points to the ultimate victory of Christ over Satan and sin. God's plan of redemption and salvation is not thwarted by rebellion, but rather accomplished through it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Think About It&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reflecting on the fact that God knew Satan would rebel, yet still created him, raises several thought-provoking questions. It challenges us to consider our own understanding of God's sovereignty and His purposes in allowing evil to exist. It also invites us to reflect on our own choices and the consequences they have in light of God's omniscience. Ultimately, it should lead us to a place of humility and trust in God's perfect wisdom and plan for our lives.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/God and Evil/The Existence of Sin and Evil"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Is God Mad at Me?

However, it is important to understand how God's anger differs from human anger and to recognize …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Is God Mad at Me?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Christians, we may sometimes question whether God is angry with us. This is often based on our own feelings of guilt or when we experience difficulties in life. However, it is important to understand how God's anger differs from human anger and to recognize His immense love and mercy towards us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Understanding God's Anger&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God's anger is not petty or temperamental. It is based on His holiness and is a just response to violations of His character. Unlike human anger, which often fails to produce righteousness, God's anger is motivated by righteousness and is never out of proportion. He is not threatened or belittled by us because He is all-powerful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Bible, we see numerous examples of God's anger being aroused over sin and the destruction it brings. However, even in His anger, God's love and mercy are evident. He delivered His people from oppression many times and took note of their distress. He sent prophets to warn them and always preserved a remnant. Ultimately, God provided a way of restoration through the promised Messiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;God's Patience and Love&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God's anger has a limit, and there is always the prospect of forgiveness for those who repent. He is patient with us because He desires everyone to come to repentance. When we put our faith in Jesus Christ, we no longer need to fear God's wrath. Through Christ, we have peace with God, and nothing can separate us from His love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Eq6LECrhCv8" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is important to note that even though we are saved by grace through faith in Jesus Christ, sin still has consequences in this world. We may still experience the natural consequences of our wrongdoing or endure the effects of living in a fallen world. However, these consequences are not indicators of God's anger towards us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;God's Discipline and Our Growth&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, when we go through difficulties or feel distant from God, it is an opportunity for self-reflection and examination of our hearts and lives. God may discipline us as His children to produce righteousness, peace, and perseverance. We can endure trials with joy, knowing that they refine us and grow us to be more like Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In these moments, we should turn to God in prayer and rest in the promises of His Word. We can trust in His unchanging nature and the depth of His love. Instead of worrying whether God is mad at us, we should focus on seeking forgiveness, relying on God's grace, and living in accordance with His will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding God's anger and His love for us is crucial for our relationship with Him. It helps us avoid misconceptions about His character and dispels fear or guilt that may hinder our faith. Recognizing that God's anger is motivated by righteousness and that He always provides a path to forgiveness encourages us to seek reconciliation with Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does understanding God's anger and love affect your view of Him?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have you ever mistaken the natural consequences of sin or difficulties in life as indicators of God's anger? How can you remind yourself of His mercy and love in those moments?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reflect on a time when you experienced discipline from God. How did it shape your character or draw you closer to Him?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can you cultivate a deeper trust in God's unchanging nature and love for you?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember, as believers in Jesus Christ, we can have confidence that God is not mad at us. He has shown His love for us through Christ's sacrifice, and through Him, we have been reconciled to God. Let us rest in His love, seek forgiveness when needed, and live with gratitude for His mercy and grace.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/God's Relationship to Us/He Cares For Us"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Divine Revelation: Unveiling God as the Ultimate First Cause</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/god-first-cause/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-07-28T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-07-28T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-07-28:/god-first-cause/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;God as the First Cause&lt;/h2&gt;

Therefore, there must be …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;God as the First Cause&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept of the first cause arises from the law of cause and effect, which states that every effect has a cause. If there were an infinite chain of causality extending into the past, there would never have been a present. Therefore, there must be something that itself has no cause and that caused everything else. While people may debate over the identity of this first cause, it is logically undeniable that it exists. In fact, it almost makes more sense to ask if the first cause is God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we combine reason with observation, we can glean insights about the nature of this first cause. Ultimately, these characteristics align with the God depicted in the Bible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Eternal and Uncaused&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first cause must be eternal, without a beginning, and not caused by anything else. According to &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/1/John-1-3.html"&gt;John 1:3&lt;/a&gt;, God is not made but exists independently. He is eternal and has always existed (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/90/Psalm-90-2.html"&gt;Psalm 90:2&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Understanding that God is eternal helps us grasp His unchanging nature and timeless existence. It also reinforces our belief in His sovereignty and power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; Consider how your understanding of God might change if you believed He had a beginning or was caused by something else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Necessary and Noncontingent&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first cause is necessary, meaning it must exist and cannot not exist. Everything else, in contrast, is contingent, depending on something else for its existence. God fits this description perfectly as He is self-existent and does not rely on anything for His existence (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Exodus/3/Exodus-3-14.html"&gt;Exodus 3:14&lt;/a&gt;). He is the creator and caused all other things (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/1/Genesis-1-1.html"&gt;Genesis 1:1&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/1/Hebrews-1-3.html"&gt;Hebrews 1:3&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Recognizing God as necessary reaffirms His supreme authority and sets Him apart from all other created beings. It highlights His role as the sustainer of everything in existence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; How does understanding God as necessary affect your view of His involvement in the world and your own life?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Changeless and Perfect&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first cause must be changeless, unaffected by external forces or events. It is also perfect, serving as the standard for all other things. In the Bible, God is described as unchanging (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Malachi/3/Malachi-3-6.html"&gt;Malachi 3:6&lt;/a&gt;) and perfect (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/6/Isaiah-6-3.html"&gt;Isaiah 6:3&lt;/a&gt;). He is the source of all that is (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/2/Genesis-2-3.html"&gt;Genesis 2:3&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Recognizing God's changelessness reassures us of His faithfulness and consistency. Understanding His perfection helps us grasp the depth of His wisdom and righteousness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; How might your perception of God's character and attributes change if you believed He could be influenced or improved upon?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Creative and Intelligent&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mbGxtfboRhQ" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Observing the diversity and complexity in the natural world suggests that the first cause must be creative and phenomenally intelligent. The Bible affirms this, stating that God is the creator of all things (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/147/Psalm-147-4.html"&gt;Psalm 147:4&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/19/Psalm-19-1.html"&gt;Psalm 19:1&lt;/a&gt;) and His understanding is beyond measure (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/55/Isaiah-55-8.html"&gt;Isaiah 55:8&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Recognizing God's creativity and intelligence helps us appreciate the intricate beauty and purpose in the world around us. It also highlights His ability to bring order out of chaos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; How does recognizing God's creativity and intelligence impact your understanding of human creativity and intelligence?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Powerful and Personal&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To create and sustain everything, the first cause must possess incredible power. Additionally, the existence of intelligent life in a universe finely tuned for life suggests that the first cause is personal. The Bible describes God as supremely powerful (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Job/38/Job-38-1.html"&gt;Job 38:1&lt;/a&gt;–7) and personal, governing both physical properties and moral standards (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Deuteronomy/32/Deuteronomy-32-4.html"&gt;Deuteronomy 32:4&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Recognizing God's power assures us of His ability to overcome any challenge or obstacle. Understanding His personhood allows for a personal relationship with Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; How does recognizing God's power and personhood impact your prayer life and your understanding of morality?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Trinity as the Best Explanation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The uniqueness and unity found in the universe suggest that the first cause must be both diverse and unified. This concept aligns with the Christian belief in the Trinity. Just as the universe exhibits both diversity and unity, so does the Trinity, which consists of three distinct persons yet remains one God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Understanding the Trinity helps us comprehend God's nature and His relationship with humanity. It also emphasizes the importance of unity and diversity within the Christian community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; How does understanding the Trinity affect your understanding of God's love, community, and individuality?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, when we explore the idea of the first cause through reason and observation, we find that it aligns with the God described in the Bible. While different approaches may use varying terminology, they ultimately point to God as the first cause. Recognizing God as eternal, necessary, changeless, perfect, creative, intelligent, powerful, personal, and triune deepens our understanding of His character and His role as the source of all existence.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/The Identity of God/The Origin of God"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Unveiling the Almighty: Exploring the God of the Old Testament</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/god-of-the-old-testament/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-07-27T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-07-27T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-07-27:/god-of-the-old-testament/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;The God of the Old Testament&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The God of the Old Testament is often criticized for being portrayed as immoral and evil. However, it is important to approach these critiques with a fair understanding of the biblical context and historical background. Let's address some key points that shed light on this topic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;God's Warnings and Judgments&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One common criticism is that God's judgments involved the killing of certain people. However, a closer examination reveals a pattern in how God arrives at His declarations of judgment:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;God warns of a coming judgment to remove moral corruption from His creation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Individual judgments are handed down for extreme acts of evil.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Each judgment is preceded by warnings and often long periods of time for people to repent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The presence of "good" or "innocent" people in a situation can delay or stop judgment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A way of escape is usually provided, and those who disregard it receive judgment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Redemption from the culture receiving judgment is possible for individuals or groups.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we were to witness the evil actions judged by God in the Old Testament today, we would likely call for immediate action to stop such atrocities. Therefore, it is not fair to criticize God for carrying out severe judgments on national evil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Understanding God's warnings and judgments helps us see His desire for justice and righteousness in the world. It also reminds us that God's actions are not arbitrary but are based on principles of morality and His ultimate plan for humanity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; How does considering the context and purpose behind God's judgments influence your understanding of His character?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Misconceptions about God&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several misconceptions about God's character in the Old Testament that need clarification:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is God misogynistic? The Bible affirms that women are equal to men in nature, value of life, redemptive status, spiritual gifting, political leadership, and business leadership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is God infanticidal? No, God declares love and protection for children, including the unborn. Children only experienced judgments from God when their parents resisted calls for repentance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is God filicidal? The story of Abraham being asked to sacrifice his son Isaac is often misunderstood. God allowed this episode to foreshadow the future sacrifice of His own Son and knew that Isaac would not die.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is God homophobic? No, God offers His grace and redemption to everyone, including homosexuals. The Bible addresses certain sexual behaviors as sinful but also provides a path to forgiveness and transformation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is God racist? No, God is the Creator of all and made all people in His image. The judgments carried out in response to people's sin were not racially motivated, as Israel itself was held accountable in the same way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Clarifying these misconceptions helps us understand the true character of God and His love for all people, regardless of gender, age, or background.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CUYX2nkRD2I" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; How do these clarifications challenge or affirm your previous understanding of God's character?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;God's Mercy and Love&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God's mercy and love were well-known in Old Testament times. Despite the portrayal of judgment, there are numerous instances where God shows mercy and offers redemption:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The word "mercy" is used four times more often in the Old Testament than in the New Testament.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The prophet Jonah knew of God's mercy but resisted delivering a warning to Nineveh because he did not want them to be saved.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;God is described as gracious, compassionate, slow to anger, abounding in love, and willing to relent from sending calamity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding God's mercy helps us see that He desires repentance and restoration rather than immediate judgment. It also reveals His willingness to extend grace even to those who have sinned greatly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Recognizing God's mercy and love in the Old Testament helps us appreciate His desire for reconciliation and highlights the continuity of His character throughout Scripture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; How does the concept of God's mercy in the Old Testament impact your understanding of His relationship with humanity?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, the caricature of God presented by critics is far from an accurate portrayal of the God of the Old Testament. By examining the biblical context and historical background, we can see that God's actions are rooted in justice, righteousness, and a desire for repentance and redemption. Clarifying misconceptions about God's character further reveals His love, equality, and willingness to extend mercy. Understanding these aspects deepens our understanding of God's nature and His relationship with humanity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Testing is a concept that is often associated with God in the Christian faith. Many believers have wondered why God tests us or allows us to be tested. In order to understand this, we must first acknowledge that testing does indeed come from Him. When God tests His children, He is doing something valuable and purposeful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Purpose of Testing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biblical accounts provide us with insight into the purpose of testing. For example, King David sought God's testing, asking Him to examine his heart and mind to ensure they were true to Him (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/26/Psalm-26-2.html"&gt;Psalm 26:2&lt;/a&gt;; 139:23). Additionally, Abram was tested by God when he was asked to sacrifice his son Isaac. Abram obediently followed God's command and demonstrated to the world that he is the father of faith (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/11/Hebrews-11-17.html"&gt;Hebrews 11:17&lt;/a&gt;–19; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/4/Romans-4-16.html"&gt;Romans 4:16&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout the Old and New Testaments, the word "test" means "to prove by trial." Therefore, when God tests His children, His purpose is to prove that our faith is real. It is not that God needs to prove it to Himself since He knows all things, but rather He is proving it to us. Through testing, God assures us that our faith is genuine, that we are truly His children, and that no trial will overcome our faith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Benefits of Testing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Parable of the Sower, Jesus identifies those who fall away as individuals who receive the seed of God's Word with joy but stumble when faced with testing. James also emphasizes that testing develops perseverance, which leads to maturity in our walk with God (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/James/1/James-1-3.html"&gt;James 1:3&lt;/a&gt;–4). Furthermore, James refers to testing as a blessing because it ultimately leads to receiving the crown of life promised by God to those who love Him (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/James/1/James-1-12.html"&gt;James 1:12&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Testing comes from our heavenly Father who works all things together for the good of those who love Him and are called to be His children (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/8/Romans-8-28.html"&gt;Romans 8:28&lt;/a&gt;). Therefore, even though testing may be challenging and uncomfortable, it serves a greater purpose in our spiritual growth and completeness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Nature of Testing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Testing or trials can manifest in various ways. Accepting Christ often requires us to step out of our comfort zones and embrace the unknown. Persevering through testing results in spiritual maturity and completeness. This is why James encourages believers to consider it pure joy when facing trials of many kinds (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/James/1/James-1-2.html"&gt;James 1:2&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The testing of faith can come in different forms, ranging from daily irritations and small challenges to severe afflictions (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/48/Isaiah-48-10.html"&gt;Isaiah 48:10&lt;/a&gt;) and attacks from Satan (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Job/2/Job-2-7.html"&gt;Job 2:7&lt;/a&gt;). Regardless of the source, undergoing trials allows us to benefit from God's refining process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2EibSQdq-mw" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;God's Sovereign Control&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The account of Job provides a perfect example of how God allows one of His faithful servants to be tested by the devil. Job endured his trials patiently and did not blame God for his suffering (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Job/1/Job-1-22.html"&gt;Job 1:22&lt;/a&gt;). However, Job's story also reveals that Satan's ability to test us is limited by God's sovereign control. No demonic force can test or afflict us beyond what God has ordained. All our trials work toward God's perfect purpose and our ultimate benefit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Positive Results of Testing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bible offers numerous examples that showcase the positive outcomes of being tested. The psalmist compares our testing to the refining process of silver (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/66/Psalm-66-10.html"&gt;Psalm 66:10&lt;/a&gt;). Peter also emphasizes the worth of our faith compared to gold and explains that we suffer grief in various trials to refine our faith (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-Peter/1/1-Peter-1-6.html"&gt;1 Peter 1:6&lt;/a&gt;–7). Through testing, God enables us to grow into strong disciples who live by faith rather than relying solely on what we see (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/2-Corinthians/5/2-Corinthians-5-7.html"&gt;2 Corinthians 5:7&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Trusting God in Testing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we experience the storms of life, it is crucial that we respond by digging our roots more deeply into God's Word. Just as a tree digs its roots deeper for a stronger grip in the earth during a storm, we must anchor ourselves in God's promises and cling to His truth. By doing so, we can weather any storm that comes against us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding why God tests us is essential for believers. It helps us maintain a proper perspective when faced with trials and challenges. Recognizing that testing is a means of proving our faith strengthens our resolve to persevere and grow in our walk with God. Embracing the purpose of testing allows us to trust in God's sovereignty and His ability to work all things together for our good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does knowing that testing proves the authenticity of our faith affect your perspective on trials and challenges?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reflect on past experiences of testing in your life. How did those trials contribute to your spiritual growth?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In what ways can you deepen your roots in God's Word during times of testing?&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suffering is a universal experience that affects all people to some degree. While some suffering may be a consequence of personal choices or sinful actions, there are instances where innocent individuals endure hardship. This raises the question: why would God allow innocent people to suffer? In addressing this issue, it is important to understand that suffering does not necessarily equate to personal sin or guilt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Misconception of Sin and Suffering&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is natural for humans to seek a connection between bad behavior and negative circumstances, as well as between good behavior and blessings. However, Jesus confronted this misconception on multiple occasions. In one instance, His disciples asked whether a man born blind had sinned or if his parents were to blame. Jesus corrected their thinking, stating that neither the man nor his parents sinned. Instead, Jesus explained that the man's blindness was an opportunity for God's works to be displayed (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/9/John-9-1.html"&gt;John 9:1&lt;/a&gt;–3).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In another incident, Jesus addressed the deaths of individuals who were killed in an accident when a tower fell on them. He dismissed the idea that these individuals were more guilty than others living in Jerusalem. Jesus emphasized that tragedy and suffering are not necessarily the result of personal sin. However, He also highlighted the reality of living in a fallen world where sin and its effects are present (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/13/Luke-13-4.html"&gt;Luke 13:4&lt;/a&gt;–5).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Concept of Innocence&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The notion of innocence becomes a complex matter when considering biblical teachings. According to Scripture, "all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/3/Romans-3-23.html"&gt;Romans 3:23&lt;/a&gt;). Therefore, from a biblical perspective, no one is truly "innocent" in the sense of being sinless. Due to humanity's fallen nature inherited from Adam, all individuals are born with a sinful inclination (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/5/Romans-5-12.html"&gt;Romans 5:12&lt;/a&gt;). Consequently, suffering is an inevitable consequence of living in a fallen world where sin's effects permeate everything (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/8/Romans-8-22.html"&gt;Romans 8:22&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most heartbreaking instances of suffering is when it affects children. Children represent a close approximation to innocence in this world, and their suffering is truly tragic. Sometimes, innocent children suffer as a result of the sins of others, such as neglect, abuse, or drunk driving. In these cases, the suffering is directly linked to personal sin, albeit not committed by the child. It serves as a reminder that our actions can have profound effects on those around us. Other times, innocent children suffer due to what may be considered "acts of God," such as natural disasters, accidents, or childhood cancer. Even in these cases, suffering can be attributed to sin in a general sense because we live in a fallen world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Redemption and Purpose of Suffering&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zeaZhbuPjnM" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it may seem that innocent suffering is without purpose, God does not leave us to suffer aimlessly. He has a perfect plan to redeem and utilize suffering for His threefold purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Drawing Us Closer to Him&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pain and suffering serve as catalysts that draw us closer to God. Jesus Himself declared, "In this world you will have trouble" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/16/John-16-33.html"&gt;John 16:33&lt;/a&gt;). Trials and distress are not unusual; they are an inherent part of life in a fallen world. In times of despair and sorrow, we naturally reach out to God for comfort and strength. As His children, we find that He is always there to comfort and uphold us through every trial. This experience solidifies our faith in His faithfulness and ensures our continual reliance on Him. Moreover, as we experience God's comfort during our own trials, we are then able to extend that same comfort to others who are suffering (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/2-Corinthians/1/2-Corinthians-1-4.html"&gt;2 Corinthians 1:4&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Understanding that suffering can draw us closer to God provides hope and reassurance during difficult times. It reminds us that God is present even in the midst of our suffering and that He can use our pain to strengthen our faith and bring comfort to others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; Reflect on a time when you experienced suffering or witnessed the suffering of someone close to you. How did that experience draw you closer to God or impact your relationship with Him? How were you able to extend comfort to others who were suffering?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Testing and Proving Our Faith&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suffering also serves as a means of testing and proving the genuineness of our faith. How we respond to suffering, especially when we are innocent of any wrongdoing, reveals the authenticity of our faith. Those who have placed their faith in Jesus, the pioneer and perfecter of faith (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/12/Hebrews-12-2.html"&gt;Hebrews 12:2&lt;/a&gt;), will not be crushed by suffering. Instead, they emerge from trials with their faith intact, having been tested by fire. This testing results in praise, glory, and honor when Jesus Christ is revealed (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-Peter/1/1-Peter-1-7.html"&gt;1 Peter 1:7&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genuine faith does not lead individuals to question God's goodness or shake their fists at Him in times of suffering. Instead, it allows them to consider it pure joy because they understand that trials prove their status as children of God (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/James/1/James-1-2.html"&gt;James 1:2&lt;/a&gt;). Those who persevere under trial will receive the crown of life promised by the Lord to those who love Him (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/James/1/James-1-12.html"&gt;James 1:12&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Recognizing that our faith is tested through suffering helps us understand that challenges and hardships are not indications of God's abandonment or punishment. Instead, they provide an opportunity for us to demonstrate the authenticity of our faith and ultimately receive eternal rewards from God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; Reflect on a difficult time in your life when your faith was tested. How did you respond? How did your faith grow stronger as a result? In what ways might your faith be refined through future trials?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Shifting Our Focus to the Eternal Kingdom&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suffering can redirect our gaze from the temporal things of this world to the eternal kingdom of God. The Bible repeatedly exhorts believers not to become entangled in the affairs of this world but to fix their eyes on the world to come. While innocent suffering may impact this present life, it is essential to remember that this world and everything in it will pass away. The kingdom of God, however, is eternal. Jesus affirmed that His kingdom is not of this world (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/18/John-18-36.html"&gt;John 18:36&lt;/a&gt;). Those who follow Him understand that the circumstances of this life, whether good or bad, do not have the final say. Even the most terrible sufferings endured here cannot compare to the glory that will be revealed in us (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/8/Romans-8-18.html"&gt;Romans 8:18&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Recognizing the temporary nature of suffering enables us to maintain an eternal perspective and find hope in God's promises. It reminds us that our ultimate destiny lies beyond this world and that our suffering is not in vain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; Consider how your perspective on suffering might change when you focus on the eternal kingdom of God. How can you cultivate an eternal perspective in your daily life, especially during times of suffering?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;God's Good Purpose in Suffering&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it is within God's power to prevent all suffering, He assures us that "all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/8/Romans-8-28.html"&gt;Romans 8:28&lt;/a&gt;, KJV). This includes innocent suffering, as it forms part of the "all things" that God uses to accomplish His good purposes ultimately. We can trust in God's perfect plan and flawless character, knowing that He will not disappoint those who place their trust in Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, innocent suffering exists in a fallen world where sin's effects are pervasive. However, God can redeem and utilize suffering for His purposes. He uses suffering to draw us closer to Him, test and prove the authenticity of our faith, and shift our focus from the temporary to the eternal. Understanding these truths can provide comfort, strengthen our faith, and help us persevere in the face of suffering.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/God and Evil/Hardships"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Discovering the Divine: Unveiling the True Identity of God for Christian Believers</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/who-is-god/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-07-25T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-07-25T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-07-25:/who-is-god/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Who is God?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The existence of God is evident in both creation and the human conscience, as stated in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/14/Psalm-14-1.html"&gt;Psalm 14:1&lt;/a&gt;. Therefore, the Bible does not attempt to prove God's existence but assumes it from the beginning (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/1/Genesis-1-1.html"&gt;Genesis 1:1&lt;/a&gt;). Instead, the Bible reveals God's nature, character, and …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Who is God?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The existence of God is evident in both creation and the human conscience, as stated in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/14/Psalm-14-1.html"&gt;Psalm 14:1&lt;/a&gt;. Therefore, the Bible does not attempt to prove God's existence but assumes it from the beginning (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/1/Genesis-1-1.html"&gt;Genesis 1:1&lt;/a&gt;). Instead, the Bible reveals God's nature, character, and work. It is crucial to have a correct understanding of God because false ideas about Him lead to idolatry. In simple terms, God can be defined as the Supreme Being, the Creator and Ruler of all things, and the Self-existent One who is perfect in power, goodness, and wisdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Characteristics of God&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;God's Spiritual Nature&lt;/strong&gt;: God is a spirit and cannot be physically perceived (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/4/John-4-24.html"&gt;John 4:24&lt;/a&gt;). This means that He does not have a physical body like humans do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Trinity&lt;/strong&gt;: While God is One, He exists as three distinct Persons - God the Father, God the Son (Jesus Christ), and God the Holy Spirit (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/3/Matthew-3-16.html"&gt;Matthew 3:16-17&lt;/a&gt;). This concept is difficult to fully comprehend but can be understood through an analogy of water existing in three forms: solid (ice), liquid (water), and gas (steam). Although different forms, they are all H2O.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;God's Attributes&lt;/strong&gt;: God possesses various attributes that define His nature. Some of these include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Infinite&lt;/strong&gt;: God has no limits or boundaries (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-Timothy/1/1-Timothy-1-17.html"&gt;1 Timothy 1:17&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Incomparable&lt;/strong&gt;: There is no one like God (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/2-Samuel/7/2-Samuel-7-22.html"&gt;2 Samuel 7:22&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unchanging&lt;/strong&gt;: God remains the same throughout time (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Malachi/3/Malachi-3-6.html"&gt;Malachi 3:6&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Omnipresent&lt;/strong&gt;: God exists everywhere simultaneously (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/139/Psalm-139-7.html"&gt;Psalm 139:7-12&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Omniscient&lt;/strong&gt;: God knows everything (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/147/Psalm-147-5.html"&gt;Psalm 147:5&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/40/Isaiah-40-28.html"&gt;Isaiah 40:28&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All-powerful&lt;/strong&gt;: God has all power and authority (Ephesians 1; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Revelation/19/Revelation-19-6.html"&gt;Revelation 19:6&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_ie9musGEqQ" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;God's Moral Attributes&lt;/strong&gt;: God is just, loving, truthful, and holy. He shows compassion, mercy, and grace. He judges sin but also offers forgiveness (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Acts/17/Acts-17-31.html"&gt;Acts 17:31&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Ephesians/2/Ephesians-2-4.html"&gt;Ephesians 2:4-5&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/14/John-14-6.html"&gt;John 14:6&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-John/1/1-John-1-5.html"&gt;1 John 1:5&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/2-Corinthians/1/2-Corinthians-1-3.html"&gt;2 Corinthians 1:3&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/9/Romans-9-15.html"&gt;Romans 9:15&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/5/Romans-5-17.html"&gt;Romans 5:17&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/5/Psalm-5-5.html"&gt;Psalm 5:5&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/130/Psalm-130-4.html"&gt;Psalm 130:4&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Understanding God through His Works&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To understand God fully, we must examine His works because what God does flows from who He is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Creation&lt;/strong&gt;: God is the Creator of the world (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/1/Genesis-1-1.html"&gt;Genesis 1:1&lt;/a&gt;) and everything in it. He brought the universe into existence out of nothing. The complexity and beauty of creation point to God's intelligence and creativity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sustenance&lt;/strong&gt;: God actively sustains the world by upholding its existence (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Colossians/1/Colossians-1-17.html"&gt;Colossians 1:17&lt;/a&gt;). Every breath we take and every moment we live is a result of God's sustaining power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Redemption&lt;/strong&gt;: God has an eternal plan that involves redeeming humanity from the curse of sin and death (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Ephesians/1/Ephesians-1-11.html"&gt;Ephesians 1:11&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Galatians/3/Galatians-3-13.html"&gt;Galatians 3:13-14&lt;/a&gt;). This plan centers around Jesus Christ, who became incarnate as the Son of Man to bridge the gap between God and humanity (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/1/John-1-14.html"&gt;John 1:14&lt;/a&gt;). Through Jesus, we can have forgiveness of sins, reconciliation with God, and eternal salvation (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Ephesians/1/Ephesians-1-7.html"&gt;Ephesians 1:7&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/15/John-15-15.html"&gt;John 15:15&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/5/Romans-5-10.html"&gt;Romans 5:10&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/2-Timothy/2/2-Timothy-2-10.html"&gt;2 Timothy 2:10&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Divine Intervention&lt;/strong&gt;: God is actively involved in our lives. He draws people to Jesus (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/6/John-6-44.html"&gt;John 6:44&lt;/a&gt;), disciplines His children (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/12/Hebrews-12-6.html"&gt;Hebrews 12:6&lt;/a&gt;), and will judge the world in the future (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Revelation/20/Revelation-20-11.html"&gt;Revelation 20:11-15&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding who God is and His nature is essential for our faith and relationship with Him. It helps us avoid idolatry and worshiping false gods. Knowing that God is just, loving, merciful, and gracious gives us confidence in His character. Recognizing His power and authority helps us trust that He is in control of all things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does knowing that God is present everywhere and knows everything impact your daily life?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does understanding God's attributes affect your perspective on difficult situations?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In what ways can you apply the knowledge of God's character and works to your relationship with Him?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, God is the Supreme Being, the Creator and Ruler of all things, who reveals Himself through creation, conscience, and His Word. He possesses various attributes that define His nature, including being infinite, incomparable, unchanging, omnipresent, omniscient, and all-powerful. God's moral attributes include justice, love, truthfulness, holiness, compassion, mercy, grace, judgment of sin, and forgiveness. Understanding God's works, such as creation, sustenance, redemption through Jesus Christ, and divine intervention, helps us grasp the depth of His love and involvement in our lives. Knowing who God is deepens our faith and relationship with Him.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/The Nature of God/The Basics"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Unlocking the Power of Anthropopathism in Christian Worship</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/anthropopathism/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-07-24T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-07-24T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-07-24:/anthropopathism/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Anthropopathism&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the Bible, there are instances where human characteristics are ascribed to God using metaphorical language. These figures of speech are known as anthropomorphisms, meaning "human form." One type of anthropomorphism is anthropopathism, which attributes human emotions to God. While these descriptions are not literal, they help readers relate to God on a more personal level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Understanding anthropopathism helps us grasp the poetic and figurative nature of certain passages in the Bible. It enables us to appreciate the depth of God's character and relate to Him in a way that resonates with our own emotions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Anthropomorphic Language&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To comprehend anthropopathic descriptions in the Bible, it's important to recognize their symbolic meaning. God is fundamentally a spiritual being (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/4/John-4-24.html"&gt;John 4:24&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-Timothy/1/1-Timothy-1-17.html"&gt;1 Timothy 1:17&lt;/a&gt;), so passages that depict Him with physical attributes, such as arms or sitting down, are anthropomorphic. These descriptions should not be taken literally but rather understood as metaphorical expressions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Anthropopathic Emotions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bible attributes a range of emotions to God. Some of these emotions elicit positive responses from readers, such as rejoicing, compassion, and yearning. These descriptions align with God's love and goodness. However, certain passages may present challenges when emotions like regret or repentance are ascribed to God. It is important to interpret these descriptions carefully and in light of God's holy and righteous nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; How does it affect your understanding of God's character when you consider that these emotional descriptions are figurative rather than literal? How might this deepen your relationship with Him?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Regret and Repentance&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/x0ISjlQrfKc" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the account of Noah and the flood, Moses describes how God was displeased with the wickedness on earth (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/6/Genesis-6-5.html"&gt;Genesis 6:5&lt;/a&gt;). The text goes on to say that God "regretted" or "was sorry" that He had made humankind. However, it is crucial to note that these terms should not be taken to mean that God was remorseful over His own sin. Rather, they express His sorrow and disappointment in response to human sin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A similar use of anthropopathic language is found in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-Samuel/15/1-Samuel-15-11.html"&gt;1 Samuel 15:11&lt;/a&gt;, where God expresses regret over making Saul king. Again, this should not be understood as God admitting wrongdoing or confessing guilt. Instead, it conveys His sorrow in response to Saul's disobedience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Nuanced Meanings&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When examining these passages, it is important to consider how certain words used in Bible translations can have nuanced meanings. For example, the word "sorry" can imply an admission of wrongdoing, but it can also express sorrow without indicating moral irresponsibility. Similarly, the word "repent" can convey grief over the sins of others rather than personal guilt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The King James Version (KJV) uses the word "repented" in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Judges/21/Judges-21-6.html"&gt;Judges 21:6&lt;/a&gt; to describe the sorrow of the children of Israel over the sin of the tribe of Benjamin. In this context, their repentance does not imply any wrongdoing on their part.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; How does understanding the nuanced meanings of words like "sorry" and "repent" affect your interpretation of passages where these terms are used to describe God's emotions? How does it align with your understanding of His character?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Communicating Truth through Metaphor&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While anthropopathism helps us understand certain aspects of God's nature and character, it is important to remember that the ultimate expression of God's communication to humanity is found in Jesus Christ. As both fully God and fully man, Jesus experienced a range of human emotions, providing a tangible representation of God's sympathy and care for people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Recognizing that Jesus embodied human emotions allows us to connect with Him on a deeply personal level. It reminds us that God understands our struggles and emotions because He experienced them firsthand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anthropopathism in the Bible uses figurative language to portray God's emotions in ways that resonate with human experiences. These descriptions should not be taken literally, but they convey important truths about God's nature and character. Understanding anthropopathism helps us appreciate the depth of God's love, compassion, and other emotions, while also recognizing the limitations of human language in describing the divine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; By understanding anthropopathism, we can engage with the Bible more deeply, recognizing the richness of its figurative language. This understanding allows us to approach God with a greater sense of awe and appreciation for His unfathomable nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; How does knowing that God uses anthropopathic language to communicate truth about Himself impact your reading and interpretation of the Bible? How might it change your perspective on His character and how you relate to Him?&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/The Character of God/Anthropomorphism"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Divine Authority: Understanding God''s Imposing Will</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/god-imposing/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-07-23T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-07-23T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-07-23:/god-imposing/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;God's Nature: Love Personified&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most profound statements in the Bible is "God is love" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-John/4/1-John-4-8.html"&gt;1 John 4:8&lt;/a&gt;). This declaration holds immense significance as it reveals that love is not just something God does, but it is an inherent part of His very nature. Love permeates every …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;God's Nature: Love Personified&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most profound statements in the Bible is "God is love" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-John/4/1-John-4-8.html"&gt;1 John 4:8&lt;/a&gt;). This declaration holds immense significance as it reveals that love is not just something God does, but it is an inherent part of His very nature. Love permeates every aspect of who He is, even His wrath and anger. When we see God as angry, it is essential to understand that His anger is filtered through His great love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Love and Anger in God&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God's anger is never directed towards His children, those who have come to Christ in faith for forgiveness of sins. All His anger was poured out on His own Son, Jesus, on the cross. For those who have placed their faith in Christ, God sees them as perfect because they are covered by Jesus' righteousness. Therefore, He will never be angry with them again. The Bible tells us that "God is angry with the wicked every day" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/7/Psalm-7-11.html"&gt;Psalm 7:11&lt;/a&gt;), but as believers in Christ, we are not counted among the wicked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Requirement of Perfection&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While God's nature is loving, it does not negate His requirement of perfection. However, because He is loving, He sent Christ to die on the cross in our place, satisfying God's demand for perfection. Through Jesus' sacrifice, we can now enter into a relationship with God and become a part of His family. This acceptance into God's family is solely based on the finished work of Christ on the cross.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Examining Our Relationship with God&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we still perceive God as imposing and angry despite knowing these truths, it may indicate uncertainty about our relationship with Him. The Bible encourages us to examine ourselves to determine whether we truly belong to Christ (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/2-Corinthians/13/2-Corinthians-13-5.html"&gt;2 Corinthians 13:5&lt;/a&gt;). If we doubt our salvation, we can repent and ask Him to save us. He will forgive our sins and give us His Holy Spirit, assuring us of our status as His children. Once we are confident of our place in God's family, we can draw closer to Him by reading and studying His Word, seeking to know Him more intimately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding that God is love and that His anger is filtered through His great love helps us view Him in a more accurate light. It enables us to approach Him not with fear and apprehension but with confidence and assurance of His love for us. Recognizing that God's anger was fully satisfied through Jesus' sacrifice on the cross assures us that we are no longer objects of His wrath. Instead, we are recipients of His grace and mercy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ICI5Yr8v0nc" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider how your perception of God's nature impacts your relationship with Him. Are there any misunderstandings or misconceptions that need to be addressed? Take time to reflect on the truth that God is love and how that truth can transform your perspective and experience with Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Seeking a Personal Relationship with a Loving Father&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God desires a personal relationship with each one of us. He loves us deeply and wants us to know Him intimately as a loving and gracious Father. He has assured us that if we seek Him with all our hearts, we will find Him (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Jeremiah/29/Jeremiah-29-13.html"&gt;Jeremiah 29:13&lt;/a&gt;). Through this pursuit, we can truly know Him, not as an imposing and angry figure, but as a loving Father who longs to have a close relationship with His children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Approaching God in Faith&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Approaching God in faith is the key to establishing a personal relationship with Him. It involves acknowledging our need for forgiveness and salvation, recognizing Jesus as the only way to reconcile with God. When we come to God in faith, repenting of our sins and accepting Jesus as our Savior, He forgives us, cleanses us, and adopts us into His family. This act of faith opens the door for a personal relationship with Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Role of the Holy Spirit&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once we have placed our faith in Christ, God gives us the gift of His Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit takes up residence in our hearts and serves as our constant companion and guide. He assures us of our salvation, reminds us of God's truth, convicts us of sin, and empowers us to live in obedience to God's Word.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Growing Closer to God&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To cultivate a deeper relationship with God, we need to actively engage with Him. Reading and studying His Word, the Bible, is crucial for understanding His character, His promises, and His will for our lives. Through the Scriptures, God speaks to us, reveals Himself, and instructs us on how to live according to His ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prayer is another essential component of nurturing our relationship with God. It is through prayer that we communicate with Him, pour out our hearts, seek His guidance, and experience His presence. Prayer is not merely about making requests but also about listening to God's voice and aligning our hearts with His.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seeking a personal relationship with God is more than just a religious duty; it is a transformative journey that brings fulfillment and purpose to our lives. Knowing God intimately allows us to experience His love, receive His guidance, and find peace in His presence. It is through this relationship that we find true satisfaction and discover our true identity as beloved children of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reflect on your own relationship with God. Are you actively seeking to grow closer to Him? How can you deepen your understanding of Him through studying His Word and spending time in prayer? Consider taking intentional steps in nurturing your relationship with Him so that you can experience the fullness of His love and grace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God's nature is love personified. When we understand that His anger is filtered through His great love, it changes our perception of Him. We can approach Him not as an imposing and angry God but as a loving and gracious Father who desires a personal relationship with us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By placing our faith in Christ, we are covered by His righteousness, and God's anger is appeased. We become part of God's family, adopted through the finished work of Christ on the cross. As we seek Him with all our hearts, read His Word, and communicate with Him through prayer, we can grow closer to Him and experience the fullness of His love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding God's nature as love and seeking a personal relationship with Him allows us to encounter His grace, mercy, and transformative power in our lives. It is through this relationship that we find true fulfillment and discover our purpose as beloved children of God.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/Our Response to God/Knowing God"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Unlocking the Divine Favor: Secrets to Experiencing God''s Blessings</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/favor-of-god/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-07-21T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-07-21T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-07-21:/favor-of-god/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;The Favor of God&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The favor of God can be described as "demonstrated delight." It is the tangible evidence that a person has the approval of the Lord. When we favor someone, we want to be with them, delight in them, and connect with them in a special way. Similarly …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;The Favor of God&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The favor of God can be described as "demonstrated delight." It is the tangible evidence that a person has the approval of the Lord. When we favor someone, we want to be with them, delight in them, and connect with them in a special way. Similarly, God shows favor to those who delight in Him, connect with Him, and honor Him above all else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To understand how to obtain God's favor, we must first recognize that favor is closely related to grace in the Bible. The only way to receive God's favor is by believing in the Lord Jesus and accepting Him as our Savior. Through faith in Jesus, we are saved by grace (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Ephesians/2/Ephesians-2-8.html"&gt;Ephesians 2:8-9&lt;/a&gt;) and experience the favor of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God seeks out those who love Him and obey His commands so that He can bless, guide, and protect them. This does not mean that everyone who is prosperous or healthy has found favor with God, nor does it mean that those who have God's favor will never face difficulties. Many people in the Bible who had God's favor also experienced hardships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those who are favored by God know that He is with them and that nothing can happen to them apart from His good purpose. They have confidence that their sins are forgiven, they are within God's plan, and that He is there for them at all times. They walk with God as their closest friend and appreciate the blessings He provides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To seek God's favor, we need to humble our hearts before Him, seek Him for Himself rather than just His blessings, and arrange our lives around loving Him with all our heart, soul, mind, and strength. Seeking wisdom is also important in obtaining favor from the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Understanding the favor of God helps us have a deeper relationship with Him. It reminds us to seek Him above all else and pursue a life that pleases Him. Knowing that we have God's favor gives us confidence and peace, even in the midst of difficulties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; How does knowing that God's favor is not based on external circumstances but on our relationship with Him affect the way we view success and hardships? How can seeking wisdom help us obtain God's favor in our lives?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Characteristics of Those Favored by God&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bible gives us insights into the characteristics of those who find favor with God. &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/66/Isaiah-66-2.html"&gt;Isaiah 66:2&lt;/a&gt; states that God looks with favor upon those who are humble, contrite in spirit, and who tremble at His Word. Second Chronicles 16:9 tells us that God shows Himself strong on behalf of those whose hearts are perfect toward Him. Having a heart perfect toward God means seeking His favor above all else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to note that finding favor with God does not guarantee a life free from difficulties or hardships. In fact, many individuals in the Bible who were favored by God also faced challenges. However, they remained faithful to God and trusted in His plan for their lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Understanding the characteristics of those favored by God helps us evaluate our own hearts and actions. It encourages us to cultivate humility, contrition, and a reverence for God's Word in our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; How can we cultivate humility and contrition in our relationship with God? How does having a heart perfect toward God affect the way we make decisions and prioritize our lives?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Assurance and Blessings of God's Favor&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those who have found favor with God can rest assured that He is with them and that His good purpose will prevail in their lives. &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/8/Romans-8-28.html"&gt;Romans 8:28&lt;/a&gt; assures us that all things work together for good for those who love God and are called according to His purpose. This assurance gives believers confidence and peace, knowing that even in difficult times, God is working for their ultimate good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The favor of God also brings blessings. &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/5/Psalm-5-12.html"&gt;Psalm 5:12&lt;/a&gt; declares that the Lord blesses the righteous and surrounds them with His favor as with a shield. These blessings may not always be material or external, but they include the joy of knowing our sins are forgiven, being within God's plan, and experiencing His presence at all times. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Understanding the assurance and blessings that come with God's favor encourages us to trust in His plan for our lives and to find contentment in His presence, regardless of our circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It&lt;/strong&gt;: How does knowing that God's favor brings assurance and blessings change the way we view challenges and difficulties? How can we cultivate a heart of gratitude for the spiritual blessings that come with God's favor?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Seeking God's Favor&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GCxx3bAtJ_w" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Bible invites us to seek God's favor. &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/119/Psalm-119-58.html"&gt;Psalm 119:58&lt;/a&gt;, 135 urges us to seek His favor wholeheartedly. Seeking God's favor requires humility, a genuine desire for Him, and aligning our lives with His will. It means seeking His kingdom and righteousness above all else (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/6/Matthew-6-33.html"&gt;Matthew 6:33&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One way to obtain favor from the Lord is to seek wisdom. &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Proverbs/8/Proverbs-8-35.html"&gt;Proverbs 8:35&lt;/a&gt; tells us that those who find wisdom find life and receive favor from the Lord. Seeking wisdom involves seeking understanding and guidance from God's Word, allowing His wisdom to shape our thoughts, decisions, and actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Seeking God's favor is an ongoing pursuit in our relationship with Him. It helps us stay aligned with His will, find guidance in His wisdom, and experience the fullness of life He desires for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; What steps can we take to seek God's favor in our daily lives? How can seeking wisdom from God's Word impact our decision-making process?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Reality of God's Favor&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to note that God's favor is not a guarantee of a problem-free life or a sign of superiority over others. It is not an excuse for pride or judgment. The reality is that many people who are favored by God also face challenges and difficulties. In fact, the Bible is filled with examples of individuals who experienced God's favor but also endured hardships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The favor of God is not about worldly success or material blessings. It is about having a deep relationship with Him, knowing that He is with us, and experiencing His presence in our lives. It is about finding joy and contentment in His love and grace, regardless of our circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Understanding the reality of God's favor helps us avoid misunderstandings and false expectations. It keeps us humble, dependent on God, and focused on the true blessings that come from knowing Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; How does understanding the reality of God's favor change the way we view success and hardships? How can we guard against pride or judgment when we experience God's favor in our lives?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;In Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The favor of God is a tangible evidence of His delight in us. It is not based on external circumstances but on our relationship with Him. Through faith in Jesus, we receive God's grace and experience His favor. Those who are favored by God have confidence in His presence, assurance in His plan, and the blessings of His love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seeking God's favor involves humility, a genuine desire for Him, and aligning our lives with His will. It includes seeking wisdom from His Word and prioritizing His kingdom above all else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While having God's favor does not exempt us from difficulties, it gives us peace and confidence knowing that He works all things for our good. The reality of God's favor reminds us to find joy and contentment in His love and grace, regardless of our circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Understanding the favor of God deepens our relationship with Him and helps us live according to His will. It encourages us to seek His favor above all else and find contentment in His presence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; How can we cultivate a heart that seeks God's favor above all else? How does knowing that we have God's favor change the way we approach challenges and difficulties in life?&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/Our Response to God/Knowing God"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Unlocking the Miraculous Power of the God of Wonders</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/god-of-miracles/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-07-21T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-07-21T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-07-21:/god-of-miracles/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;God of Miracles&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Bible describes God as a God of miracles, who performs extraordinary acts that display His power and inspire wonder in humans. A miracle is an act of God beyond human understanding that reveals His power, acts as a sign of His work in the world, and inspires awe and wonder. The Greek word for miracle, "dunamis," means power, emphasizing that miracles are a display of God's supernatural power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Miracles as Signs, Wonders, and Power&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bible uses three main words to describe miracles: signs, wonders, and power. These words help us understand what it means for God to be the God of miracles. A miracle is an extraordinary or unnatural event that reveals or confirms a specific message through a mighty work of God. It is not merely a means of authenticating Himself to people but rather a way for God to reveal Himself to those who have eyes of faith to see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;God's Supernatural Power&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God uses supernatural power to perform miracles and reveal Himself to people on Earth. His miracles often defy or overpower the laws of nature, but He can also work within nature to perform miracles. For example, when God parted the Red Sea, He used a powerful wind. Miracles capture people's attention by their unusual and unnatural nature, inspiring them to seek God and His message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Miracles as Signs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Miracles serve as signs that convey a message or reveal truth. They are not meant to amuse or entertain but rather to glorify God. For example, when Jesus raised Lazarus from the dead, He did so to confirm that He was sent by God and had power over death. Through this miracle, many people put their faith in Christ and believed in Him as the Son of God. Miracles have a purpose beyond the immediate event; they convey a truth or confirm a message from God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Nature and Purpose of Miracles&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The power behind miracles reveals their source: God. The wonder of miracles showcases their awe-inspiring nature and captures our attention. The sign of miracles conveys a specific message or truth. Miracles demonstrate God's absolute control over nature, events, people, and powers. They reveal who God is and awaken humans to His presence and the presence of His Kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0Jd45--hHR4" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The Greatest Miracle: Salvation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God's greatest miracle is the salvation He offers through His Son, Jesus Christ. Jesus, as both fully God and fully man, paid the ultimate price for our sins through His sacrificial death on the cross. By overcoming the power of death through His resurrection, Jesus accomplished the miracle of salvation. This miracle demonstrates God's love for humanity and provides a way for us to be reconciled with Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding God as the God of miracles is essential for deepening our faith and relationship with Him. Recognizing that God has the power to perform miracles helps us trust in His providence and sovereignty over all things. Miracles remind us that God is actively at work in the world, revealing Himself to those who have eyes to see. They also affirm the truth of God's Word and confirm His message. Ultimately, recognizing God as the God of miracles strengthens our faith and encourages us to seek a deeper understanding of His character and purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Think About It&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reflect on a time when you witnessed or experienced a miracle in your life or someone else's life. How did it impact your faith?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consider how miracles can serve as signs that convey a specific message or truth from God. How can we discern the message behind a miracle?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Explore examples of miracles in the Bible and reflect on their purpose and significance. How do these miracles shape your understanding of God's power and character?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consider the miracle of salvation through Jesus Christ. How does this miracle impact your relationship with God and your understanding of His love for humanity?&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many people have questioned whether God is evil, and there are various arguments presented to support this claim.

While their …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Is God Evil?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many people have questioned whether God is evil, and there are various arguments presented to support this claim. One website, evilbible.com, attempts to demonstrate that the Bible is not the Word of God and that the God of Christianity is not worthy of worship. While their arguments may seem compelling at first glance, a closer examination reveals that they are based on misunderstandings of God's Word, character, and creation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Misunderstanding of God's Word&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evilbible.com asserts that the Bible is full of atrocities and contradictions, which they use to argue against its divine inspiration. While it is true that the Bible records many terrible things, such as the brutal rape and murder of a woman in Judges 19, it is important to understand that the Bible does not endorse or commend these actions. The Bible simply records historical events, including the sinful actions of humanity. Evilbible.com fails to recognize this distinction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another example they bring up is the command for Abraham to sacrifice his son Isaac. They argue that this proves God is not loving and good. However, they misunderstand the narrative. God never intended for Abraham to actually sacrifice his son; it was a test of faith. The story foreshadows God sacrificing His own Son Jesus for the sins of humanity. Evilbible.com's argument falls apart when one understands the true meaning behind this event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding supposed contradictions in the Bible, evilbible.com lists several examples to suggest that it is not inerrant. However, many of these alleged contradictions have been thoroughly discussed and addressed by biblical scholars. It is important to note that the Bible is a spiritual book with deeper meanings beyond literal interpretation. For example, &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Leviticus/19/Leviticus-19-19.html"&gt;Leviticus 19:19&lt;/a&gt; prohibits mixing different kinds of animals, seeds, and materials. Critics may mock this as a prohibition against wearing wool and polyester blends, but it actually symbolizes Israel's need to remain devoted to God and not assimilate pagan teachings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary, evilbible.com's claims of atrocities and contradictions in the Bible do not hold up under closer scrutiny. The Bible records historical events without endorsing them, and many supposed contradictions can be explained through a deeper understanding of spiritual lessons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Misunderstanding of God's Character&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evilbible.com portrays God as a tyrant and murderer, but this perspective is based on a misunderstanding of history and God's character. They argue that God's judgment on various cultures and peoples was unjust. However, they overlook the historical evidence that these nations practiced wickedness and atrocities. For example, the Assyrians were known for their brutal and cruel acts, such as impaling victims on sharp poles and making handbags from their skins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evilbible.com also claims that God is the creator of evil, citing &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/45/Isaiah-45-7.html"&gt;Isaiah 45:7&lt;/a&gt;. However, this verse has been misunderstood due to a poor translation in the King James Version. The correct interpretation is that God brings calamity and disaster as consequences for those who oppose Him, not moral evil. God is a just and righteous deity who punishes those who persist in wickedness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to recognize that evilbible.com invokes a Christian moral framework to criticize God, which is intellectually inconsistent for atheists. Without a belief in God, there can be no objective basis for morality. Atheists like Richard Dawkins acknowledge this limitation and argue that life has no higher purpose or meaning. Therefore, evilbible.com lacks a moral foundation to make claims about good and evil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, evilbible.com's portrayal of God as a tyrant and creator of evil is based on misunderstandings of history, biblical interpretation, and the foundation of morality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Misunderstanding of God's Creation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evilbible.com borrows from a Christian moral worldview to argue against God, which is irrational and disingenuous. They claim that creation itself refutes the existence of the God described in the Bible. However, they fail to provide an explanation for how an impersonal, amoral, purposeless universe could produce personal beings with a concern for morality and meaning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XBIXPr6AH4A" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The existence of evil is often used as an argument against God, but it can be understood within the framework of free will. Evilbible.com rejects this argument and fails to recognize that moral evil arises from the misuse of freedom. The crucifixion of Jesus, which appeared to be gratuitous evil, ultimately led to redemption for humanity. God's gift of freedom allows for moral choices and their consequences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evilbible.com also argues that God's nature contradicts the world we observe. However, the characteristics of the Judeo-Christian God align with what we can infer from creation itself. He is supernatural, powerful, eternal, omnipresent, timeless, immaterial, personal, necessary, infinite, diverse yet unified, intelligent, purposeful, moral, and caring. This profile matches the God described in the Bible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, evilbible.com's arguments against God's existence based on creation overlook the rationality and consistency of a divine Creator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question of whether God is evil is crucial because it shapes our understanding of who God is and how we relate to Him. Misunderstandings can lead to distorted views of God's character and hinder our ability to experience His love and grace. It is important to approach these questions with open hearts and minds while seeking a deeper understanding of God's Word.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Think About It&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does your perception of God's character influence your relationship with Him?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are there any areas in your understanding of God where you may have misconceptions or misunderstandings?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can a deeper understanding of God's Word help address questions or doubts you may have about His character?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reflect on the moral framework you hold. Where do you believe it originates from, and how does it affect your understanding of good and evil?&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;God's love for humanity is a profound and complex topic that has been contemplated for centuries. While it is impossible for us as humans to fully comprehend the depths of God's love, one thing is certain: God's love is not based on our loveliness or our deserving nature. In fact, it is quite the opposite. The state of humanity since the fall has been marked by rebellion and disobedience. Our hearts are deceitful and desperately wicked, making it impossible for us to seek, love, or desire God (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Jeremiah/17/Jeremiah-17-9.html"&gt;Jeremiah 17:9&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/3/Romans-3-10.html"&gt;Romans 3:10-12&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1. God's Essential Nature as Love&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bible tells us that "God is love" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-John/4/1-John-4-8.html"&gt;1 John 4:8&lt;/a&gt;, 16). This declaration is of utmost importance - it means that love is not just something God does, but it is an essential aspect of His being. Love permeates God's nature and infuses all His other attributes, including His wrath and anger. God's love is not a sappy, sentimental feeling; it is sacrificial and selfless (agape love). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think about it: Just as a fire radiates warmth and light, so does God radiate love because it is inherent to His nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2. God's Demonstration of Love&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because God's nature is love, He must demonstrate it to bring glory to Himself. Glorifying God is the highest and noblest act, and since He deserves all glory, He must demonstrate all His attributes. One powerful way in which God demonstrates His love is through the sacrificial act of sending His Son, Jesus Christ, to pay the penalty for our sins (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-John/4/1-John-4-10.html"&gt;1 John 4:10&lt;/a&gt;). This act reveals the extent of His love for us while we were still sinners (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/5/Romans-5-8.html"&gt;Romans 5:8&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why this matters: God's demonstration of love through the sacrifice of Jesus Christ is what sets Christianity apart from other religions. It reveals the depth of God's personal and sacrificial love for each individual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;3. God's Personal and Unconditional Love&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QPywCD-TSd0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;God's love is not impersonal; it is deeply personal. He knows each one of us individually and loves us personally. His love has no beginning and no end. Despite our rebellion and sinfulness, God's love remains steadfast and unchanging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think about it: Imagine a loving parent who deeply cares for their child, despite the child's mistakes and shortcomings. In the same way, God's love for us is unconditional and unwavering, even in our brokenness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;4. God's Love as a Transforming Power&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God's love has the power to transform us from within. When we accept His love and surrender our lives to Him, He forgives us of our rebellion against Him and sends His Holy Spirit to dwell within us. This indwelling Spirit enables us to love others as He loves us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why this matters: Experiencing God's love and allowing it to transform us is at the core of the Christian faith. It empowers us to extend that same sacrificial love to others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;5. Understanding Love in Light of God's Holiness&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God's holiness also plays a crucial role in understanding His love. His holiness demands justice for sin, but His love provides a way for forgiveness and reconciliation. This is seen in Jesus' sacrificial death on the cross, where God's justice was satisfied, and His love was poured out for humanity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think about it: Imagine a courtroom where a guilty person stands before a judge. The judge, who is both just and loving, imposes a just penalty but also offers to pay it on behalf of the guilty person. This exemplifies how God's holiness and love intersect in the person of Jesus Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;6. Responding to God's Love&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God's love is not meant to be merely acknowledged; it calls for a response. When we truly grasp the depth of His love, we are compelled to respond by loving Him in return and loving others as He loves us. This response includes obedience to His commandments, seeking a personal relationship with Him, and living a life that reflects His love and character.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why this matters: Understanding and responding to God's love transforms our lives and enables us to experience the abundant life He desires for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, while we may never fully comprehend the depths of God's love, we can be assured that it is personal, sacrificial, and unconditional. God's essential nature as love compels Him to demonstrate His love for us through the sacrifice of Jesus Christ. This sacrificial act reveals the extent of His love, providing a way for forgiveness and transformation. Understanding and responding to God's love is at the heart of the Christian faith, enabling us to experience His abundant life and share His love with others.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/God's Relationship to Us/He Cares For Us"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Unveiling the Truth: Does God Allow Deception?</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/god-allow-deception/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-07-17T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-07-17T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-07-17:/god-allow-deception/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;God's Allowance of Deception&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deception is a concept that is deeply intertwined with the spiritual realm. The Bible reveals that Satan, known as the "father of lies," actively deceives those who are in need of accepting the truth (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/8/John-8-44.html"&gt;John 8:44&lt;/a&gt;). At first glance, it may seem perplexing that God …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;God's Allowance of Deception&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deception is a concept that is deeply intertwined with the spiritual realm. The Bible reveals that Satan, known as the "father of lies," actively deceives those who are in need of accepting the truth (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/8/John-8-44.html"&gt;John 8:44&lt;/a&gt;). At first glance, it may seem perplexing that God allows deception to occur when His desire is for all people to repent and be saved (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/2-Peter/3/2-Peter-3-9.html"&gt;2 Peter 3:9&lt;/a&gt;). However, a closer examination of scripture provides insights into the relationship between sin, deception, and humanity's capacity to choose. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Deeper Nature of Deception&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we think of deception, we often view it as being tricked or lied to. However, in a spiritual context, deception goes beyond surface-level manipulation. It involves our choices and what we willingly choose to believe, even when faced with evidence to the contrary (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/16/Luke-16-31.html"&gt;Luke 16:31&lt;/a&gt;). This means that intelligence, philosophical ability, or wisdom are not prerequisites for salvation (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Galatians/3/Galatians-3-28.html"&gt;Galatians 3:28&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-Corinthians/1/1-Corinthians-1-20.html"&gt;1 Corinthians 1:20&lt;/a&gt;, 26). In fact, throughout history, humans have often used knowledge to develop more sophisticated ways to sin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Eve's Fall and Spiritual Deception&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z6NC_kA3NHQ" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To understand the nature of spiritual deception, we can look at the example of Eve in the Garden of Eden. When the serpent asked Eve if God had really said they couldn't eat from a certain tree, Eve responded by quoting God's command but added her own interpretation (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/3/Genesis-3-1.html"&gt;Genesis 3:1-3&lt;/a&gt;). Despite knowing what was right, she chose to entertain the serpent's temptations and desires for personal gain (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/3/Genesis-3-4.html"&gt;Genesis 3:4-6&lt;/a&gt;). Eve was deceived by the serpent's cunningness (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/2-Corinthians/11/2-Corinthians-11-3.html"&gt;2 Corinthians 11:3&lt;/a&gt;), but ultimately, she exercised her free will to make a wrong choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even today, Satan appeals to our natural desires and urges us to fulfill them in ways that dishonor God. Our longing for self-satisfaction makes Satan's deception all the more potent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Rejecting Apparent Truth and Spiritual Deception&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God has made Himself known through various means, including the sending of His Son, the signs of His existence in the world, and His availability to those who seek Him (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/3/John-3-16.html"&gt;John 3:16&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/1/Romans-1-20.html"&gt;Romans 1:20&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Deuteronomy/4/Deuteronomy-4-29.html"&gt;Deuteronomy 4:29&lt;/a&gt;). However, when people reject what is clearly seen of God, it leads to a downward spiral of spiritual deception. This rejection creates a void that will be filled by something less than true. The unbeliever exchanges the truth for a lie, and Satan is ready to offer a wide array of lies to choose from (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/1/Romans-1-25.html"&gt;Romans 1:25&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Resisting God and falling into spiritual deception is a risk that anyone takes when they reject the truth (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/2-Thessalonians/2/2-Thessalonians-2-8.html"&gt;2 Thessalonians 2:8-10&lt;/a&gt;). When we reject spiritual truth, we open ourselves up to believing anything. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Human Choice and Spiritual Deception&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to understand that all human sin is based on individual choice (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-Corinthians/10/1-Corinthians-10-13.html"&gt;1 Corinthians 10:13&lt;/a&gt;). When we reject truth, we make ourselves vulnerable to deception. Repeated rejection of spiritual truth brings about spiritual deception as a divine consequence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eve's sin was not solely due to being overpowered by a demonic force, but rather her choice to listen to the lie presented to her. She allowed her desires for a better life and personal gain to influence her decision-making process. In the same way, our choices are pivotal in determining whether we succumb to spiritual deception or remain rooted in God's truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding why God allows deception provides us with valuable insights into the human condition and our relationship with Him. It highlights the importance of actively seeking and embracing the truth while being aware of the potential for deception. By recognizing our vulnerability to deception, we can guard ourselves against the lies of the enemy and make choices that align with God's will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Think About It&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does understanding the nature of spiritual deception impact your view of personal responsibility in making choices?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In what ways can you actively guard yourself against spiritual deception and ensure that you are rooted in God's truth?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reflect on instances in your life where you may have been deceived by the enemy's lies. How could a deeper understanding of spiritual deception help you avoid similar situations in the future?&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every day, all around the world, there are individuals who mock God. They go to great lengths to blaspheme, ridicule, and challenge their Creator. This audacious display of mockery can be disheartening and raises questions about why God allows it to continue. In order to understand this, we must delve into the concept of free will and its role in our relationship with God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1. Free Will: A Gift from God&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God created mankind with the precious gift of free will. As stated in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Revelation/4/Revelation-4-11.html"&gt;Revelation 4:11&lt;/a&gt;, "Thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive glory and honor and power: for thou hast created all things, and for thy pleasure they are and were created" (KJV). In creating us with free will, God desired a genuine relationship with His children, rather than mindless servants. Just as human parents desire a loving relationship with their children, God wanted fellowship with us – thinking individuals with our own quirks and personalities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding that free will is a gift from God helps us appreciate the depth of His love for us. It shows that He desires our voluntary love and worship, rather than mere obedience. This knowledge encourages us to make intentional choices that align with His will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2. The Consequence of Free Will&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With free will comes the ability to choose between good and evil, right and wrong. Unfortunately, this also means that individuals have the freedom to disobey, blaspheme, or even mock God. &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Galatians/6/Galatians-6-7.html"&gt;Galatians 6:7&lt;/a&gt; warns us that God will not be mocked forever. While mockery may seem temporary, there will come a day of reckoning when individuals reap what they have sown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recognizing the consequences of our actions helps us understand the seriousness of mocking God. It challenges us to reflect on our choices and consider the impact they may have on our relationship with Him. It also reminds us that there is accountability for our actions, both in this life and in eternity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;3. The Solution: Restoring the Relationship&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite our ability to mock God, He has provided a solution for our broken relationship with Him. Through the sacrifice of Jesus Christ on the cross, we have the means to restore a loving relationship with God. This act of ultimate love offers forgiveness and redemption to those who believe in Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_eGuEloeetM" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Understanding the solution God has provided through Jesus Christ gives us hope and reassurance. It shows that despite our shortcomings and failures, we can experience restoration and forgiveness through faith. It reminds us of the depth of God's love and His desire for reconciliation with His creation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider how your understanding of free will impacts your relationship with God. Does it encourage you to seek a genuine, voluntary relationship with Him? How does knowing that God will not be mocked forever affect your choices and actions?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;4. The Purpose of Mockery: A Test of Faith&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While mockery may appear disheartening, it serves as a test of faith. Just as trials refine our character, mockery challenges us to strengthen our belief in God even in the face of opposition. It reveals the depth of our commitment to Him and allows us to grow spiritually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recognizing the purpose behind mockery helps us navigate through challenging times. It encourages us to hold firm to our faith and trust in God's sovereignty, even when faced with ridicule. It reminds us that our response to mockery can serve as a testimony of our unwavering devotion to Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;5. Responding to Mockery: Grace and Love&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the face of mockery, Christians are called to respond with grace and love. Jesus taught us to love our enemies and pray for those who persecute us (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/5/Matthew-5-44.html"&gt;Matthew 5:44&lt;/a&gt;). By responding with kindness and compassion, we demonstrate the transformative power of God's love and His ability to change hearts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Responding to mockery with grace and love sets us apart as followers of Christ. It reflects His character and can have a profound impact on those who witness our response. It presents an opportunity to showcase the love of God and potentially lead others to a relationship with Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider a time when you faced mockery or ridicule for your faith. How did you respond? Did your response reflect the love and grace of Christ? How could you grow in responding to mockery with kindness and compassion?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;6. The Final Judgment: God's Justice Prevails&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it may seem that mockery goes unpunished, there will come a day when God's justice prevails. The Bible assures us that every individual will be held accountable for their actions, including their mockery of God. On that day, the true nature of every person's heart will be revealed, and God's justice will be fully realized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The promise of God's ultimate justice provides comfort and reassurance. It reminds us that even in the face of apparent injustice, God sees all and will bring about justice in His perfect timing. It encourages us to trust in His sovereignty and find peace in knowing that He is in control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mocking God is a reality that we must grapple with in a world where free will exists. However, understanding the purpose of free will helps us appreciate the depth of God's love for us and the desire for a genuine relationship with His children. While mockery may seem disheartening, we can find hope in the solution provided through Jesus Christ, which offers forgiveness and restoration. Responding to mockery with grace and love showcases the transformative power of God's love and sets us apart as followers of Christ. Ultimately, we can find reassurance in the promise of God's justice, knowing that He sees all and will bring about judgment in due time.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/God's Relationship to Us/Toward All People"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Bless God: 5 Powerful Ways to Deepen Your Spiritual Connection</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/bless-god/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-07-16T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-07-16T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-07-16:/bless-god/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Blessing God: Understanding the Meaning and Importance&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The act of blessing God is mentioned primarily in the Old Testament, particularly in the Psalms. While the King James Version uses the phrase "bless the Lord," modern translations often render it as "praise the Lord." So what does it mean for us to bless God? Let's explore this concept and understand its significance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What Does It Mean to Bless God?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hebrew word translated as "bless" or "praise" means literally "to kneel." Therefore, to bless the Lord means to praise Him, exalt Him, and worship Him. It is an act of kneeling in worship before our Creator. The Psalms beautifully express blessings upon God for His counsel, holiness, dominion over all things, honor, and majesty. When we bless God, we offer Him our praise and blessings because He deserves them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Purpose of Blessing God&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God is glorified when we bless and praise Him. Our acknowledgment of Him through praise, adoration, thanksgiving, and love fulfills the purpose for which we were created. However, it is important to note that we can only truly bless God when we are in a right relationship with Him. &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Proverbs/28/Proverbs-28-9.html"&gt;Proverbs 28:9&lt;/a&gt; warns that if anyone turns a deaf ear to the Law, even their prayers are detestable. Therefore, it is only once we have been blessed by God in the heavenly realms that we can bless God in return in a way that pleases Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the meaning of blessing God allows us to engage in true worship. It helps us shift our focus from ourselves and our desires to acknowledge and glorify our Creator. When we bless God, we align ourselves with His will and purpose for our lives. It deepens our relationship with Him and brings us into a closer communion with His Spirit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider your own approach to worship. Do you see it as a means to receive blessings from God, or do you approach it with a heart of gratitude and adoration, seeking to bless Him? Take time to reflect on the Psalms and the examples of blessing God found within them. How can you incorporate these expressions of praise and worship into your own life?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Blessing God: A Deeper Understanding&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To gain a deeper understanding of the concept of blessing God, let's delve into some key points and explore them further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1. Blessing God as Praise and Worship&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The act of blessing God is closely intertwined with praise and worship. When we bless God, we are acknowledging His greatness, His attributes, and His dominion over all things. Just as we offer our prayers and supplications to Him, we also offer our praises and blessings. This act of worship allows us to enter into His presence and magnify His name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2. Blessing God for His Attributes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Psalms are filled with blessings upon God for various aspects of His character and nature. We bless Him for His counsel, which provides wisdom and guidance in our lives. We bless Him for His holiness, recognizing His perfect purity and righteousness. We bless Him for His dominion over all things, acknowledging His sovereignty and control. And we bless Him for His honor and majesty, praising Him for His glorious splendor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blessing God in this way helps us cultivate a heart of gratitude and humility. It reminds us that He is the source of all blessings and that everything we have comes from Him. By recognizing His attributes and giving Him the honor He deserves, we grow in our understanding of who He is and deepen our relationship with Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gK0fbhGdX4A" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take a moment to consider the specific attributes of God that you are grateful for in your own life. How can you express your blessings and praise for these attributes in your worship? Consider incorporating them into your prayers, songs, or even journaling as a way to bless God for who He is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Significance of Blessing God&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blessing God is not just an act of obedience; it holds great significance in our relationship with Him. Let's explore some key reasons why blessing God matters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1. Honoring God as Our Creator&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we bless God, we acknowledge Him as our Creator. We recognize that He is the one who formed us and breathed life into us. By offering our blessings and praise, we honor Him as the source of our existence and everything good in our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2. Glorifying God&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blessing God brings glory to His name. When we exalt Him and magnify His attributes, we reflect His greatness to the world around us. Our worship becomes a testimony of His goodness, mercy, and power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;3. Shifting Our Focus&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blessing God helps us shift our focus from ourselves and our desires to Him and His will. It reminds us that life is not solely about what we can receive from God but also about honoring and serving Him. By blessing God, we align ourselves with His purpose for our lives and seek to bring Him joy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the significance of blessing God helps us cultivate a lifestyle of worship. It encourages us to make praising and honoring Him a central part of our daily lives. As we continually bless God, we grow in our love for Him and become more aware of His presence in every aspect of our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider how often you intentionally bless God throughout your day. Are your thoughts, words, and actions focused on magnifying His name? Take time each day to deliberately bless God for who He is and what He has done in your life. This intentional act of worship will deepen your relationship with Him and bring you into a closer communion with His Spirit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blessing God is an act of worship and praise. It involves acknowledging and honoring Him for His attributes, dominion, and wisdom. When we bless God, we shift our focus from ourselves to Him, deepening our relationship with Him and glorifying His name. By understanding the meaning and significance of blessing God, we can cultivate a lifestyle of worship and draw nearer to our Heavenly Father.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let us take time to bless God today, offering our praise, adoration, thanksgiving, and love to the One who deserves it all. May our lives be filled with the joy of blessing our Creator and experiencing the richness of His presence.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/Our Response to God/Worshiping God"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Unlocking the Divine Promise: God of Abraham, Isaac &amp; Jacob Revealed</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/god-of-abraham-isaac-jacob/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-07-16T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-07-16T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-07-16:/god-of-abraham-isaac-jacob/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Bible refers to the Lord God as the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in several places. This name emphasizes the covenant that God made with Israel and their special place as God's chosen people. The Abrahamic Covenant was repeated to three different generations: Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. All three were given the promise of land, many descendants, and blessing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Covenant with Abraham&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Lord called Abram out of Ur of the Chaldees to the land of Canaan and established a covenant with him (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/12/Genesis-12-1.html"&gt;Genesis 12:1&lt;/a&gt;–3). This covenant included promises of land, descendants as numerous as the stars, and blessing for all nations through his descendants. God reaffirmed this covenant with Abraham's son, Isaac (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/21/Genesis-21-12.html"&gt;Genesis 21:12&lt;/a&gt;; 26:3–4), and later with Isaac's son, Jacob (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/28/Genesis-28-14.html"&gt;Genesis 28:14&lt;/a&gt;–15). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fS2GQQgzM6k" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When God revealed Himself to Moses in preparation for bringing His people out of Egypt, He identified Himself as "the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob" in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Exodus/3/Exodus-3-15.html"&gt;Exodus 3:15&lt;/a&gt;. This name carries important implications. First, it distinguishes the Lord from the gods of Egypt, highlighting that He is the one true God. Second, it reminds the Israelites of the promise of land given to their forefathers. The faithfulness of God and the blessings upon Israel were directly tied to their possession of the Promised Land.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Resurrection and the God of the Living&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus alluded to God's appearance to Moses at the burning bush when He taught about the resurrection to the Sadducees. He said, "I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/22/Matthew-22-31.html"&gt;Matthew 22:31&lt;/a&gt;–32). Jesus pointed out that these patriarchs were still alive in heaven, as God's verb usage indicates that He is their present God. This teaching emphasizes the reality of the resurrection and the eternal life that believers will experience in God's presence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The God of our Fathers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Acts 3, Peter preaches to the Jews in the temple, referring to the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. He attributes the miracle of a lame man walking to the power of this God working through Jesus. Peter emphasizes that this same God who spoke to the patriarchs is at work in their midst. However, he also highlights a contrast—the Jews handed Jesus over to be killed, despite His divine nature. Peter reminds his hearers that they are heirs of the prophets and of the covenant God made with their fathers, emphasizing the continuity between their faith and the promises given to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Plan for Redemption&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob has a plan for the ages that involves a Savior who provides forgiveness of sins and reconciliation with God. This plan was set in motion when God called Abram and blessed him. It reached its fulfillment in Jesus' death and resurrection. Through the seed of Abraham, all nations are blessed by the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding God as the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob helps us grasp His faithfulness to His promises. It reveals His plan for redemption throughout history and highlights the importance of Jesus as the fulfillment of that plan. Recognizing our connection to God's covenant with Israel deepens our appreciation for our own spiritual inheritance as believers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider how knowing that God is the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob affects your understanding of His character and purposes. Reflect on how this knowledge strengthens your confidence in His faithfulness and love for His people.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/The Identity of God/The Titles of God"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Unveiling God''s Perfect Will: A Christian''s Guide to Divine Guidance</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/gods-perfect-will/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-07-16T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-07-16T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-07-16:/gods-perfect-will/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;God's Perfect Will&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to understanding God's perfect will for our lives, many of us seek specific guidance from Him.

However, God reveals a different approach to determining His …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;God's Perfect Will&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to understanding God's perfect will for our lives, many of us seek specific guidance from Him. We want to know where to work, where to live, whom to marry, and even what car to buy. However, God reveals a different approach to determining His perfect will. While He does have specific plans for each person, His perfect will is the same for all. It includes His desire for everyone to be saved and come to a knowledge of the truth (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-Timothy/2/1-Timothy-2-3.html"&gt;1 Timothy 2:3&lt;/a&gt;–4). It also involves living a sanctified life, avoiding sexual immorality, learning self-control, and doing good as a result of our faith (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-Thessalonians/4/1-Thessalonians-4-3.html"&gt;1 Thessalonians 4:3&lt;/a&gt;–5; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-Peter/2/1-Peter-2-15.html"&gt;1 Peter 2:15&lt;/a&gt;–16). Additionally, giving thanks in all circumstances is part of God's perfect will for us (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-Thessalonians/5/1-Thessalonians-5-18.html"&gt;1 Thessalonians 5:18&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Confession and Seeking Forgiveness&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To align ourselves with God's perfect will, we must start by confessing any known sins. We can trust that God is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-John/1/1-John-1-9.html"&gt;1 John 1:9&lt;/a&gt;). Additionally, we should ask God to search our hearts and reveal any offensive ways within us (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/139/Psalm-139-23.html"&gt;Psalm 139:23&lt;/a&gt;–24). This introspection helps us identify areas where we may have strayed from God's will and need His forgiveness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Seeking Forgiveness and Restitution&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If our actions involved sinning against someone else, it is crucial that we seek their forgiveness and make amends. Zacchaeus is an example of repentance and restitution when he promised to repay four times the amount he cheated from others (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/19/Luke-19-8.html"&gt;Luke 19:8&lt;/a&gt;). This act of seeking forgiveness and making restitution demonstrates a "fruit in keeping with repentance" as preached by John the Baptist (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/3/Luke-3-9.html"&gt;Luke 3:9&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Glorifying God in All We Do&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Returning to the Lord and seeking to glorify Him is an essential aspect of living in alignment with His perfect will. In everything we do, whether in work or daily life, we should strive to bring glory to God (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-Corinthians/10/1-Corinthians-10-31.html"&gt;1 Corinthians 10:31&lt;/a&gt;). By making God the center of our actions and decisions, we can ensure that we are living according to His perfect will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Relying on the Holy Spirit's Guidance&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We cannot live out God's perfect will in our own strength. We must rely on the power of the Holy Spirit who dwells within us. Jesus promised that the Holy Spirit would be our guide and teacher (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/14/John-14-26.html"&gt;John 14:26&lt;/a&gt;; 16:13). With the Spirit's guidance, we can discern God's will and walk in obedience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding that God's perfect will is not solely about specific decisions, such as what car to buy or where to go for lunch, is crucial. While these choices are important, they do not determine whether we are in alignment with God's perfect will. The book of Proverbs reminds us that although we can make plans, it is ultimately the Lord who directs our steps (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Proverbs/16/Proverbs-16-1.html"&gt;Proverbs 16:1&lt;/a&gt;–9). Seeking the Lord, committing our ways to Him, and trusting in His sovereignty allows us to make decisions with humility and obedience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uY8VwyNBM9s" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Missing God's Perfect Will&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While God's perfect will is unchanging and available to all believers, it is possible to miss out on experiencing His best for us due to sinful or unwise decisions. When we make choices that go against God's principles, there may be consequences that affect our lives. Examples from Scripture illustrate how individuals missed God's best due to disobedience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;King Jehoash only partially obeyed God's command and missed out on complete victory over his enemies (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/2-Kings/13/2-Kings-13-18.html"&gt;2 Kings 13:18&lt;/a&gt;–19). Moses struck the rock instead of speaking to it as God commanded, and as a result, he was not allowed to enter the Promised Land (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Numbers/20/Numbers-20-10.html"&gt;Numbers 20:10&lt;/a&gt;–13). King Jehoshaphat allied himself with a wicked king and suffered the loss of his fleet (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/2-Chronicles/20/2-Chronicles-20-35.html"&gt;2 Chronicles 20:35&lt;/a&gt;–37).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we find ourselves in a position where we have missed God's perfect will, we should trust in His forgiveness and do the next right thing. The Bible assures us that even in our failures, "all things work together for good to those who love God, to those who are called according to His purpose" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/8/Romans-8-28.html"&gt;Romans 8:28&lt;/a&gt;). We can still be forgiven and continue to follow the truth, living in obedience to God's will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding God's perfect will helps us navigate life's decisions with clarity and confidence. It reminds us that our ultimate purpose is to glorify God and live in alignment with His principles. By seeking forgiveness, making amends, and relying on the Holy Spirit's guidance, we can continually move closer to God's perfect will for our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you believe that God has a specific plan for your life? How does knowing His desire for all people to be saved and live a sanctified life impact your understanding of His will?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have you experienced the consequences of making ungodly or unwise decisions? How did it affect your perception of being in alignment with God's perfect will?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reflect on how you can more intentionally seek God's will in your daily life. Consider implementing practices such as confession, seeking forgiveness, and relying on the Holy Spirit's guidance.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we ask the question, "How big is God?" we may encounter different answers depending on the context. In children's Sunday school, the common response is that God is "bigger than you can imagine!" While this answer may satisfy the curiosity of young minds, it leaves …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;How Big is God?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we ask the question, "How big is God?" we may encounter different answers depending on the context. In children's Sunday school, the common response is that God is "bigger than you can imagine!" While this answer may satisfy the curiosity of young minds, it leaves us wondering about the nature of God's size in a more philosophical and metaphysical sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to note that God cannot be measured in terms of physical dimensions because He is not made of material substances. He exists outside of our physical world and is preexistent and eternal (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Revelation/22/Revelation-22-13.html"&gt;Revelation 22:13&lt;/a&gt;). God is not a created being but is existence itself. He transcends space and time, and therefore, spatial descriptions do not apply to Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God is described as "spirit" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/4/John-4-24.html"&gt;John 4:24&lt;/a&gt;), which means He does not have a physical or material form. This concept can be challenging for us to grasp since we are accustomed to thinking in terms of length, depth, and height. Our perception of reality is closely tied to the material world, and we often rely on measuring devices and units to understand things better. However, when it comes to measuring God, we face a significant obstacle because He is immaterial and immeasurable. He exists infinitely in every way and cannot be quantified or fully comprehended by human means.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yohdJoWtEKw" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite our limitations in understanding God's vastness, we can find comfort in knowing that He loves us and has revealed Himself through His Word and His Son, Jesus Christ. We are created in His image (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/1/Genesis-1-27.html"&gt;Genesis 1:27&lt;/a&gt;), and His love for us is demonstrated through the sacrifice of Jesus (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/3/John-3-16.html"&gt;John 3:16&lt;/a&gt;). While we may never fully grasp the magnitude of God's being, we can rest assured that He is "big" enough to create the universe and "small" enough to intimately know and love each one of us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the concept of God's size has profound implications for our faith and worldview. It reminds us that God is beyond human comprehension and defies our attempts to fit Him into our limited understanding. Recognizing the immeasurability of God's being prompts us to approach Him with awe, reverence, and humility. It encourages us to seek a deeper relationship with Him, knowing that He is greater than anything we can imagine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does the idea of God's immeasurability challenge your perception of Him?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In what ways can acknowledging God's vastness enhance your worship and devotion?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does the concept of God's infinite nature affect your understanding of His love for you?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Key Points&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;God is not made of material substances, so He has no physical dimensions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;God is preexistent, eternal, and transcends space and time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As a spiritual being, God does not possess a physical or material form.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our tendency to measure and quantify things cannot be applied to God, as He is immaterial and immeasurable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Despite our limitations in understanding God's vastness, He has revealed Himself through His Word and His Son, Jesus Christ.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;God's immeasurable nature invites us to approach Him with reverence and humility while deepening our relationship with Him.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When discussing the "impassibility of God," theologians are considering whether God is capable of feeling or suffering.

&lt;p&gt;When discussing the "impassibility of God," theologians are considering whether God is capable of feeling or suffering. Some argue that God is impassible, meaning He exists above human emotion and remains untouched by it. Others believe that God is passible, meaning He can and does experience emotional pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Attributes of God&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The impassibility of God is often seen as one of His essential attributes. It is considered alongside other attributes such as His immutability (unchanging nature), omniscience (all-knowing), and eternality. Those who argue for impassibility view God as apathetic, in the sense that He does not experience or respond emotionally to the events on earth. On the other hand, those who argue for passibility insist that God does suffer with us and feel emotional pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Avoiding Extremes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both sides of the debate must be careful not to push their arguments to the extreme. When the doctrine of divine impassibility is taken to an extreme, it can result in deism, which portrays God as distant and uninvolved with humanity. Conversely, when the doctrine of divine passibility is taken to an extreme, it can lead to open theism, which suggests that God does not know the future and is surprised by events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AkbKyfjnvm0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Arguments for Impassibility&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Supporters of divine impassibility often base their argument on the concept of God's immutability. They reason that if God suffers in response to pain, then He has changed. They do not deny that God has emotions but assert that His emotions are voluntary and purposeful rather than knee-jerk reactions to earthly events. Additionally, proponents of divine impassibility argue that God's absolute power and sovereignty make it unlikely for Him to suffer since suffering implies being subject to something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Arguments for Passibility&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advocates for divine passibility point to numerous Scripture passages that suggest God does respond emotionally to events on earth. Throughout the Bible, we see God's compassion for His people, His wrath against sin, and His pain in response to rejection. Jesus, who is described as the exact representation of God's being, wept at Lazarus's tomb. He is also portrayed as our Great High Priest who can empathize with our weaknesses. The suffering of Jesus, predicted by the prophets, further supports the concept of God's passibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Sharing in Suffering&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea of passibility is closely related to the concept of believers entering into the suffering of others. Scripture encourages Christians to remember and empathize with those who are suffering, just as Jesus did. By sharing in each other's sorrow, believers reflect the passibility of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;God's Involvement and Care&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Supporters of passibility emphasize that God's eternal divine sympathy drives Him to be involved in His creation and willingly allows His heart to be touched by the suffering of His people. While God is transcendent, He is not aloof. The Bible portrays Him as a passionate God who listens to our cries for help, shows compassion, and understands our suffering firsthand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the impassibility or passibility of God has implications for how we perceive and relate to Him. If God is impassible, we may view Him as distant and unfeeling, leading to a sense of abandonment or isolation during times of struggle. On the other hand, if God is passible, we can find comfort in knowing that He empathizes with our pain and actively participates in our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider how your understanding of God's nature affects your relationship with Him. Do you view Him as distant and uninvolved? Or do you believe that He cares deeply about your struggles and emotions? Reflect on how embracing the concept of God's passibility can deepen your connection with Him and encourage you to share in the suffering of others.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/The Character of God/Emotion"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry></feed>

&lt;h3&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Hebrew, the word "Hashem" means "The Name." It is used as a substitute for the name of God when reading the Torah or praying. This practice stems from the command in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Exodus/20/Exodus-20-7.html"&gt;Exodus 20:7&lt;/a&gt;, which states, "You shall not misuse the name of the …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">maisha_johnson</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 27 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-09-27:/meaning-of-hashem/</guid><category>God/The Identity of God/The Names of God</category><category>null</category></item><item><title>'Why Was Jesus Crucified: Unveiling the Ultimate Sacrifice'</title><link>https://biblebasedliving.com/why-was-jesus-crucified/</link><description>&lt;h2&gt;Why Was Jesus Crucified?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The concept of the Trinity is a fundamental belief in Christianity.

&lt;p&gt;The presence of God is a topic that holds great significance in the Christian faith. In the beginning, Adam and Eve experienced intimate fellowship with God in the Garden of Eden (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/3/Genesis-3-8.html"&gt;Genesis 3:8&lt;/a&gt;). However, sin entered the world and hindered our ability to be in …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;The Presence of God&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The presence of God is a topic that holds great significance in the Christian faith. In the beginning, Adam and Eve experienced intimate fellowship with God in the Garden of Eden (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/3/Genesis-3-8.html"&gt;Genesis 3:8&lt;/a&gt;). However, sin entered the world and hindered our ability to be in the physical presence of God (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Exodus/33/Exodus-33-20.html"&gt;Exodus 33:20&lt;/a&gt;). As a result, only the holy and sinless angels are now in His physical presence (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/1/Luke-1-19.html"&gt;Luke 1:19&lt;/a&gt;). Yet, as Christians, we have the privilege of experiencing the presence of God within us through the indwelling Holy Spirit (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/14/John-14-23.html"&gt;John 14:23&lt;/a&gt;; 15:4). This indwelling presence is made possible through our faith in the Lord Jesus Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Indwelling Presence of God&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/R9qoqQ75ifs" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The presence of God within us is a reality that we become aware of through our obedience to His Word. As believers, we are chosen by God and belong to Him (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-Peter/2/1-Peter-2-9.html"&gt;1 Peter 2:9&lt;/a&gt;). Therefore, it is only natural that He would be present among us. It is important to note that while we may anger God through our sin, true believers never lose the presence of the Holy Spirit. We may, however, lose the "sense" of His presence from time to time. Just as a landlord temporarily leaves his house but leaves his belongings behind, so too does God's presence remain with us even when we feel distant from Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Joy of God's Presence&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The practical result of being in God's presence is joy. Unfortunately, many Christians appear gloomy and dejected due to a lack of this sense of God's presence. However, for those who walk with the Lord in obedience and faith, fellowship with Him is sweet. This sweet fellowship sustains us, especially during trials, for "the joy of the Lord shall be your strength" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Nehemiah/8/Nehemiah-8-10.html"&gt;Nehemiah 8:10&lt;/a&gt;). Trials and difficulties serve to refine our faith and develop perseverance. As we persevere through these challenges, our sense of God's presence increases, along with our joy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the presence of God is essential to our Christian walk. It reminds us that we are not alone but rather have the indwelling Holy Spirit guiding and empowering us. Knowing that God is always present with us can bring comfort and assurance, even in the midst of trials. It also encourages us to seek obedience, trusting that as we do, our sense of His presence will grow, leading to greater joy in our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does knowing that God is always present with you impact your daily life?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have you ever experienced a time when you felt distant from God's presence? How did you regain a sense of His nearness?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reflect on a difficult situation you have faced. Did your sense of God's presence increase or decrease during that time? How did it impact your faith and perseverance?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, the presence of God is a reality that Christians experience through the indwelling Holy Spirit. Though sin has separated us from God's physical presence, we can still enjoy fellowship with Him by walking in obedience and faith. The joy that comes from being in God's presence sustains us through trials and strengthens our faith. Remembering that God is always present with us can bring comfort, assurance, and a greater sense of joy in our lives.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/Our Response to God/Knowing God"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Unveiling the Dangers of Blind Faith in Christianity: A Comprehensive Guide</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/blind-faith/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-09-24T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-09-24T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-09-24:/blind-faith/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Blind Faith: Understanding True Faith in God&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Faith is a concept that holds great significance in Christianity. It is often associated with the idea of "blind faith," which refers to belief without true understanding or discrimination. However, is this the kind of faith that God desires us to have? Does God expect us to have a blind faith? To answer these questions, we will explore the topic of blind faith in the context of biblical teachings and examples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Example of Abraham's Faith&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most prominent examples of faith in the Old Testament is that of Abraham. God made a promise to Abraham that he would become the father of many nations, even though he and his wife Sarah were very old. In their old age, Sarah miraculously gave birth to their son Isaac. Then, God asked Abraham to offer Isaac as a sacrifice (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/22/Genesis-22-1.html"&gt;Genesis 22:1-19&lt;/a&gt;). Astonishingly, Abraham obeyed without questioning God's command. This incident might suggest that God commends blind faith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, if we delve deeper into the biblical account, we find a different perspective on Abraham's faith. In the book of Hebrews, Abraham's faith is described as a reasoned faith. Hebrews 11, often referred to as the hall of fame of faith, mentions Abraham multiple times. In verses 18-19, it states that Abraham "reasoned" that God had promised a great nation through Isaac and believed that even if Isaac were killed, God could raise him from the dead. Abraham's actions were not blind; they were based on reasoning and understanding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Importance of Reason and Understanding&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout Scripture, reason, wisdom, and logic are emphasized as valuable traits. &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Proverbs/3/Proverbs-3-13.html"&gt;Proverbs 3:13&lt;/a&gt; tells us that we are blessed when we gain knowledge and understanding. &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/5/Hebrews-5-12.html"&gt;Hebrews 5:12-14&lt;/a&gt; reproves those who do not seek growth in understanding. The Bereans in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Acts/17/Acts-17-11.html"&gt;Acts 17:11&lt;/a&gt; were commended for their diligent search of the Scriptures to verify the truth of Paul's teachings. The apostle Paul himself often used reason and logical arguments to persuade others of the truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God has given us the ability to think and reason, and He expects us to use this gift. The goal of reason and logic is to find truth, and Jesus, who claimed to be the truth (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/14/John-14-6.html"&gt;John 14:6&lt;/a&gt;), should be the ultimate destination of our reasoning. Therefore, our faith should not be blind; it should be based on knowledge of God's nature, His promises in Scripture, and our personal experience walking with Him every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uwNvdEV9720" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Nurturing a Reasoned Faith&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we are called to have a reasoned faith, there may be times when we have to act purely on faith without having the complete picture, just as Abraham did. However, even in such situations, our faith is not blind but based on what we know about God and His character. Abraham's faith was rooted in his lifetime of walking with God and experiencing His faithfulness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To nurture a reasoned faith, we can engage in various practices. First and foremost, studying the Scriptures is essential. By immersing ourselves in God's Word, we gain a deeper understanding of His nature and His promises. We can also seek wisdom through prayer, asking God for insight and understanding (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/James/1/James-1-5.html"&gt;James 1:5&lt;/a&gt;). Additionally, engaging in conversations with fellow believers and learning from their experiences can help us grow in our faith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the nature of faith is crucial because it shapes our relationship with God. If we view faith as blind belief without understanding, we may struggle to reconcile our doubts and questions with our desire to follow God. However, by embracing a reasoned faith, we can find assurance in knowing that God wants us to use our minds and hearts to seek Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reasoned faith also helps us navigate challenges and trials. When we encounter difficulties, our understanding of God's character and promises can provide us with the strength and hope to persevere. It allows us to approach God with confidence, knowing that He is faithful and trustworthy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How do you define faith? Does the concept of "blind faith" align with your understanding of faith?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reflect on Abraham's example of faith. How can you apply the principles of reasoned faith to your own life?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consider the role of reason and understanding in your relationship with God. How can you cultivate a deeper understanding of His nature and promises?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, blind faith is not the kind of faith that God desires from us. Instead, God calls us to have a reasoned faith based on our knowledge and understanding of Him. While there may be times when we have to act purely on faith without complete understanding, our faith is grounded in what we know about God's character, His promises in Scripture, and our personal experiences walking with Him. By embracing a reasoned faith, we can deepen our relationship with God and find strength in difficult times.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/Our Response to God/Seeking God"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Finding Peace: Overcoming Anger with God Through Faith</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/angry-with-god/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-09-03T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-09-03T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-09-03:/angry-with-god/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Angry with God&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When something tragic happens in our lives, it is natural for us to ask God, "Why?" We may find ourselves angry with God, questioning why He allowed the tragedy to occur. This anger stems from two flawed ways of thinking. First, we may believe that life should be easy and that God should prevent unpleasant circumstances from happening to us. When He doesn't, we get angry with Him. Second, when we don't fully comprehend God's sovereignty, we lose confidence in His ability to control everything, including the events that impact our lives. This lack of understanding can lead to frustration and anger toward God. However, it's important to remember that our anger at God is often rooted in our own human limitations and desire for control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tragedies serve as a reminder that we are not in control. As much as we may try to influence outcomes, it is ultimately God who is in charge of His creation. Every event that occurs is either caused or allowed by God. Even the smallest details do not escape His notice (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/10/Matthew-10-29.html"&gt;Matthew 10:29-31&lt;/a&gt;). While we may complain and get angry, blaming God for our circumstances, it is important to trust Him and surrender our bitterness and pain to Him. Acknowledging our own prideful desire to impose our will over His can grant us His peace and strength to navigate through difficult situations (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-Corinthians/10/1-Corinthians-10-13.html"&gt;1 Corinthians 10:13&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sxJYjF0zLhU" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our understanding of God's sovereignty must be accompanied by an understanding of His other attributes such as love, mercy, kindness, goodness, righteousness, justice, and holiness. When we view our difficulties through the lens of God's Word, we begin to see them in a different light. Scripture assures us that our loving and holy God works all things together for our good (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/8/Romans-8-28.html"&gt;Romans 8:28&lt;/a&gt;). He has a perfect plan and purpose for us that cannot be thwarted (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/14/Isaiah-14-24.html"&gt;Isaiah 14:24&lt;/a&gt;, 46:9-10). It is essential to recognize that this life is not meant to be devoid of trouble. Job reminds us that "man is born to trouble as surely as sparks fly upward" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Job/5/Job-5-7.html"&gt;Job 5:7&lt;/a&gt;), and that life is short and "full of trouble" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Job/14/Job-14-1.html"&gt;Job 14:1&lt;/a&gt;). Following Christ does not guarantee a life free from problems. In fact, Jesus Himself said, "In this world you will have trouble," but He also reassured us that He has "overcome the world" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/16/John-16-33.html"&gt;John 16:33&lt;/a&gt;). Through Him, we can find peace amidst the storms of life (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/14/John-14-27.html"&gt;John 14:27&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to note that inappropriate anger is sinful (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Galatians/5/Galatians-5-20.html"&gt;Galatians 5:20&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Ephesians/4/Ephesians-4-26.html"&gt;Ephesians 4:26-27&lt;/a&gt;, 31; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Colossians/3/Colossians-3-8.html"&gt;Colossians 3:8&lt;/a&gt;). Ungodly anger can be self-destructive, give the devil a foothold in our lives, and rob us of joy and peace. Holding onto anger can breed bitterness and resentment in our hearts. Instead, we must confess our anger to the Lord and release it to Him. It is crucial to approach God in prayer during times of grief, anger, and pain. David serves as an example in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/2-Samuel/12/2-Samuel-12-15.html"&gt;2 Samuel 12:15-23&lt;/a&gt; when he fervently prayed for his sick baby's survival. Even when the baby passed away, David worshiped the Lord and proclaimed that he would someday be reunited with his child in God's presence. David cried out to God during his baby's illness and worshiped Him afterward. This demonstrates the importance of pouring out our hearts to God and being honest about our feelings. He knows our hearts, so there is no need to hide anything from Him. By expressing ourselves humbly before Him, we allow Him to work through us and shape us into His likeness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, we must ask ourselves if we can trust God with everything, including our lives and the lives of our loved ones. The answer is a resounding yes! Our God is compassionate, full of grace and love. As disciples of Christ, we can trust Him with all things. When tragedies occur, we can trust that God can use them to draw us closer to Him and strengthen our faith, leading us to maturity and completeness (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/34/Psalm-34-18.html"&gt;Psalm 34:18&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/James/1/James-1-2.html"&gt;James 1:2-4&lt;/a&gt;). Through our experiences, we can become a testimony of comfort to others (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/2-Corinthians/1/2-Corinthians-1-3.html"&gt;2 Corinthians 1:3-5&lt;/a&gt;). However, this is not an easy process. It requires daily surrendering of our own will to His, faithful study of His attributes as revealed in His Word, consistent prayer, and practical application of what we learn to our own situations. By doing so, our faith will gradually grow and mature, equipping us to trust Him through future tragedies that are sure to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary, it is important to recognize that being angry with God is not justified. Anger at God often stems from an inability or unwillingness to trust Him even when we don't understand His ways. Instead of directing our anger towards God, we should pour out our hearts to Him in prayer and trust that He is in control of His perfect plan.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/Our Response to God/Honest Questions"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Essential Faith: Understanding God's Requirement for Believers</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/god-require-faith/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-08-24T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-08-24T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-08-24:/god-require-faith/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;God Requires Faith&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our relationship with God, just like our relationships with others, requires faith. Faith is an integral component of all relationships because we can never fully know another person. We cannot experience everything they experience or fully understand their thoughts and emotions. In the book of Proverbs, it …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;God Requires Faith&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our relationship with God, just like our relationships with others, requires faith. Faith is an integral component of all relationships because we can never fully know another person. We cannot experience everything they experience or fully understand their thoughts and emotions. In the book of Proverbs, it says, "The heart knows its own bitterness, and a stranger does not share its joy" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Proverbs/14/Proverbs-14-10.html"&gt;Proverbs 14:10&lt;/a&gt;). Even our own hearts can be deceptive and wicked, making it difficult for us to fully know ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we cannot fully know other finite human beings, how can we expect to fully know an infinite God? Even if God desired to fully reveal Himself to us, it would be impossible for us to comprehend Him completely. It would be like trying to pour the vastness of the ocean into a small measuring jar. However, God has revealed enough about Himself through His creation, the Bible, and His Son, Jesus Christ, that we can enter into a meaningful relationship with Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To have a relationship with God, we need to trust in Jesus Christ as the payment for our sins. Sin creates a barrier between a holy God and sinful humanity. Jesus, the sinless Son of God, died on the cross to take our punishment and bridge the gap between us and God. By believing in Him, we can become children of God and live eternally in His presence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout history, there have been instances where God revealed Himself more visibly to people. For example, during the exodus from Egypt, God demonstrated His love and power by sending miraculous plagues upon the Egyptians and parting the Red Sea for the Israelites. He also provided them with food and guided them through a pillar of cloud and fire. However, even with these tangible demonstrations of His presence and care, the Israelites still struggled to trust Him when faced with challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eBJp_DWFqJw" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This reveals that further revelation from God would not necessarily increase our ability to trust Him. Our sinful hearts are prone to rebellion and self-rule, as seen in the Israelites' response. The problem lies not in God insufficiently revealing Himself, but in our sinful nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God has revealed enough of His nature for us to trust Him. Through history, nature, and Jesus Christ, He has shown that He is all-powerful, all-knowing, all-wise, all-loving, all-holy, unchanging, and eternal. In this revelation, He has proven Himself worthy of our trust. However, the choice to trust Him ultimately rests with us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To deepen our understanding of God, we should study the Bible carefully. The Bible is God's inerrant Word and provides insights into His character and plan for humanity. By relying on Jesus Christ as our Savior and studying His Word, we can come to know God more intimately and have a close relationship with Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the role of faith in our relationship with God is crucial for every Christian. It helps us recognize that faith is not blind or arbitrary but based on the evidence of God's revelation throughout history and in Scripture. Recognizing this can strengthen our trust and reliance on God, even when faced with challenging circumstances or unanswered questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reflect on your own relationship with God. How has faith played a role in it?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consider the different ways God has revealed Himself to you personally. How have these revelations deepened your faith?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are there areas in your life where you struggle to trust God? How can a deeper understanding of His character and past faithfulness help you overcome those struggles?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take time to study the Bible and discover more about who God is and what He has done. How can this knowledge deepen your faith and relationship with Him?&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Believing in God goes beyond simply acknowledging His existence. It requires a deep faith and commitment to a relationship with Him. The Bible tells us that without faith, it is impossible to please God (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/11/Hebrews-11-6.html"&gt;Hebrews 11:6&lt;/a&gt;). So, what does it mean to believe in God?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Believing in God goes beyond simply acknowledging His existence. It requires a deep faith and commitment to a relationship with Him. The Bible tells us that without faith, it is impossible to please God (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/11/Hebrews-11-6.html"&gt;Hebrews 11:6&lt;/a&gt;). So, what does it mean to believe in God?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Acknowledging God's Existence&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first step in believing in God is acknowledging His existence. Many people around the world believe in some form of the supernatural or a higher power. However, simply believing that God exists is not enough. Even the demons believe in God's existence (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/James/2/James-2-19.html"&gt;James 2:19&lt;/a&gt;). Our belief in God should go beyond mere acknowledgement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Commitment and a Change of Life&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Believing in God should lead to a commitment and a change of life. It's not enough to believe in God without allowing that belief to transform our actions and behavior. Just like how we may believe in the importance of good diet and exercise, but fail to change our lives accordingly, many people believe in God but do not live out their faith. &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/James/1/James-1-26.html"&gt;James 1:26&lt;/a&gt; tells us that faith without actions is dead. Belief in God should inspire us to live according to His will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;True Belief Based on Who God Is&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genuine belief in God is based on who He truly is, as revealed in the Bible. Many people create their own idea of God, picking and choosing aspects that align with their preferences. But true belief requires accepting and worshiping the Triune God who is perfect, omniscient, omnipotent, all-sufficient, immutable, true, faithful, gracious, loving, merciful, holy, and just. We must align our belief with the reality of who God is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Jesus Christ as the Ultimate Revelation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To truly believe in God as He has revealed Himself, we must also believe in Jesus Christ. He is the radiance of God's glory and the exact representation of His being (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/1/Hebrews-1-3.html"&gt;Hebrews 1:3&lt;/a&gt;). Through Jesus, God has shown Himself to us in a way we can understand. Jesus declared that anyone who has seen Him has seen the Father, emphasizing the inseparable connection between Him and God (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/14/John-14-9.html"&gt;John 14:9&lt;/a&gt;–11). Faith in God must include faith in Jesus Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Believing in God is not just about intellectual assent. It requires a genuine relationship with Him and a commitment to live according to His will. Our belief should be based on who God truly is, as revealed in the Bible. Jesus Christ is the ultimate revelation of God, and faith in Him is essential for a true belief in God. Without this belief, we cannot honor God or have a genuine relationship with Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take a moment to reflect on your own belief in God. Is it based on who He truly is, or have you created your own version of Him? Are you living out your faith in practical ways, allowing it to transform your actions and behavior? Consider the importance of believing in Jesus Christ as the ultimate revelation of God and the key to having a genuine relationship with Him.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/Our Response to God/Seeking God"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Seeking Answers: Questioning God's Plan in Faith</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/question-god/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-08-21T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-08-21T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-08-21:/question-god/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Questioning God&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Questioning God is a natural part of our faith journey, and it is important to understand how and why we question Him. Throughout the Bible, we see examples of individuals who questioned God in various circumstances, and God responded to them with patience and understanding. It is crucial to approach God with sincerity and an earnest heart when we have questions, seeking His wisdom and guidance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Right Way to Question God&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we question God, it is essential to do so with humility, trust, and an open mind. The prophet Habakkuk questioned God, seeking answers about His plan. Instead of rebuking Habakkuk, God patiently answered his questions, resulting in the prophet praising the Lord. Similarly, many people in the Psalms cry out to God, desperately seeking His intervention and salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus Himself encouraged us to ask, search, and knock, assuring us that we will receive what we seek if we persist. This shows that questioning God is not inherently wrong but rather a way for us to seek a deeper understanding of His will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Examples of Questioning God in the Bible&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Numerous godly individuals in the Bible expressed doubts and questioned their ability to serve God. Moses doubted his capability to lead the Israelites out of Egypt, Gideon questioned his role in God's plan, Elijah expressed uncertainty about his purpose, Jeremiah had doubts about his calling, Abraham questioned God's promises, Joshua asked about God's actions, and even the disciples had reservations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These examples demonstrate that questioning God does not necessarily indicate a lack of faith but rather a desire for clarity and reassurance. We can take comfort in knowing that even those close to God had questions and uncertainties at times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Insincere Questions and Unbelief&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While sincere questions are welcomed by God, insincere questions from a hypocritical heart are different. In the Bible, the Pharisees and Jewish leaders often posed questions to Jesus in an attempt to trick or trap Him. Jesus refused to answer these questions because they lacked sincerity and were driven by ulterior motives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unbelief is another factor that can hinder our ability to question God with sincerity. It is essential to trust in the Lord and believe in His existence and His faithfulness to reward those who earnestly seek Him. When King Saul disobeyed God, his questions went unanswered, highlighting the importance of faith and obedience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Differentiating Doubts from Attacking God's Character&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a distinction between wondering why God allows certain events to occur and directly questioning His goodness or truthfulness. Doubts are not synonymous with attacking God's sovereignty or character. Such attitudes stem from spiritual blindness, rebellion, and disobedience against God. People who do not belong to God may question His works due to their lack of understanding and faith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is crucial to approach our questions with a humble spirit, a trusting heart, and an open mind. God understands our weaknesses, fears, and uncertainties. He invites us to seek transparent fellowship with Him, knowing that our inner intentions determine whether it is right or wrong to question Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/d15Q3wxD1HY" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Maintaining Trust in God&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although God may not always answer our questions in the way we expect or desire, we can trust that He knows what is best for us. We must remember that He sees the bigger picture and has a sovereign perspective that surpasses our limited understanding. Our faith should not waver when we face unanswered questions but rather deepen as we trust in His wisdom and love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Questioning God is a significant aspect of our relationship with Him. It allows us to grow in faith, seek His guidance, and gain a deeper understanding of His will. By questioning with sincerity, humility, and trust, we foster a closer relationship with God and develop a stronger faith that can withstand doubts and uncertainties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have you ever questioned God? How did it impact your faith journey?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can you approach God with sincere questions, seeking His wisdom and guidance?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reflect on the examples of individuals in the Bible who questioned God. What can you learn from their experiences?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can you differentiate between doubts and attacking God's character? How does this understanding affect your relationship with Him?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consider the importance of maintaining trust in God, even when our questions go unanswered. How can you deepen your faith and trust in His sovereign perspective?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we engage in questioning God, let us remember to do so with a heart of humility, trust, and openness. It is through seeking His wisdom and guidance that we can grow in our faith and deepen our relationship with Him.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/Our Response to God/Honest Questions"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Praise the Lord: Your Guide to Ultimate Worship and Devotion</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/praise-the-lord/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-08-07T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-08-07T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-08-07:/praise-the-lord/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Praise the Lord: Understanding the Meaning and Importance&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Praising the Lord is an essential part of worshiping God. It is an act of expressing adoration, approval, and gratitude towards Him for His traits, works, and character. In the Bible, there are multiple words in Hebrew and Greek translated as "praise," but they all convey the same fundamental idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What does it mean to praise the Lord?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To praise the Lord is to acknowledge and honor Him for who He is and what He has done. It involves acts of blessing, commending, honoring, thanking, celebrating, and rejoicing. We praise the Lord because He is worthy of all our praise. His love, faithfulness, mercy, justice, and promises make Him deserving of our adoration and approval.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Elements of Praise&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When King David brought the ark of the covenant back to Jerusalem, he appointed Levites to minister before the Lord, extol Him, thank Him, and praise Him. Their role was to proclaim His name, make known His deeds, remember His wonders and miracles, and declare His glory among the nations. David instructed them to sing praises to the Lord and worship Him in the splendor of His holiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/f2oxGYpuLkw" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This passage from &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-Chronicles/16/1-Chronicles-16-8.html"&gt;1 Chronicles 16:8&lt;/a&gt;–36 highlights several important aspects of praising God:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Making God known: Praising God helps spread knowledge of His greatness among the nations. It involves extolling His goodness and declaring His marvelous deeds to others.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remembering God's works: Praising the Lord includes recalling His wonders, miracles, judgments, faithfulness, and promises. It acknowledges that He remembers His covenant forever.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Proclaiming salvation: Praise involves declaring God's salvation day after day and acknowledging that He is the only one who can save us.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Universal praise: All people are called upon to praise the Lord because He is great and worthy of praise. Even nature itself is invited to join in proclaiming His reign.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Continual praise: Praising the Lord is not a one-time event but an ongoing act of worship that should be practiced continually.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Praise in Worship&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Praise is a central aspect of worshiping God. King David set aside a division of the Levites to praise the Lord with musical instruments in the future temple. During the rebuilding of the temple, when the foundation was laid, the priests and Levites praised the Lord with trumpets and cymbals, singing, "He is good; his love toward Israel endures forever." The people responded with a great shout of praise because they recognized the significance of this milestone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Reasons for Praise&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Ephesians 1, the apostle Paul gives us many reasons to praise the Lord. These include God's blessings in the heavenly realms, His election, sanctification, adoption, glorious grace, redemption through Christ's blood, forgiveness, wisdom, understanding, and His plan for the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When our lives are filled with the righteousness of Christ, it brings glory and praise to God. Paul prayed for the Philippians that their love would abound more and more so that they may be pure and blameless, filled with the fruit of righteousness. James warns against praising God while cursing others, emphasizing that our actions and words should align with God's character if we genuinely want to praise Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How and When to Praise&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can praise the Lord in various ways: through singing, dancing, playing musical instruments, using our words, displaying uprightness in our actions, and praising Him with all our hearts. The Bible encourages us to praise God at all times because He is worthy of our adoration and approval.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the meaning and importance of praising the Lord helps us develop a deeper relationship with Him. It allows us to express our love, gratitude, and reverence for His character and works. Praising God also helps us make Him known to others, as we proclaim His greatness and acknowledge His salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can you incorporate more praise into your daily life and worship?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What aspects of God's character or works are you particularly grateful for and want to praise Him for?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can praising God impact your perspective on life and your relationship with Him?&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Understanding God's will can be complex, but it can be broken down into three aspects: His sovereign will, His revealed will, and His dispositional will. Each aspect provides insights into how God's will operates in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1. God's Sovereign Will&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God's sovereign will, also known as His …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;God's Will&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding God's will can be complex, but it can be broken down into three aspects: His sovereign will, His revealed will, and His dispositional will. Each aspect provides insights into how God's will operates in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1. God's Sovereign Will&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God's sovereign will, also known as His hidden will, reveals His role as the ruler of the universe who ordains all that happens. It encompasses God's decrees and is often unknown to us until it unfolds. Nothing occurs outside of God's sovereign will. For example, Joseph being taken to Egypt, imprisoned, and eventually becoming a savior to his people was part of God's sovereign will (Genesis 37–50). This aspect of God's will can be further divided into two categories: His efficacious will and His permissive will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God's efficacious will directly contributes to the fulfillment of His desires, while His permissive will allows for an indirect fulfillment of His desires. Although God permits events and happenings, it does not mean He directly causes everything to happen. An example of God's permissive will is seen in the story of Joseph and his brothers. God allowed Joseph to be kidnapped and enslaved by his brothers, which was a sinful act. However, God used this situation for a greater purpose (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/50/Genesis-50-20.html"&gt;Genesis 50:20&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Understanding God's sovereign will helps us recognize that nothing happens outside of His control. Even when we face difficult circumstances or encounter evil, we can trust that God is still at work according to His purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; How does knowing that God is in control of all things impact your trust in Him during challenging times?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2. God's Revealed Will&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1zo3fJYtS-o" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;God's revealed will refers to what He has made known to us through the Bible. It includes His precepts or commands that guide our actions and behavior. God's revealed will is not hidden from us but is plainly stated in Scripture. For example, &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Micah/6/Micah-6-8.html"&gt;Micah 6:8&lt;/a&gt; tells us that God requires us to act justly, love mercy, and walk humbly with Him. We also know that God's revealed will includes commands such as speaking the truth in love (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Ephesians/4/Ephesians-4-15.html"&gt;Ephesians 4:15&lt;/a&gt;), repenting and turning to God (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Acts/3/Acts-3-19.html"&gt;Acts 3:19&lt;/a&gt;), avoiding adultery (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-Corinthians/6/1-Corinthians-6-18.html"&gt;1 Corinthians 6:18&lt;/a&gt;), and refraining from drunkenness (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Ephesians/5/Ephesians-5-18.html"&gt;Ephesians 5:18&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; God's revealed will provides us with guidance for living a life that pleases Him. It helps us understand what is right and wrong according to His standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; How does following God's revealed will impact your relationships with others and your personal character?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;3. God's Dispositional Will&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God's dispositional will refers to His attitude or desires. It reveals what pleases or displeases Him. For example, &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-Timothy/2/1-Timothy-2-4.html"&gt;1 Timothy 2:4&lt;/a&gt; states that God wants all people to be saved and come to a knowledge of the truth. This expresses His disposition towards the lost; He desires their salvation. However, while God's heart desires all to be saved, not all choose to accept His offer of salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Recognizing God's dispositional will helps us understand His heart for humanity. It reminds us of His desire for people to experience His love and salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; How does understanding God's dispositional will impact your view of His love for humanity and your role in sharing the Gospel?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding God's will involves recognizing these three aspects: His sovereign will, revealed will, and dispositional will. Each aspect provides valuable insights into how God works in the world and our lives. While these concepts may seem complex at first, breaking them down into simpler terms allows us to grasp the depth of God's will and its significance for our faith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary, God's sovereign will showcases His control over all things, His revealed will guides our actions and behavior, and His dispositional will reveals His desires and attitude towards humanity. Embracing these aspects of God's will leads us to a deeper understanding of His character and purpose for our lives.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/Our Response to God/Knowing God"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Divine Authority: Understanding God's Imposing Will</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/god-imposing/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-07-23T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-07-23T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-07-23:/god-imposing/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;God's Nature: Love Personified&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most profound statements in the Bible is "God is love" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-John/4/1-John-4-8.html"&gt;1 John 4:8&lt;/a&gt;). This declaration holds immense significance as it reveals that love is not just something God does, but it is an inherent part of His very nature. Love permeates every …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;God's Nature: Love Personified&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most profound statements in the Bible is "God is love" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-John/4/1-John-4-8.html"&gt;1 John 4:8&lt;/a&gt;). This declaration holds immense significance as it reveals that love is not just something God does, but it is an inherent part of His very nature. Love permeates every aspect of who He is, even His wrath and anger. When we see God as angry, it is essential to understand that His anger is filtered through His great love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Love and Anger in God&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God's anger is never directed towards His children, those who have come to Christ in faith for forgiveness of sins. All His anger was poured out on His own Son, Jesus, on the cross. For those who have placed their faith in Christ, God sees them as perfect because they are covered by Jesus' righteousness. Therefore, He will never be angry with them again. The Bible tells us that "God is angry with the wicked every day" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/7/Psalm-7-11.html"&gt;Psalm 7:11&lt;/a&gt;), but as believers in Christ, we are not counted among the wicked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Requirement of Perfection&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While God's nature is loving, it does not negate His requirement of perfection. However, because He is loving, He sent Christ to die on the cross in our place, satisfying God's demand for perfection. Through Jesus' sacrifice, we can now enter into a relationship with God and become a part of His family. This acceptance into God's family is solely based on the finished work of Christ on the cross.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Examining Our Relationship with God&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we still perceive God as imposing and angry despite knowing these truths, it may indicate uncertainty about our relationship with Him. The Bible encourages us to examine ourselves to determine whether we truly belong to Christ (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/2-Corinthians/13/2-Corinthians-13-5.html"&gt;2 Corinthians 13:5&lt;/a&gt;). If we doubt our salvation, we can repent and ask Him to save us. He will forgive our sins and give us His Holy Spirit, assuring us of our status as His children. Once we are confident of our place in God's family, we can draw closer to Him by reading and studying His Word, seeking to know Him more intimately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding that God is love and that His anger is filtered through His great love helps us view Him in a more accurate light. It enables us to approach Him not with fear and apprehension but with confidence and assurance of His love for us. Recognizing that God's anger was fully satisfied through Jesus' sacrifice on the cross assures us that we are no longer objects of His wrath. Instead, we are recipients of His grace and mercy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ICI5Yr8v0nc" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider how your perception of God's nature impacts your relationship with Him. Are there any misunderstandings or misconceptions that need to be addressed? Take time to reflect on the truth that God is love and how that truth can transform your perspective and experience with Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Seeking a Personal Relationship with a Loving Father&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God desires a personal relationship with each one of us. He loves us deeply and wants us to know Him intimately as a loving and gracious Father. He has assured us that if we seek Him with all our hearts, we will find Him (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Jeremiah/29/Jeremiah-29-13.html"&gt;Jeremiah 29:13&lt;/a&gt;). Through this pursuit, we can truly know Him, not as an imposing and angry figure, but as a loving Father who longs to have a close relationship with His children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Approaching God in Faith&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Approaching God in faith is the key to establishing a personal relationship with Him. It involves acknowledging our need for forgiveness and salvation, recognizing Jesus as the only way to reconcile with God. When we come to God in faith, repenting of our sins and accepting Jesus as our Savior, He forgives us, cleanses us, and adopts us into His family. This act of faith opens the door for a personal relationship with Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Role of the Holy Spirit&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once we have placed our faith in Christ, God gives us the gift of His Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit takes up residence in our hearts and serves as our constant companion and guide. He assures us of our salvation, reminds us of God's truth, convicts us of sin, and empowers us to live in obedience to God's Word.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Growing Closer to God&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To cultivate a deeper relationship with God, we need to actively engage with Him. Reading and studying His Word, the Bible, is crucial for understanding His character, His promises, and His will for our lives. Through the Scriptures, God speaks to us, reveals Himself, and instructs us on how to live according to His ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prayer is another essential component of nurturing our relationship with God. It is through prayer that we communicate with Him, pour out our hearts, seek His guidance, and experience His presence. Prayer is not merely about making requests but also about listening to God's voice and aligning our hearts with His.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seeking a personal relationship with God is more than just a religious duty; it is a transformative journey that brings fulfillment and purpose to our lives. Knowing God intimately allows us to experience His love, receive His guidance, and find peace in His presence. It is through this relationship that we find true satisfaction and discover our true identity as beloved children of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reflect on your own relationship with God. Are you actively seeking to grow closer to Him? How can you deepen your understanding of Him through studying His Word and spending time in prayer? Consider taking intentional steps in nurturing your relationship with Him so that you can experience the fullness of His love and grace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God's nature is love personified. When we understand that His anger is filtered through His great love, it changes our perception of Him. We can approach Him not as an imposing and angry God but as a loving and gracious Father who desires a personal relationship with us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By placing our faith in Christ, we are covered by His righteousness, and God's anger is appeased. We become part of God's family, adopted through the finished work of Christ on the cross. As we seek Him with all our hearts, read His Word, and communicate with Him through prayer, we can grow closer to Him and experience the fullness of His love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding God's nature as love and seeking a personal relationship with Him allows us to encounter His grace, mercy, and transformative power in our lives. It is through this relationship that we find true fulfillment and discover our purpose as beloved children of God.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/Our Response to God/Knowing God"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Unlocking the Divine Favor: Secrets to Experiencing God's Blessings</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/favor-of-god/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-07-21T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-07-21T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-07-21:/favor-of-god/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;The Favor of God&lt;/h2&gt;

When we favor someone, we want to be with them, delight in them, and connect with them in a special way. Similarly …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;The Favor of God&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The favor of God can be described as "demonstrated delight." It is the tangible evidence that a person has the approval of the Lord. When we favor someone, we want to be with them, delight in them, and connect with them in a special way. Similarly, God shows favor to those who delight in Him, connect with Him, and honor Him above all else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To understand how to obtain God's favor, we must first recognize that favor is closely related to grace in the Bible. The only way to receive God's favor is by believing in the Lord Jesus and accepting Him as our Savior. Through faith in Jesus, we are saved by grace (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Ephesians/2/Ephesians-2-8.html"&gt;Ephesians 2:8-9&lt;/a&gt;) and experience the favor of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God seeks out those who love Him and obey His commands so that He can bless, guide, and protect them. This does not mean that everyone who is prosperous or healthy has found favor with God, nor does it mean that those who have God's favor will never face difficulties. Many people in the Bible who had God's favor also experienced hardships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those who are favored by God know that He is with them and that nothing can happen to them apart from His good purpose. They have confidence that their sins are forgiven, they are within God's plan, and that He is there for them at all times. They walk with God as their closest friend and appreciate the blessings He provides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To seek God's favor, we need to humble our hearts before Him, seek Him for Himself rather than just His blessings, and arrange our lives around loving Him with all our heart, soul, mind, and strength. Seeking wisdom is also important in obtaining favor from the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Understanding the favor of God helps us have a deeper relationship with Him. It reminds us to seek Him above all else and pursue a life that pleases Him. Knowing that we have God's favor gives us confidence and peace, even in the midst of difficulties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; How does knowing that God's favor is not based on external circumstances but on our relationship with Him affect the way we view success and hardships? How can seeking wisdom help us obtain God's favor in our lives?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Characteristics of Those Favored by God&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bible gives us insights into the characteristics of those who find favor with God. &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/66/Isaiah-66-2.html"&gt;Isaiah 66:2&lt;/a&gt; states that God looks with favor upon those who are humble, contrite in spirit, and who tremble at His Word. Second Chronicles 16:9 tells us that God shows Himself strong on behalf of those whose hearts are perfect toward Him. Having a heart perfect toward God means seeking His favor above all else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to note that finding favor with God does not guarantee a life free from difficulties or hardships. In fact, many individuals in the Bible who were favored by God also faced challenges. However, they remained faithful to God and trusted in His plan for their lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Understanding the characteristics of those favored by God helps us evaluate our own hearts and actions. It encourages us to cultivate humility, contrition, and a reverence for God's Word in our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; How can we cultivate humility and contrition in our relationship with God? How does having a heart perfect toward God affect the way we make decisions and prioritize our lives?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Assurance and Blessings of God's Favor&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those who have found favor with God can rest assured that He is with them and that His good purpose will prevail in their lives. &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/8/Romans-8-28.html"&gt;Romans 8:28&lt;/a&gt; assures us that all things work together for good for those who love God and are called according to His purpose. This assurance gives believers confidence and peace, knowing that even in difficult times, God is working for their ultimate good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The favor of God also brings blessings. &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/5/Psalm-5-12.html"&gt;Psalm 5:12&lt;/a&gt; declares that the Lord blesses the righteous and surrounds them with His favor as with a shield. These blessings may not always be material or external, but they include the joy of knowing our sins are forgiven, being within God's plan, and experiencing His presence at all times. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Understanding the assurance and blessings that come with God's favor encourages us to trust in His plan for our lives and to find contentment in His presence, regardless of our circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It&lt;/strong&gt;: How does knowing that God's favor brings assurance and blessings change the way we view challenges and difficulties? How can we cultivate a heart of gratitude for the spiritual blessings that come with God's favor?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Seeking God's Favor&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GCxx3bAtJ_w" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Bible invites us to seek God's favor. &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/119/Psalm-119-58.html"&gt;Psalm 119:58&lt;/a&gt;, 135 urges us to seek His favor wholeheartedly. Seeking God's favor requires humility, a genuine desire for Him, and aligning our lives with His will. It means seeking His kingdom and righteousness above all else (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/6/Matthew-6-33.html"&gt;Matthew 6:33&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One way to obtain favor from the Lord is to seek wisdom. &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Proverbs/8/Proverbs-8-35.html"&gt;Proverbs 8:35&lt;/a&gt; tells us that those who find wisdom find life and receive favor from the Lord. Seeking wisdom involves seeking understanding and guidance from God's Word, allowing His wisdom to shape our thoughts, decisions, and actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Seeking God's favor is an ongoing pursuit in our relationship with Him. It helps us stay aligned with His will, find guidance in His wisdom, and experience the fullness of life He desires for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; What steps can we take to seek God's favor in our daily lives? How can seeking wisdom from God's Word impact our decision-making process?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Reality of God's Favor&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to note that God's favor is not a guarantee of a problem-free life or a sign of superiority over others. It is not an excuse for pride or judgment. The reality is that many people who are favored by God also face challenges and difficulties. In fact, the Bible is filled with examples of individuals who experienced God's favor but also endured hardships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The favor of God is not about worldly success or material blessings. It is about having a deep relationship with Him, knowing that He is with us, and experiencing His presence in our lives. It is about finding joy and contentment in His love and grace, regardless of our circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Understanding the reality of God's favor helps us avoid misunderstandings and false expectations. It keeps us humble, dependent on God, and focused on the true blessings that come from knowing Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; How does understanding the reality of God's favor change the way we view success and hardships? How can we guard against pride or judgment when we experience God's favor in our lives?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;In Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The favor of God is a tangible evidence of His delight in us. It is not based on external circumstances but on our relationship with Him. Through faith in Jesus, we receive God's grace and experience His favor. Those who are favored by God have confidence in His presence, assurance in His plan, and the blessings of His love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seeking God's favor involves humility, a genuine desire for Him, and aligning our lives with His will. It includes seeking wisdom from His Word and prioritizing His kingdom above all else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While having God's favor does not exempt us from difficulties, it gives us peace and confidence knowing that He works all things for our good. The reality of God's favor reminds us to find joy and contentment in His love and grace, regardless of our circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Understanding the favor of God deepens our relationship with Him and helps us live according to His will. It encourages us to seek His favor above all else and find contentment in His presence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; How can we cultivate a heart that seeks God's favor above all else?

&lt;p&gt;The act of blessing God is mentioned primarily in the Old Testament, particularly in the Psalms. While the King James Version uses the phrase "bless the Lord," modern translations often render it as "praise the Lord." So what does it mean for us to bless God? Let's explore this concept and understand its significance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What Does It Mean to Bless God?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hebrew word translated as "bless" or "praise" means literally "to kneel." Therefore, to bless the Lord means to praise Him, exalt Him, and worship Him. It is an act of kneeling in worship before our Creator. The Psalms beautifully express blessings upon God for His counsel, holiness, dominion over all things, honor, and majesty. When we bless God, we offer Him our praise and blessings because He deserves them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Purpose of Blessing God&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God is glorified when we bless and praise Him. Our acknowledgment of Him through praise, adoration, thanksgiving, and love fulfills the purpose for which we were created. However, it is important to note that we can only truly bless God when we are in a right relationship with Him. &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Proverbs/28/Proverbs-28-9.html"&gt;Proverbs 28:9&lt;/a&gt; warns that if anyone turns a deaf ear to the Law, even their prayers are detestable. Therefore, it is only once we have been blessed by God in the heavenly realms that we can bless God in return in a way that pleases Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the meaning of blessing God allows us to engage in true worship. It helps us shift our focus from ourselves and our desires to acknowledge and glorify our Creator. When we bless God, we align ourselves with His will and purpose for our lives. It deepens our relationship with Him and brings us into a closer communion with His Spirit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider your own approach to worship. Do you see it as a means to receive blessings from God, or do you approach it with a heart of gratitude and adoration, seeking to bless Him? Take time to reflect on the Psalms and the examples of blessing God found within them. How can you incorporate these expressions of praise and worship into your own life?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Blessing God: A Deeper Understanding&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To gain a deeper understanding of the concept of blessing God, let's delve into some key points and explore them further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1. Blessing God as Praise and Worship&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The act of blessing God is closely intertwined with praise and worship. When we bless God, we are acknowledging His greatness, His attributes, and His dominion over all things. Just as we offer our prayers and supplications to Him, we also offer our praises and blessings. This act of worship allows us to enter into His presence and magnify His name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2. Blessing God for His Attributes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Psalms are filled with blessings upon God for various aspects of His character and nature. We bless Him for His counsel, which provides wisdom and guidance in our lives. We bless Him for His holiness, recognizing His perfect purity and righteousness. We bless Him for His dominion over all things, acknowledging His sovereignty and control. And we bless Him for His honor and majesty, praising Him for His glorious splendor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blessing God in this way helps us cultivate a heart of gratitude and humility. It reminds us that He is the source of all blessings and that everything we have comes from Him. By recognizing His attributes and giving Him the honor He deserves, we grow in our understanding of who He is and deepen our relationship with Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gK0fbhGdX4A" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take a moment to consider the specific attributes of God that you are grateful for in your own life. How can you express your blessings and praise for these attributes in your worship? Consider incorporating them into your prayers, songs, or even journaling as a way to bless God for who He is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Significance of Blessing God&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blessing God is not just an act of obedience; it holds great significance in our relationship with Him. Let's explore some key reasons why blessing God matters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1. Honoring God as Our Creator&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we bless God, we acknowledge Him as our Creator. We recognize that He is the one who formed us and breathed life into us. By offering our blessings and praise, we honor Him as the source of our existence and everything good in our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2. Glorifying God&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blessing God brings glory to His name. When we exalt Him and magnify His attributes, we reflect His greatness to the world around us. Our worship becomes a testimony of His goodness, mercy, and power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;3. Shifting Our Focus&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blessing God helps us shift our focus from ourselves and our desires to Him and His will. It reminds us that life is not solely about what we can receive from God but also about honoring and serving Him. By blessing God, we align ourselves with His purpose for our lives and seek to bring Him joy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the significance of blessing God helps us cultivate a lifestyle of worship. It encourages us to make praising and honoring Him a central part of our daily lives. As we continually bless God, we grow in our love for Him and become more aware of His presence in every aspect of our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider how often you intentionally bless God throughout your day. Are your thoughts, words, and actions focused on magnifying His name? Take time each day to deliberately bless God for who He is and what He has done in your life. This intentional act of worship will deepen your relationship with Him and bring you into a closer communion with His Spirit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blessing God is an act of worship and praise. It involves acknowledging and honoring Him for His attributes, dominion, and wisdom. When we bless God, we shift our focus from ourselves to Him, deepening our relationship with Him and glorifying His name. By understanding the meaning and significance of blessing God, we can cultivate a lifestyle of worship and draw nearer to our Heavenly Father.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let us take time to bless God today, offering our praise, adoration, thanksgiving, and love to the One who deserves it all. May our lives be filled with the joy of blessing our Creator and experiencing the richness of His presence.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/Our Response to God/Worshiping God"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>"Unveiling God's Perfect Will: A Christian"'s Guide to Divine Guidance'</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/gods-perfect-will/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-07-16T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-07-16T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-07-16:/gods-perfect-will/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;God's Perfect Will&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to understanding God's perfect will for our lives, many of us seek specific guidance from Him.

However, God reveals a different approach to determining His …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;God's Perfect Will&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to understanding God's perfect will for our lives, many of us seek specific guidance from Him. We want to know where to work, where to live, whom to marry, and even what car to buy. However, God reveals a different approach to determining His perfect will. While He does have specific plans for each person, His perfect will is the same for all. It includes His desire for everyone to be saved and come to a knowledge of the truth (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-Timothy/2/1-Timothy-2-3.html"&gt;1 Timothy 2:3&lt;/a&gt;–4). It also involves living a sanctified life, avoiding sexual immorality, learning self-control, and doing good as a result of our faith (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-Thessalonians/4/1-Thessalonians-4-3.html"&gt;1 Thessalonians 4:3&lt;/a&gt;–5; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-Peter/2/1-Peter-2-15.html"&gt;1 Peter 2:15&lt;/a&gt;–16). Additionally, giving thanks in all circumstances is part of God's perfect will for us (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-Thessalonians/5/1-Thessalonians-5-18.html"&gt;1 Thessalonians 5:18&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Confession and Seeking Forgiveness&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To align ourselves with God's perfect will, we must start by confessing any known sins. We can trust that God is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-John/1/1-John-1-9.html"&gt;1 John 1:9&lt;/a&gt;). Additionally, we should ask God to search our hearts and reveal any offensive ways within us (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/139/Psalm-139-23.html"&gt;Psalm 139:23&lt;/a&gt;–24). This introspection helps us identify areas where we may have strayed from God's will and need His forgiveness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Seeking Forgiveness and Restitution&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If our actions involved sinning against someone else, it is crucial that we seek their forgiveness and make amends. Zacchaeus is an example of repentance and restitution when he promised to repay four times the amount he cheated from others (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/19/Luke-19-8.html"&gt;Luke 19:8&lt;/a&gt;). This act of seeking forgiveness and making restitution demonstrates a "fruit in keeping with repentance" as preached by John the Baptist (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/3/Luke-3-9.html"&gt;Luke 3:9&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Glorifying God in All We Do&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Returning to the Lord and seeking to glorify Him is an essential aspect of living in alignment with His perfect will. In everything we do, whether in work or daily life, we should strive to bring glory to God (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-Corinthians/10/1-Corinthians-10-31.html"&gt;1 Corinthians 10:31&lt;/a&gt;). By making God the center of our actions and decisions, we can ensure that we are living according to His perfect will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Relying on the Holy Spirit's Guidance&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We cannot live out God's perfect will in our own strength. We must rely on the power of the Holy Spirit who dwells within us. Jesus promised that the Holy Spirit would be our guide and teacher (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/14/John-14-26.html"&gt;John 14:26&lt;/a&gt;; 16:13). With the Spirit's guidance, we can discern God's will and walk in obedience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding that God's perfect will is not solely about specific decisions, such as what car to buy or where to go for lunch, is crucial. While these choices are important, they do not determine whether we are in alignment with God's perfect will. The book of Proverbs reminds us that although we can make plans, it is ultimately the Lord who directs our steps (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Proverbs/16/Proverbs-16-1.html"&gt;Proverbs 16:1&lt;/a&gt;–9). Seeking the Lord, committing our ways to Him, and trusting in His sovereignty allows us to make decisions with humility and obedience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uY8VwyNBM9s" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Missing God's Perfect Will&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While God's perfect will is unchanging and available to all believers, it is possible to miss out on experiencing His best for us due to sinful or unwise decisions. When we make choices that go against God's principles, there may be consequences that affect our lives. Examples from Scripture illustrate how individuals missed God's best due to disobedience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;King Jehoash only partially obeyed God's command and missed out on complete victory over his enemies (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/2-Kings/13/2-Kings-13-18.html"&gt;2 Kings 13:18&lt;/a&gt;–19). Moses struck the rock instead of speaking to it as God commanded, and as a result, he was not allowed to enter the Promised Land (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Numbers/20/Numbers-20-10.html"&gt;Numbers 20:10&lt;/a&gt;–13). King Jehoshaphat allied himself with a wicked king and suffered the loss of his fleet (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/2-Chronicles/20/2-Chronicles-20-35.html"&gt;2 Chronicles 20:35&lt;/a&gt;–37).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we find ourselves in a position where we have missed God's perfect will, we should trust in His forgiveness and do the next right thing. The Bible assures us that even in our failures, "all things work together for good to those who love God, to those who are called according to His purpose" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/8/Romans-8-28.html"&gt;Romans 8:28&lt;/a&gt;). We can still be forgiven and continue to follow the truth, living in obedience to God's will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding God's perfect will helps us navigate life's decisions with clarity and confidence. It reminds us that our ultimate purpose is to glorify God and live in alignment with His principles. By seeking forgiveness, making amends, and relying on the Holy Spirit's guidance, we can continually move closer to God's perfect will for our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you believe that God has a specific plan for your life? How does knowing His desire for all people to be saved and live a sanctified life impact your understanding of His will?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have you experienced the consequences of making ungodly or unwise decisions? How did it affect your perception of being in alignment with God's perfect will?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reflect on how you can more intentionally seek God's will in your daily life. Consider implementing practices such as confession, seeking forgiveness, and relying on the Holy Spirit's guidance.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The concept of God demanding worship raises important questions about His nature and our role as human beings created in His image. While it may seem that God seeks worship to boost His self-esteem or gain emotional support, a closer examination of Scripture reveals a deeper understanding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Nature of God&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To understand why God demands worship, we must first recognize His nature. According to the Bible, God is the Creator and Sustainer of the entire universe. He is eternal, infinite, and self-existing, needing nothing outside of Himself to maintain His existence. In contrast, human beings require various things like air, water, food, and sleep to survive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4OjoMBa5qG4" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, God is described as light, love, and life. He is the true source of these foundational realities. We are fully dependent on Him for our existence and sustenance. In fact, the apostle Paul stated that in God we "live, move, and have our being" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Acts/17/Acts-17-28.html"&gt;Acts 17:28&lt;/a&gt;). God provides us with every good and perfect gift.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Benefits of Worship&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God's command to worship Him is not for His own benefit but for ours. Since God is love itself (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-John/4/1-John-4-8.html"&gt;1 John 4:8&lt;/a&gt;) and His love toward us is the highest form of love, worshiping Him works out for our benefit. The act of worship aligns our hearts and lives around what is truly valuable and worthy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without assigning ultimate worth to God, we would esteem something else as ultimately valuable. However, everything in this world is temporary and perishing. They are unable to provide us with real and eternal light, love, and life. Giving ourselves to these temporary things will eventually lead to ruin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God desires worship because He knows that our ultimate well-being lies in knowing Him and having a personal relationship with Him. He is the only true and living God, the source of all good things. True worship recalibrates our hearts and enables us to love God and others rightly. It fills us with gratitude and empowers us to live purposefully for God's glory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding God's desire for worship helps us grasp the significance of our relationship with Him. It reminds us that we were designed to worship. If we fail to worship God, we will end up worshiping something else—an idol of our own making, something temporary and perishing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recognizing the importance of worship allows us to prioritize our lives correctly. It helps us avoid investing our time, energy, and resources in things that cannot truly fulfill us. By worshiping the true and living God, we align ourselves with what is ultimate and experience the benefits of a deep and meaningful relationship with Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does worshiping God affect your perspective on what is truly valuable in life?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consider the temporary nature of worldly pursuits. How does this impact your priorities?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reflect on the benefits of knowing and worshiping the Creator of all things. How can you cultivate a lifestyle of worship?&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the Bible, the phrase "knowledge of God" can be understood in different contexts. While sometimes it refers to God's knowledge, we will focus on the more common interpretation which refers to our knowledge of God. The knowledge of God is about knowing the truth about Him …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Knowledge of God&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Bible, the phrase "knowledge of God" can be understood in different contexts. While sometimes it refers to God's knowledge, we will focus on the more common interpretation which refers to our knowledge of God. The knowledge of God is about knowing the truth about Him. It begins with God Himself, as He graciously chooses to reveal Himself to humanity in various ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Knowing the Truth about God&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The knowledge of God starts with an understanding of His existence and attributes. Through creation, God reveals Himself to everyone so that every person knows at least about His "eternal power and divine nature" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/1/Romans-1-20.html"&gt;Romans 1:20&lt;/a&gt;). This basic knowledge of God's righteousness and our moral responsibility is enough for us to be accountable for not following His law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Growing in the Knowledge of God&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those who fear God, or have a relationship with Him, can grow in the knowledge of God as He reveals Himself. This growth happens through various means such as the Scriptures, His people, His Holy Spirit, and His Son Jesus Christ. The Bible is a primary source of revelation, providing us with knowledge about God's will, works, and character. As we delve deeper into the Word of God, we gain wisdom and understanding through the guidance of the Holy Spirit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Relationship with God&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Bible, the knowledge of God is closely tied to having a relationship with Him. Just as we grow closer to someone the more we know them, as we grow in our knowledge of God, we develop a deeper relationship with Him. Our goal as Christians is to become more like Jesus Christ through growing in the knowledge of God. This transformation should motivate us to live a life that is pleasing to Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Sharing the Knowledge of God&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we grow in our knowledge of God, we are called to share it with others. Paul's ministry serves as an example of spreading the knowledge of God to everyone around him. We should also share the knowledge of God wherever we go so that others can come to know Him through the grace of His Son. Additionally, as we serve one another in Christian community, we help build each other up in our knowledge of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QPywCD-TSd0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; The knowledge of God is foundational to our faith. It provides us with a deeper understanding of who God is and helps us align our lives with His will. As we grow in our knowledge of God, we draw closer to Him and become more like Jesus Christ. Additionally, sharing the knowledge of God is crucial for the expansion of His Kingdom and the transformation of lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; How can you actively seek to grow in your knowledge of God? In what ways can you share the knowledge of God with others in your everyday life?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By understanding the importance of the knowledge of God and actively seeking to grow in it, we can deepen our relationship with Him and impact others with His truth.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/Our Response to God/Knowing God"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Why Worship God: Exploring the Heart of Christian Devotion</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/why-worship-god/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-06-29T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-06-29T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-06-29:/why-worship-god/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Why Worship God&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Worshipping God is the supreme purpose for which humans were created. It is at the very core of our existence and the central function of the Church. The Bible teaches that God desires our worship and is the only one worthy of it. But why should we worship God? Let's explore several key reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1. Our Purpose as Creations of God&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God created us with a deep longing to comprehend our eternal purpose and know our infinite Creator. &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Ecclesiastes/3/Ecclesiastes-3-11.html"&gt;Ecclesiastes 3:11&lt;/a&gt; tells us that God planted eternity in our hearts. This explains why we are not satisfied with earthly endeavors and achievements. We yearn for something greater, something beyond ourselves. We have a built-in craving to worship, and God placed eternity in our hearts so that we would hunger and thirst for Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Recognizing our purpose as creations of God helps us understand that only He can truly satisfy the longing within us. It redirects our focus from temporary pursuits to an eternal relationship with our Creator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; What are some of the temporary things you have pursued or worshipped in your life? How has that left you unsatisfied? How might redirecting your worship towards God change your perspective?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2. The Worthiness of God&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Worshipping God reveals that He has captured our attention and won our allegiance. He alone is worthy of our worship, as He is the One who created us and redeemed us through Jesus Christ. Our worship acknowledges His worthiness and exalts Him above all else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Recognizing the worthiness of God helps us prioritize Him above all other things in our lives. It reminds us that nothing else should take His place on the throne of our hearts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; What are some things or people in your life that have taken priority over God? How might recognizing God's worthiness change your perspective and priorities?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;3. Worship as a Lifestyle&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Worship is not just an event or an activity; it is a way of life for believers. The apostle Paul describes worship as offering our bodies as living sacrifices, holy and pleasing to God. It encompasses every aspect of our lives and is dedicated to glorifying God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Understanding worship as a lifestyle helps us realize that every moment and every action can be an opportunity to worship God. It transforms our mundane tasks into acts of worship and service to Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; How might viewing worship as a lifestyle change the way you approach your daily activities? How can you integrate worship into various aspects of your life?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;4. Communion with God&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through worship, we experience fellowship and communion with God. It is how we meet with Him and praise Him for His goodness, love, mercy, grace, wisdom, beauty, truth, holiness, compassion, might, and every other aspect of His character. As we worship, we grow closer to Him, and His will becomes our will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gEoq7vjGRAo" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Engaging in worship allows us to connect with God on a deeper level. It opens our hearts to hear from Him and allows His presence to transform us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; How has worship deepened your relationship with God? In what ways do you experience communion with Him during times of worship?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;5. Testimony to Others&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our worship not only changes us but also makes God known to others and has the power to impact their lives. When we testify to what God has done in us through worship, others may be amazed and put their trust in the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Our worship becomes a powerful witness to those around us. It can draw others closer to God and inspire them to seek a relationship with Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; How has your worship impacted others? Are there ways you can intentionally share your worship experiences with others to testify to God's goodness and draw them closer to Him?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;6. Ultimate Purpose and Eternal Life&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Worshipping God allows us to fulfill our ultimate purpose and prepares us for eternal life in His presence. In the book of Revelation, we catch a glimpse of the future, where a great multitude from every nation stands before the throne of God, worshipping Him. This vision reminds us that our worship of God is not just for this earthly life but is an everlasting expression of our love and adoration for Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Understanding that worship is connected to our ultimate purpose and eternal life helps us focus on what truly matters in the grand scheme of things. It motivates us to live with an eternal perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; How does the promise of eternal life in God's presence impact the way you approach worship? How might focusing on eternity change your priorities and perspective?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, there are numerous reasons why we should worship God. From acknowledging our purpose as creations of God, recognizing His worthiness, and embracing worship as a lifestyle, to experiencing communion with Him and testifying to others, worship plays a crucial role in our relationship with God. Ultimately, our worship leads us to fulfill our ultimate purpose and prepares us for an eternity in His presence. As we engage in worship, let us do so with hearts full of gratitude, awe, and adoration for the One who is truly worthy of all our praise.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/Our Response to God/Worshiping God"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Finding Peace: Overcoming Frustration with God Through Faith</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/frustrated-with-god/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-06-28T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-06-28T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-06-28:/frustrated-with-god/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Frustrated with God: Understanding and Dealing with Our Feelings&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Frustration is a common human emotion that arises when we feel our needs are not being met or when we face seemingly insurmountable problems. At times, this frustration can be directed towards God. We may question why God does not intervene in our situations or why He allows certain things to happen. It is important for Christians to address and understand these feelings of frustration with God, as they can become stumbling blocks in our faith journey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What is Frustration?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frustration is a feeling of impatience and anxiety that arises when our expectations are not met. It often stems from a sense of dissatisfaction with our circumstances or the way others are behaving. In the context of our relationship with God, frustration can arise when we feel that our prayers are going unanswered or when we perceive that God is not addressing our needs in the way we desire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Biblical Examples of Frustration with God&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Bible, we find examples of individuals who experienced frustration with God. One such example is the story of Martha and Mary (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/10/Luke-10-38.html"&gt;Luke 10:38-42&lt;/a&gt;). Martha was frustrated both with her sister for not helping her and with Jesus for not addressing the situation. Jesus responded by reminding Martha that she was worried and upset about many things, emphasizing the importance of being still and knowing God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another well-known story of frustration with God is that of Jonah. After reluctantly delivering God's message to the Ninevites, Jonah became frustrated because he desired to witness their destruction rather than their repentance. Jonah's frustration grew to the point where he wanted to die. In response, God reminded Jonah of his misplaced priorities and lack of compassion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why is Frustration with God Wrong?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frustration with God is ultimately a product of our sinful human nature. It can be evidence of a lack of trust in Him or a misunderstanding of His character. The Bible teaches us that God is perfect and has perfect intentions, timing, methods, and results (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/18/Psalm-18-30.html"&gt;Psalm 18:30&lt;/a&gt;). When we focus our minds on the Lord and trust in Him, we can experience peace instead of frustration (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/26/Isaiah-26-3.html"&gt;Isaiah 26:3&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, frustration with God may stem from our own stubbornness and desires conflicting with God's purposes. It is never advisable to fight against God's will. Saul of Tarsus, later known as the apostle Paul, learned this lesson when Jesus reminded him, "It is hard for you to kick against the goads" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Acts/26/Acts-26-14.html"&gt;Acts 26:14&lt;/a&gt;). Instead of stubbornly insisting on our plans, it is important to humbly submit to God's will through prayer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Dealing with Frustration with God&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we find ourselves frustrated with God, it is essential to seek understanding and resolution. Here are some practical ways to address and navigate these feelings:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;1. Reflect on God's Character and Promises&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take time to study and meditate on the attributes of God revealed in His Word. Understand that He is loving, compassionate, just, and sovereign. Remind yourself of His promises to never leave or forsake you (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Deuteronomy/31/Deuteronomy-31-6.html"&gt;Deuteronomy 31:6&lt;/a&gt;) and to work all things together for good (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/8/Romans-8-28.html"&gt;Romans 8:28&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;2. Seek Wisdom from Scripture and Prayer&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turn to the Bible for guidance and wisdom. Read passages that speak to your specific frustrations or challenges. Engage in prayer, pouring out your heart honestly before God. Ask Him for wisdom, understanding, and peace amidst your frustrations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sxJYjF0zLhU" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;3. Trust in God's Timing&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recognize that God works according to His perfect timing. His ways are higher than our ways (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/55/Isaiah-55-9.html"&gt;Isaiah 55:9&lt;/a&gt;), and He knows what is best for us. Trust that He is working behind the scenes, even when it feels like nothing is happening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;4. Surrender Your Desires to God&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of clinging stubbornly to your own plans and desires, surrender them to God. Recognize that His will may differ from yours, and trust that He knows what is ultimately best for you. Pray for a heart that aligns with His purposes and a willingness to submit to His leading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;5. Seek Support from Fellow Believers&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Share your frustrations and struggles with trusted Christian friends or mentors. They can provide encouragement, prayer, and guidance as you navigate through your frustrations with God. Together, you can seek understanding and find solace in knowing that others have faced similar challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;6. Exercise Patience and Perseverance&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frustration with God can be an opportunity for growth in patience and perseverance. Remember that faith is not always about immediate results but about trusting in God's faithfulness and remaining steadfast in our commitment to Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Addressing our frustration with God is crucial for our spiritual well-being and growth. Unresolved frustrations can lead to bitterness, doubt, and distance in our relationship with Him. By understanding the root causes of our frustration and seeking resolution through prayer, studying Scripture, and surrendering our desires to God, we can experience renewed peace, trust, and a deeper relationship with Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you ever experienced frustration with God? What were the circumstances that led to this frustration? Reflect on how it affected your relationship with Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can reflecting on the character of God and His promises help alleviate feelings of frustration?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider a specific area of frustration in your life right now. How can you surrender your desires and align your heart with God's will in this situation?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seek out a trusted Christian friend or mentor who can support you in your frustrations. Share your struggles and seek their guidance and prayers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember, frustration with God is a common experience, but it is essential to address it with humility, trust, and a willingness to seek understanding. As we surrender our frustrations to God and align our hearts with His purposes, we can find peace and grow deeper in our relationship with Him.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/Our Response to God/Honest Questions"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Testing God: The Ultimate Guide to Strengthening Your Faith</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/test-god/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-06-24T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-06-24T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-06-24:/test-god/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Testing God: Understanding Acceptable and Unacceptable Approaches&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Testing God is a concept that is discussed in the Bible, and it is important to understand the acceptable and unacceptable ways in which we can test God. One example of an acceptable kind of testing God can be found in the book of Malachi, where God invites His people to test Him in tithes and offerings. On the other hand, there is an unacceptable kind of testing that is rooted in doubt and demands something of God to prove Himself. In this article, we will explore these two types of testing in more detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Acceptable Testing: Tithes and Offerings&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the book of Malachi, God challenges His people to bring the whole tithe into the storehouse and test Him in this matter. He promises that if they do so, He will open the floodgates of heaven and pour out so much blessing that there will not be enough room to store it. This invitation from God to test Him in tithes and offerings is unique in the Bible. The Hebrew word used for "test" in this verse means to examine, scrutinize, or prove. It is similar to how gold is tested with fire to prove its quality. Just as gold is proven through testing, God invites His people to test Him in tithes and offerings to see His faithfulness in response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This acceptable kind of testing is based on faith. It requires trusting in God's promises and acting accordingly. By giving out of faith in who God is, He proves Himself to be faithful. It is important to note that this testing is specific to tithes and offerings and should not be applied to other areas of our relationship with God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Unacceptable Testing: Doubt and Demanding Signs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there are instances where it is acceptable to test God, there are also examples of testing that are considered unacceptable. One such example can be found in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Deuteronomy/6/Deuteronomy-6-16.html"&gt;Deuteronomy 6:16&lt;/a&gt;, where God commands Israel not to put Him to the test as they did at Massah. This kind of testing is characterized by doubt and a demand for signs or proof from God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An illustration of this unacceptable testing can be seen when Jesus was tempted by Satan in the wilderness. Satan challenged Jesus to prove that He was the Son of God by throwing Himself down from the highest point of the temple. Satan even quoted Scripture to support his challenge, but Jesus responded by quoting &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Deuteronomy/6/Deuteronomy-6-16.html"&gt;Deuteronomy 6:16&lt;/a&gt;, stating that we should not put the Lord our God to the test. Jesus understood that it was not appropriate to manipulate situations or demand signs from God to prove Himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This kind of testing is rooted in doubt and a lack of trust in God's faithfulness. It involves trying to coerce God into fulfilling His promises by manipulating circumstances. It is important for us to accept God's Word by faith without requiring signs or demanding proof from Him. We need to trust in His promises and rely on His faithfulness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Israelites' Testing at Massah&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To further understand the concept of unacceptable testing, let's explore the occasion where the Israelites tested God at Massah, as recorded in Exodus 17. As the Israelites were journeying towards the Promised Land, they camped at a place where there was no water. Instead of trusting in God's provision, they immediately grumbled against God and quarreled with Moses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their lack of trust in God was evident in their accusations towards Moses, questioning why he had brought them out of Egypt only to let them die of thirst. The Israelites' doubt and fear overtook them, leading them to conclude that God had abandoned them. They questioned His reliability because He was not meeting their expectations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This example highlights how doubt and lack of faith can lead us to test God in an unacceptable way. Instead of trusting in His provision and remaining faithful, the Israelites allowed their circumstances to shake their belief in God's faithfulness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0OaCeSsW1Ik" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The Role of Faith in Testing God&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key difference between acceptable and unacceptable testing lies in faith. &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/11/Hebrews-11-1.html"&gt;Hebrews 11:1&lt;/a&gt; defines faith as confidence in what we hope for and assurance about what we do not see. Acceptable testing is an expression of faith, where we trust in God's promises and act accordingly. It involves obedience and a willingness to take risks based on our belief in who God is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unacceptable testing, on the other hand, is driven by doubt and demands for signs or proof from God. It lacks true faith and reflects a lack of trust in His faithfulness. Instead of accepting His Word and trusting in His promises, it seeks to manipulate situations or coerce God into proving Himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the concept of testing God is important because it shapes our relationship with Him. Acceptable testing allows us to experience God's faithfulness as we trust in His promises and act in obedience. It deepens our faith and strengthens our relationship with Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the contrary, unacceptable testing can damage our relationship with God. It reflects a lack of trust and a misunderstanding of His character. It can lead to disappointment, doubt, and a distorted view of who God truly is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By discerning between acceptable and unacceptable testing, we can cultivate a healthy and vibrant relationship with God based on faith, trust, and obedience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reflect on your own approach to testing God. Are there areas where you have tested Him out of doubt or demanded signs from Him? How can you shift your perspective to one of faith and trust?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider the role of obedience in testing God. How does obedience demonstrate our faith in Him? In what ways can you actively obey His Word and trust in His promises?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take a moment to thank God for His faithfulness. Recall instances where He has proven Himself trustworthy and faithful in your life. How can you continue to cultivate a deeper trust in Him?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Bible, God is often referred to as Father. This title signifies the close relationship between God and His children. As followers of Christ, we are called children of God. The apostle John writes in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-John/3/1-John-3-1.html"&gt;1 John 3:1&lt;/a&gt;, “See what great love the Father has …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Father God&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Bible, God is often referred to as Father. This title signifies the close relationship between God and His children. As followers of Christ, we are called children of God. The apostle John writes in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-John/3/1-John-3-1.html"&gt;1 John 3:1&lt;/a&gt;, “See what great love the Father has lavished on us, that we should be called children of God! And that is what we are! The reason the world does not know us is that it did not know Him.” In this passage, John wants us to observe and appreciate the incredible love that the Father has bestowed upon us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;God's Lavish Love&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The term "lavished" used by John implies an action and the extent of God's love. It expresses astonishment and admiration at the abundant love that the Father pours out on His children. It's important to note that God's fatherhood is eternal; He has always been the Father of Jesus Christ, and through Jesus, He becomes our Father. Through our faith in Jesus Christ, we receive the Father's love and are adopted into His family, becoming children of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As children of God, we have the privilege of being heirs and co-heirs with Christ (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/8/Romans-8-17.html"&gt;Romans 8:17&lt;/a&gt;). We share in the inheritance of all that God has promised. This is not a promise for some future time; it is a present reality. We are already God's children, enjoying all the rights and privileges that come with our adoption. Our status as His children allows us to experience His love, provision, and protection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Knowing God as Our Father&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tyYsGH0oPbg" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be called children of God means that we have an experiential knowledge of Him as our Father. We have a personal relationship with Him. Just as earthly fathers love, provide for, and protect their children, our heavenly Father does the same for us. He disciplines us when necessary for our benefit, that we may grow in holiness and be transformed into His likeness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As children of God, we are described in various ways in Scripture. We are heirs of God and co-heirs with Christ, sharing in the inheritance of eternal life (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/8/Romans-8-17.html"&gt;Romans 8:17&lt;/a&gt;). We are holy priests, set apart to serve God and represent Him to the world (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-Peter/2/1-Peter-2-5.html"&gt;1 Peter 2:5&lt;/a&gt;). We are new creations, transformed by the power of the Holy Spirit (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/2-Corinthians/5/2-Corinthians-5-17.html"&gt;2 Corinthians 5:17&lt;/a&gt;). And we are partakers of the divine nature, having been given new life through our union with Christ (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/2-Peter/1/2-Peter-1-4.html"&gt;2 Peter 1:4&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding and embracing our identity as children of God is crucial for our faith journey. It reminds us of the depth of God's love for us and the privilege we have as His beloved children. It also helps us to have confidence in approaching God, knowing that He is our loving Father who desires a close relationship with us. Recognizing ourselves as children of God also shapes how we view ourselves and others, treating them with love, compassion, and respect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reflect on the love that the Father has lavished on you as His child. How does this reality impact your daily life?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consider the significance of being called a child of God. How does it change your perspective on your purpose and worth?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does knowing God as your heavenly Father shape your relationship with Him? How does it influence the way you relate to other believers?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we meditate on the truth that we are children of God, let us embrace our identity and live in the fullness of His love and grace. May we grow in our understanding of what it means to be called His children and walk in the knowledge that He is our heavenly Father who loves us unconditionally.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/Our Response to God/Knowing God"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>7 Divine Characteristics of God Unveiled: A Christian Perspective</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/characteristics-of-god/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-05-25T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-05-25T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-05-25:/characteristics-of-god/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Characteristics of God&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bible reveals the characteristics of God to believers, giving us insight into His nature and qualities. As mortal beings, it can be challenging for us to fully comprehend the power and majesty of the God who created everything. The prophet Isaiah reminds us, “For my thoughts …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Characteristics of God&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bible reveals the characteristics of God to believers, giving us insight into His nature and qualities. As mortal beings, it can be challenging for us to fully comprehend the power and majesty of the God who created everything. The prophet Isaiah reminds us, “For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways” (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/55/Isaiah-55-8.html"&gt;Isaiah 55:8&lt;/a&gt;). In this article, we will explore three key characteristics of God and how believers should respond to each.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Holiness of God&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most important attributes of God is His holiness. The Bible describes God as holy in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/6/Isaiah-6-3.html"&gt;Isaiah 6:3&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Revelation/4/Revelation-4-8.html"&gt;Revelation 4:8&lt;/a&gt;, where it says, “Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God almighty, who was, and is, and is to come.” When we catch a glimpse of God's holiness in contrast to our own sinful nature, it brings us to a place of true repentance. Recognizing the consequences of sin and understanding that Jesus suffered on our behalf humbles us. We are silenced before the face of God's holiness, overwhelmed by the reverence such holiness demands. Job expressed this sentiment when he said, “I am unworthy—how can I reply to you? I put my hand over my mouth” (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Job/40/Job-40-4.html"&gt;Job 40:4&lt;/a&gt;). Understanding God's holiness leads us to appreciate His compassion (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/2-Corinthians/1/2-Corinthians-1-3.html"&gt;2 Corinthians 1:3&lt;/a&gt;), mercy (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/9/Romans-9-15.html"&gt;Romans 9:15&lt;/a&gt;), grace, and forgiveness (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/5/Romans-5-17.html"&gt;Romans 5:17&lt;/a&gt;) towards us. &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/130/Psalm-130-3.html"&gt;Psalm 130:3&lt;/a&gt;–4 acknowledges that if God kept a record of our sins, no one could stand before Him. However, because He offers forgiveness, we reverence Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Recognizing God's holiness helps us understand the seriousness of sin and our need for repentance and forgiveness. It also allows us to appreciate His compassion and mercy towards us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; How does understanding God's holiness impact your view of sin and the importance of repentance?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nxwzq1PJImM" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The Love of God&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God's love is perhaps His most endearing characteristic. Love necessitates a relationship, and from eternity past, the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit have existed in perfect relationship with one another. We were created in God's image to be in relationship with Him (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/3/Genesis-3-17.html"&gt;Genesis 3:17&lt;/a&gt;–18; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/1/Romans-1-19.html"&gt;Romans 1:19&lt;/a&gt;–20). God's love for us is so great that He sent His only Son, Jesus, to redeem us from our sins. The apostle John tells us, “This is how we know what love is: Jesus Christ laid down his life for us. And we ought to lay down our lives for our brothers and sisters” (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-John/3/1-John-3-16.html"&gt;1 John 3:16&lt;/a&gt;–19). Through Jesus, God provided a solution for our sin, taking on our punishment to satisfy His justice (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/1/John-1-1.html"&gt;John 1:1&lt;/a&gt;–5, 14, 29). At the cross, God's perfect love and perfect justice intersected. When we begin to grasp the depth of God's love for us, our response is one of humility, repentance, and reciprocal love. Like King David, we pray that God will create in us a pure heart and a steadfast spirit (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/34/Psalm-34-18.html"&gt;Psalm 34:18&lt;/a&gt;; 51:10, 17). Although God dwells in a high and holy place, He is also near to those who are humble in spirit (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/57/Isaiah-57-15.html"&gt;Isaiah 57:15&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Understanding and experiencing God's love transforms our hearts and motivates us to love Him and others in return.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; How does knowing that God loves you unconditionally impact your relationship with Him and others?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Sovereignty of God&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God's sovereignty is another crucial aspect of His character. He is eternal, existing from everlasting to everlasting (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/90/Psalm-90-2.html"&gt;Psalm 90:2&lt;/a&gt;). He is the source of all life (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/11/Romans-11-33.html"&gt;Romans 11:33&lt;/a&gt;–36) and is independent of His creation (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Acts/17/Acts-17-24.html"&gt;Acts 17:24&lt;/a&gt;–28). Throughout Scripture, faithful individuals like Abraham, Samuel, Isaiah, Daniel, and David acknowledged God as their Sovereign Lord. In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-Chronicles/29/1-Chronicles-29-10.html"&gt;1 Chronicles 29:10&lt;/a&gt;–13, David praises God, recognizing His greatness, power, glory, majesty, and splendor. Believers honor our Sovereign Lord who has redeemed us and willingly submit to Him (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/2-Peter/2/2-Peter-2-1.html"&gt;2 Peter 2:1&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/James/4/James-4-7.html"&gt;James 4:7&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Jude/1/Jude-1-4.html"&gt;Jude 1:4&lt;/a&gt;). King David beautifully captures the characteristics of God when he declares, “The Lord reigns, he is robed in majesty; the Lord is robed in majesty and armed with strength. The world is firmly established; it cannot be moved. Your throne was established long ago; you are from all eternity. . . . The Lord on high is mighty. Your statutes stand firm; holiness adorns your house for endless days, O Lord” (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/93/Psalm-93-1.html"&gt;Psalm 93:1&lt;/a&gt;–2, 4–5).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Recognizing God's sovereignty helps us trust in Him and surrender to His plans and purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; How does acknowledging God's sovereignty impact your faith and trust in Him?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many other characteristics of God revealed in the Bible. For example, God's faithfulness leads us to trust Him, His grace prompts gratitude, His power incites awe, and His knowledge encourages us to seek wisdom (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/James/1/James-1-5.html"&gt;James 1:5&lt;/a&gt;). Those who truly know God conduct themselves in holiness and honor (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-Thessalonians/4/1-Thessalonians-4-4.html"&gt;1 Thessalonians 4:4&lt;/a&gt;–5).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we consider these characteristics of God, it is important to respond appropriately. We should approach Him with reverence, humility, and gratitude. Just as Moses, Job, Isaiah, and John responded in awe and repentance when encountering God's glory, our hearts should also be filled with worship and submission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, the Bible provides insights into the characteristics of God. His holiness calls us to repentance and appreciation for His compassion and forgiveness. His love transforms our hearts and motivates us to respond in love towards Him and others. His sovereignty reminds us to trust in Him and surrender to His plans. Understanding these characteristics helps us develop a deeper relationship with God and live in alignment with His will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;May we continually seek to know God more deeply, responding to His character with reverence, humility, and love.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/Our Response to God/Seeking God"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Praise God: 7 Transformative Ways to Deepen Your Worship Experience</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/praise-god/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-05-25T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-05-25T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-05-25:/praise-god/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Praise God: A Call to Worship and Give Thanks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Praising God is an essential aspect of the Christian faith. It is a command found throughout the Bible, encouraging all living creatures to lift their voices in worship and thanksgiving to the Lord (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/150/Psalm-150-6.html"&gt;Psalm 150:6&lt;/a&gt;). In the Old Testament, there …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Praise God: A Call to Worship and Give Thanks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Praising God is an essential aspect of the Christian faith. It is a command found throughout the Bible, encouraging all living creatures to lift their voices in worship and thanksgiving to the Lord (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/150/Psalm-150-6.html"&gt;Psalm 150:6&lt;/a&gt;). In the Old Testament, there are three Hebrew words commonly translated as "praise," each with its own nuances. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first word is "yadah," which means "praise, give thanks, or confess." It encompasses the idea of acknowledging and expressing gratitude to God for His goodness and faithfulness. The second word is "zamar," which means "to sing praises." This word emphasizes the use of music and song in praising God. The third word is "halal," the root of "hallelujah," which means "to praise, honor, or commend." Halal carries a sense of exuberant praise and adoration for the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book of Psalms is a treasure trove of songs filled with praises to God. For example, Psalm 9 declares, "I will be glad and rejoice in you; I will sing the praises of your name, O Most High" (verse 2). &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/18/Psalm-18-3.html"&gt;Psalm 18:3&lt;/a&gt; affirms that God is worthy of praise, while &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/21/Psalm-21-13.html"&gt;Psalm 21:13&lt;/a&gt; combines praise for who God is and His mighty power. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psalm 150 is particularly focused on praising God. It uses the term "praise" thirteen times in just six verses. The psalm begins by instructing us to praise God everywhere, both in His sanctuary and in the heavens. The psalmist explains that we should praise Him for His acts of power and His surpassing greatness. In verses 3-6, different instruments, dance, and everything that has breath are encouraged as ways to offer our praise to the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the New Testament, we see examples of people praising Jesus. In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/21/Matthew-21-16.html"&gt;Matthew 21:16&lt;/a&gt;, those witnessing Jesus riding on a donkey into Jerusalem praised Him. A leper in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/8/Matthew-8-2.html"&gt;Matthew 8:2&lt;/a&gt; bowed before Jesus, and in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/28/Matthew-28-17.html"&gt;Matthew 28:17&lt;/a&gt;, the disciples worshiped Him after His resurrection. Jesus accepted this praise because He is God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The early church also engaged in times of praise and worship. &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Acts/2/Acts-2-42.html"&gt;Acts 2:42-43&lt;/a&gt; describes how the first church in Jerusalem devoted themselves to worship. At Antioch, the church leaders prayed, worshiped, and fasted when Paul and Barnabas were called into missionary work (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Acts/13/Acts-13-1.html"&gt;Acts 13:1-5&lt;/a&gt;). Many of Paul's letters contain extended sections of praise to the Lord, such as &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-Timothy/3/1-Timothy-3-14.html"&gt;1 Timothy 3:14-16&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Philippians/1/Philippians-1-3.html"&gt;Philippians 1:3-11&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking ahead to eternity, we find that all of God's people will join in eternal praise. &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Revelation/22/Revelation-22-3.html"&gt;Revelation 22:3&lt;/a&gt; tells us that in the absence of sin, God's servants will worship Him forever. Our worship on earth serves as preparation for the ultimate celebration of praise that will take place in eternity with the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/f2oxGYpuLkw" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Praising God is not just a religious duty; it is a response to who God is and what He has done for us. It is an expression of our love, adoration, and gratitude towards our Creator and Savior. Through praise, we acknowledge His sovereignty, goodness, and faithfulness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Engaging in regular times of praise can also have a profound impact on our spiritual lives. It helps us shift our focus from ourselves to God, reminding us of His greatness and lifting our spirits. Praise has the power to transform our perspective and draw us closer to God as we cultivate a heart of gratitude.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can you incorporate praise into your daily life? Consider setting aside specific times for worship and thanksgiving, whether individually or with others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reflect on the reasons why God is worthy of your praise. Consider His attributes, His work in your life, and His faithfulness throughout history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In what ways can you use your talents and resources to praise God? Find creative ways to express your worship, such as through music, art, writing, or acts of service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember that praising God is not limited to a specific location or activity. It is a lifestyle of acknowledging and honoring Him in all aspects of our lives. May our hearts be filled with gratitude as we join the chorus of praise that resounds throughout eternity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Praise the LORD! Praise God in his sanctuary; praise him in his mighty heavens! Praise him for his mighty deeds; praise him according to his excellent greatness!" - &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/150/Psalm-150-1.html"&gt;Psalm 150:1-2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Knowing God is a fundamental aspect of the Christian faith. It is through our relationship with God that we find meaning and purpose in life. While our desire to know others is inherent, the most important person to know is our Creator. Jesus taught that eternal life is not just a span of time; it is a relationship with God (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/17/John-17-3.html"&gt;John 17:3&lt;/a&gt;). The key to truly knowing God lies in understanding what He has revealed about Himself in the Bible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Acknowledging Our Sinfulness&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to truly know God, we must first acknowledge our sinfulness. We are all sinful beings, falling short of the standard of holiness required to commune with God. The Bible tells us that we have exchanged the glory of the immortal God for created things (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/1/Romans-1-23.html"&gt;Romans 1:23&lt;/a&gt;). To bridge this gap, we need to recognize our sin and repent of it (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Acts/3/Acts-3-19.html"&gt;Acts 3:19&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Turning to Jesus&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turning from sin requires turning to Jesus Christ, the only Savior from sin. Salvation is found in Jesus alone (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Acts/4/Acts-4-12.html"&gt;Acts 4:12&lt;/a&gt;). We receive Jesus by faith, believing in His name and accepting Him into our lives (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/1/John-1-12.html"&gt;John 1:12&lt;/a&gt;). Through His death and resurrection, Jesus provided forgiveness for our sins, and He is the way to a personal knowledge of God (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/14/John-14-6.html"&gt;John 14:6&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Looking to Jesus&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus revealed who God is through His life and teachings. In knowing God, we must look to Jesus as our example. He said, "Anyone who has seen me has seen the Father" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/14/John-14-9.html"&gt;John 14:9&lt;/a&gt;). Every work that Jesus did was in obedience to the Father, and every word He spoke was straight from the Father (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/5/John-5-19.html"&gt;John 5:19&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/12/John-12-49.html"&gt;John 12:49&lt;/a&gt;). To truly know God, we must know Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Role of the Bible&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bible plays a crucial role in knowing God. It is through the Scriptures that we have God's revelation of His character, promises, and will. The Bible portrays God as compassionate, gracious, slow to anger, abounding in love and faithfulness (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/86/Psalm-86-15.html"&gt;Psalm 86:15&lt;/a&gt;). It also reveals God as mighty, awesome, impartial, and incorruptible (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Deuteronomy/10/Deuteronomy-10-17.html"&gt;Deuteronomy 10:17&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-Timothy/1/1-Timothy-1-17.html"&gt;1 Timothy 1:17&lt;/a&gt;). Reading and studying the Bible helps us understand who God is and what He desires from us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Obedience and Good Works&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Truly knowing God involves a commitment to obey what we read in the Scriptures. We were saved unto good works (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Ephesians/2/Ephesians-2-10.html"&gt;Ephesians 2:10&lt;/a&gt;), and as we obey the Lord, we become part of God's plan to reveal Himself to the world. Jesus emphasized the importance of loving God with all our being and loving our neighbor as ourselves (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/22/Matthew-22-37.html"&gt;Matthew 22:37-40&lt;/a&gt;). Through our actions, we can reflect God's character and bring His love into the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QPywCD-TSd0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The Role of Prayer, Fellowship, Worship, and the Holy Spirit&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to reading the Bible and obeying its teachings, knowing God involves other practices. Prayer allows us to communicate with God and deepen our relationship with Him. Fellowship with other believers provides support, encouragement, and accountability in our journey of faith. Sincere worship allows us to express our love and adoration for God. Walking in the Spirit enables us to experience the indwelling presence of God and the assurance that we are His children (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/8/Romans-8-15.html"&gt;Romans 8:15-16&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowing God is essential for our spiritual growth and well-being. It is through our relationship with Him that we find purpose, hope, and eternal life. By knowing God, we can experience His love, receive His guidance, and have confidence in His promises. Knowing God also transforms our lives, enabling us to live according to His will and make a positive impact on the world around us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can you deepen your knowledge of God? Consider reading the Bible regularly, praying, and seeking fellowship with other believers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reflect on the importance of obedience in truly knowing God. How can you align your actions with God's teachings?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consider how your relationship with God impacts your daily life. How can you reflect God's character and love in your interactions with others?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, knowing God is a lifelong journey that begins with acknowledging our sinfulness, turning to Jesus Christ for salvation, and looking to Him as our example. The Bible plays a crucial role in understanding who God is and what He desires from us. Obedience to His teachings and engaging in practices such as prayer, fellowship, worship, and walking in the Spirit further deepen our knowledge of God. Through knowing God, we find purpose, hope, and eternal life.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/Our Response to God/Knowing God"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Overcoming Disappointment with God: Rekindling Faith and Hope</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/disappointment-with-god/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-05-19T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-05-19T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-05-19:/disappointment-with-god/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Disappointment with God&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disappointment with God is a common experience that many people go through. It is important to understand that feeling disappointed with God does not necessarily mean that there is something wrong with our faith or that we have sinned. Disappointment is a natural response when our hopes, desires, and expectations are not met.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;God's Sovereignty and Goodness&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, we may feel disappointed with God when He doesn't act in the way we expect Him to. However, it is crucial to remember that God is sovereign and His ways are higher than ours. He has control over every aspect of the universe and every decision made by every person. &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/46/Isaiah-46-11.html"&gt;Isaiah 46:11&lt;/a&gt; says, "From the east I summon a bird of prey; from a far-off land, a man to fulfill my purpose. What I have said, that will I bring about; what I have planned, that will I do." Even the smallest details are part of His foreordained plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we may not always understand why God acts or doesn't act in certain situations, we can trust that He has a purpose and His actions are ultimately for our benefit. &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/8/Romans-8-28.html"&gt;Romans 8:28&lt;/a&gt; assures us, "And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him, who have been called according to his purpose." Even if we don't understand His plan, we can have confidence that He is working all things together for our good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mUAo1pYA5lI" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Aligning Our Will with God's Will&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One way to avoid disappointment with God is to align our wills with His and submit to His plans. Jesus set an example for us when He prayed in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/22/Luke-22-42.html"&gt;Luke 22:42&lt;/a&gt;, "Not my will but yours be done." When we surrender our own desires and submit to God's will, we can find contentment even in the midst of challenging circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The apostle Paul also learned the secret of contentment in all situations. In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-Timothy/6/1-Timothy-6-6.html"&gt;1 Timothy 6:6-10&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Philippians/4/Philippians-4-11.html"&gt;Philippians 4:11-12&lt;/a&gt;, he speaks about being content with whatever God brings his way. Paul trusted in God's goodness and believed that everything God allowed in his life was for his good and God's glory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding disappointment with God is crucial because it affects our relationship with Him. When we are disappointed, we may question His goodness or doubt His sovereignty. However, by recognizing that disappointment is a natural part of the human experience and aligning our will with His, we can find peace and contentment in our relationship with God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have you ever experienced disappointment with God? How did it affect your faith?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can aligning your will with God's will help you find contentment in your relationship with Him?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reflect on times when you have seen God's faithfulness in your life, even when things didn't go as you expected.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take time to pray and surrender your desires to God, asking Him to help you align your will with His.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reverence for God is the deep honor and respect that is both felt within the heart and demonstrated outwardly. It is the response we have towards the awesome power and majesty of the Lord God Almighty. Reverence is not just a feeling, but it also involves our actions and attitudes towards God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Old Testament Perspective&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Old Testament, God taught the Israelites how to show proper reverence through the giving of laws related to purity, holiness, and worship. This was necessary because sinful humanity does not naturally know how to worship a holy God with reverence and awe. God's presence dwelt with Israel in the Ark of the Covenant, and they were instructed not to touch it as an act of reverence. The Holy of Holies inside the tabernacle also required the highest level of reverence. Disobeying God's command about entering the Holy of Holies resulted in instant death. These strict rules were intended to define holiness and impress upon mankind the necessity for reverence in the presence of the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The New Testament Perspective&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In New Testament Christianity, reverence for God is demonstrated by our willingness to die to self and obey His commands. Jesus taught His disciples to begin their prayers with "Our Father, who is in heaven, hallowed be your name." This reminds us to treat the name of God with reverence and not use it casually or irreverently. Reverence for God is also displayed through living a life that takes seriously His hatred of sin and understanding the coming judgment for those who refuse to repent. Pursuing holiness because He is holy is another way we demonstrate reverence for God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;True Worship&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;True worship is a demonstration of reverence for God. Jesus taught that true worship involves both spirit and truth. Worshipping in spirit means that our hearts are abandoned before the Lord, willing to obey everything He has said. Worshipping in truth means that our minds are engaged and filled with a biblical understanding of God's nature. True worship is not limited to an emotional experience or confined to a specific song. It is a lifestyle of knowing God and serving Him. To worship God the way He deserves, we must align our hearts with His and seek to obey Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Modern Perspective&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7Iw5BeQt2nM" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reverence for God is often missing in modern Christianity. There is a tendency to have a casual, "Jesus-is-my-buddy" attitude that downplays the holiness, power, and righteous wrath of God. It is important to remember that reverence does not refer to God as "The Big Guy in the Sky" or "The Man Upstairs." Instead, true reverence recognizes who God truly is and honors Him accordingly. Even the thief on the cross, after realizing who Jesus was, rebuked the other thief for his irreverence and acknowledged Jesus as the King.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reverence for God matters because it acknowledges the greatness and holiness of our Creator. It reminds us that we are not to take God lightly or treat Him casually. Reverence calls us to live lives that are set apart, pursuing holiness and obedience to His commands. It also helps us understand the seriousness of sin and the need for repentance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can you demonstrate reverence for God in your daily life?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are there any areas in your life where you have been treating God casually or irreverently? How can you change that?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why is it important to have a proper understanding of God's holiness and power when approaching Him in worship?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reflect on how knowing God more deeply can lead to a greater reverence for Him.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consider the words you use when talking about God. Do they reflect reverence and honor?&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Faith in God involves trusting Him based on a true understanding of who He is, as revealed in the Bible. It is not simply believing that God exists, but also committing to live according to His principles. Genuine faith in God must be based on accepting Him as He has revealed Himself in Scripture, without picking and choosing the attributes we prefer. Faith in God is not a blind leap without evidence or contrary to evidence; rather, it is trust in God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What is Faith in God?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Faith in God has several components. The first is acknowledging that He exists. However, mere belief in God's existence is not enough, as even demons believe in God (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/James/2/James-2-19.html"&gt;James 2:19&lt;/a&gt;). The second element of faith in God is commitment. True faith in God results in action, demonstrating a changed life (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/James/2/James-2-26.html"&gt;James 2:26&lt;/a&gt;). But commitment alone is not sufficient either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For faith in God to be genuine, we must accept Him as He has revealed Himself in Scripture. We cannot create our own version of God by accepting only the attributes we like and rejecting the ones we don't. Any religion not based on the Bible is essentially a designer religion with a designer god. True faith in God must accept the triune nature of the God revealed in the Bible, including the deity and personality of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/j3zuVzUs0PI" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Faith vs. Science&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is often confusion regarding the nature of faith, with some viewing it as belief without evidence or contrary to evidence. However, faith in God is not a blind leap; rather, it is trust. In a similar way, scientific atheists have faith in science. When an atheist uses the scientific method to develop and take medicine, they are exercising faith in their data and trusting that the medicine will work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Faith is not the opposite of doubt; doubt can exist within faith itself. It is possible to exercise faith while still having uncertainties. Faith is a commitment to trust even when there are questions. Some people may trust God intuitively, having been raised in a Christian home and witnessing His work. Others may come to faith after carefully examining the evidence for God. Regardless of how faith is arrived at, it is the mark of genuine faith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding and having faith in God is foundational to the Christian life. It is not merely about believing that God exists, but about trusting Him and committing to live according to His principles. Faith in God is not blind, but based on a true understanding of who He is as revealed in Scripture. It is important to accept God as He has revealed Himself, without picking and choosing the attributes we prefer. True faith in God requires accepting the triune nature of God as revealed in the Bible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does your understanding of faith in God align with what has been discussed?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What aspects of God's character or attributes do you struggle with accepting?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In what ways can you demonstrate your commitment and trust in God through your actions?&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seeking the face of God is a concept that appears throughout Scripture, urging believers to pursue a deeper connection with the divine. While we cannot physically see God's face, seeking His face means seeking His presence and developing an intimate relationship with Him. In this article, we will explore the significance of seeking God's face and how it can transform our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Meaning Behind Seeking God's Face&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the context of the Bible, the Hebrew word for "face" is often translated as "presence." When we seek God's face, we are seeking His presence in our lives. This call to seek God's face was often issued to His people when they had turned away from Him and needed to return to Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as a person's face reveals their character and emotions, seeking God's face allows us to know Him more intimately. Our human condition and worldly desires often obscure God's holy character from us. That is why the Lord encourages us to continually seek His face. He desires to be our constant companion in every aspect of our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Seeking God's Face in Prayer&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Approaching God in prayer is one way we seek His face. The psalmist asks, "Who may ascend the mountain of the LORD? Who may stand in his holy place?" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/24/Psalm-24-3.html"&gt;Psalm 24:3&lt;/a&gt;). The answer lies in having clean hands and a pure heart, trusting in God alone. When we seek God's face through prayer, we receive His blessings and vindication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;True worship involves seeking God's face. As Christians, our journey is devoted to seeking God's presence and favor. The Lord wants us to humbly and trustingly seek His face in our prayers and through studying His Word. This pursuit requires intimacy with Him, just as looking intently into someone's face conveys closeness. Seeking God's face is about developing an intimate relationship with Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Blessing of God's Smiling Face&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having God's face smile upon us is a powerful expression of His blessing, love, and favor. In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Numbers/6/Numbers-6-25.html"&gt;Numbers 6:25&lt;/a&gt;, we read, "May the LORD smile on you and be gracious to you." When we draw close to God and seek His face, we experience His shining favor. It is important to note that seeking God's face is not solely about presenting our wants and needs to Him. He already knows what we need (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/6/Matthew-6-7.html"&gt;Matthew 6:7&lt;/a&gt;–8, 32–33). Instead, seeking God's face means desiring to know His character and wanting Him—His presence—more than anything else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seeking God's face is not merely a religious duty; it is an invitation to experience a transformative relationship with our Creator. When we seek His face, we open ourselves up to His presence, guidance, and blessings in our lives. It is through seeking God's face that we can truly know Him intimately and grow in our faith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5Fwg2d4jwyQ" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How often do you intentionally seek God's face in prayer? What steps can you take to prioritize seeking His presence in your daily life?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In what ways have you experienced God's shining favor when you have drawn close to Him? Reflect on those moments and consider how they have impacted your faith journey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are there any distractions or worldly desires that are hindering your ability to seek God's face? Take time to identify and surrender these obstacles to Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How does seeking God's face differ from seeking His blessings or material things? Consider how you can shift your focus from seeking things to seeking a deeper connection with Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, seeking the face of God is an invitation to pursue His presence and develop an intimate relationship with Him. Through prayer, worship, and a desire to know His character, we can experience His blessings and favor in our lives. As we prioritize seeking God's face, we will find ourselves transformed and drawn closer to Him, ready to receive the abundant life He has in store for us.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/Our Response to God/Seeking God"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Discover 7 Proven Ways to Find God in Your Daily Life</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/find-god/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-04-26T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-04-26T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-04-26:/find-god/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Finding God: A Journey of Faith&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Recognizing …&lt;/h3&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Finding God: A Journey of Faith&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The phrase "finding God" can have different meanings for different individuals. It encompasses various interpretations, including finding a religious affiliation or experiencing a spiritual transformation. Ultimately, finding God involves a change in attitude and behavior, leading to a deeper connection with the divine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Recognizing Our Longing for God&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many individuals throughout history have earnestly sought to find God. Job, in his distress, expressed his desire to find God and present his case before the Judge of the universe (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Job/23/Job-23-3.html"&gt;Job 23:3&lt;/a&gt;). The sons of Korah also yearned to find God, comparing their longing for Him to a deer's thirst for water (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/42/Psalm-42-1.html"&gt;Psalm 42:1&lt;/a&gt;–2).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As humans, we naturally long for meaning and purpose in life. This longing often manifests as a deep desire to connect with something greater than ourselves. The Bible acknowledges this innate longing and reveals that our search for God is not in vain. In fact, God commands us to seek Him and promises that those who diligently seek Him will find Him (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/55/Isaiah-55-6.html"&gt;Isaiah 55:6&lt;/a&gt;–7).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/o_4s8HbDgto" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Finding God Through Jesus Christ&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the Bible, finding God ultimately involves accepting Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior. Jesus Himself declared, "I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/14/John-14-6.html"&gt;John 14:6&lt;/a&gt;). Through faith in Christ, we experience a spiritual transformation. As the apostle Paul wrote, "Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, the new creation has come: The old has gone, the new is here!" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/2-Corinthians/5/2-Corinthians-5-17.html"&gt;2 Corinthians 5:17&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we find God through Jesus Christ, we enter into a personal relationship with Him. This relationship is characterized by love, grace, and forgiveness. It is through Jesus that we can experience reconciliation with our Creator and receive the gift of eternal life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Seeking God's Mercy and Goodness&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bible assures us that when we seek God, we will find Him, and He will shower us with His mercy and goodness. The psalmist declares, "Those who know your name trust in you, for you, Lord, have never forsaken those who seek you" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/9/Psalm-9-10.html"&gt;Psalm 9:10&lt;/a&gt;). Another psalmist encourages us to seek God's face, promising that those who do so will experience His presence and blessings (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/22/Psalm-22-26.html"&gt;Psalm 22:26&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God desires to be found by us. He is not far off or distant but is near to all who call on Him. As the Apostle Paul taught, God orchestrates circumstances in our lives so that we would seek Him and perhaps reach out for Him and find Him, for He is intimately involved in our lives (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Acts/17/Acts-17-27.html"&gt;Acts 17:27&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finding God is a significant pursuit in the life of a believer. It goes beyond mere religious observance or adherence to a set of rules. It involves a personal encounter with the living God and a transformation of the heart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through finding God, we discover our true purpose and identity. We experience His love, grace, and forgiveness, which brings healing and restoration to our lives. Finding God also empowers us to live out the Christian life and fulfill the calling He has placed on each of us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What does it mean for you personally to "find God"? How has this journey impacted your life?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does seeking God differ from seeking other things in life? How can we prioritize our search for God above all else?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reflect on instances where you have experienced God's mercy and goodness as a result of seeking Him. How did these encounters strengthen your faith?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, finding God is a transformative journey that involves recognizing our longing for Him, accepting Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior, and seeking His mercy and goodness. It is through this journey that we can experience a deep and meaningful relationship with our Creator. May we continue to seek God wholeheartedly and allow Him to guide us in every aspect of our lives.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/Our Response to God/Seeking God"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Fear God: The Ultimate Guide to Embracing Reverence and Faith</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/fear-god/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-04-14T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-04-14T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-04-14:/fear-god/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;The Fear of God: Understanding Reverence and Awe&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fear of God is a concept that holds different meanings for believers and non-believers. For those who do not have faith, the fear of God is associated with the judgment and eternal separation from Him. However, for Christians, the fear of God is rooted in reverence and awe. It is crucial to develop a deep understanding of who God is and to recognize His holiness, righteousness, and justice. This reverence and awe are what motivate us to surrender ourselves to the Creator of the Universe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Beginning of Knowledge&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Proverbs/1/Proverbs-1-7.html"&gt;Proverbs 1:7&lt;/a&gt; states that "The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge." This verse emphasizes that true wisdom can only be attained by understanding who God is and developing a reverential fear of Him. This fear serves as the foundation for walking in His ways, serving Him wholeheartedly, and loving Him genuinely. The fear of God encompasses more than just respecting Him; it involves recognizing how much He abhors sin and fearing His judgment, even in the life of a believer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Understanding God's Discipline&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/12/Hebrews-12-5.html"&gt;Hebrews 12:5-11&lt;/a&gt; provides insight into God's discipline for believers. Although His discipline is an expression of love, it is still a fearful thing to experience. As children, our fear of discipline from our parents often prevented us from engaging in wrongdoing. Similarly, we should fear God's discipline and strive to live in a way that pleases Him. While believers need not be scared of God, we should maintain a reverence for Him that significantly impacts our daily lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FSccRcek3tI" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The Promise of God's Love&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Christians, we have no reason to be scared of God because He has promised that nothing can separate us from His love (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/8/Romans-8-38.html"&gt;Romans 8:38-39&lt;/a&gt;). Additionally, He assures us that He will never leave us or forsake us (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/13/Hebrews-13-5.html"&gt;Hebrews 13:5&lt;/a&gt;). The fear of God, therefore, involves respecting Him, obeying His commands, submitting to His discipline, and worshiping Him in awe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the fear of God is essential for believers as it shapes our relationship with Him. By acknowledging His holiness and justice, we gain wisdom and knowledge. Furthermore, recognizing the consequences of sin and fearing God's judgment motivates us to live according to His will. The fear of God serves as a guiding principle for our actions and decisions, leading us to a life of obedience and reverence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider the significance of the fear of God in your own life. How does it impact your relationship with Him? How can you cultivate a deeper reverence and awe for God? Reflect on the ways in which the fear of God influences your choices and actions. How can you align your life more closely with His will? Take time to meditate on &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Proverbs/1/Proverbs-1-7.html"&gt;Proverbs 1:7&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/12/Hebrews-12-5.html"&gt;Hebrews 12:5-11&lt;/a&gt;, allowing these verses to deepen your understanding of the fear of God.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/Our Response to God/Worshiping God"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Honor God: 7 Powerful Ways to Deepen Your Spiritual Connection</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/honor-god/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-04-12T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-04-12T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-04-12:/honor-god/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Honor God&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To honor God is to give Him the respect, praise, and value that He deserves. In the Bible, the concepts of glory and honor are closely related when it comes to honoring God. The word "glory" refers to something that has inherent, intrinsic worth, while the word "honor" refers to the perceived value or esteem placed on someone or something. When we glorify God, we reflect His character and acknowledge His infinite worth. Honoring God originates from our hearts and involves recognizing His significance in our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What is Glory?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glory can be seen as a mirror that accurately reflects what is truly there. When we accurately reflect the character of God, we glorify Him. We bring Him glory by demonstrating His glorious character or deeds through our words and actions. As human beings created in the image of God, we also have glory. Our glory comes from being made in the image of the all-glorious One. By modeling the character of Jesus, we showcase His attributes and bring glory to God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What is Honor?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honor, on the other hand, refers to the value we personally place on someone or something. It originates from our hearts and is based on considering someone's position or contributions significant. The Bible commands us to honor various individuals based on their positions, such as our fathers and mothers, the elderly, and those who rule over us. When we honor God, we demonstrate a high regard for Him and reflect His glory back to Him through praise and worship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How Can We Honor and Glorify God?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tI-x0ixLLw0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Bible provides us with many ways to honor and glorify God. Living lives devoted to Him, being sexually pure, giving of our income, seeking Him in everything we do, and delighting in Him are all ways in which we can honor and glorify God. However, it is important to note that simply outwardly honoring God is not enough. God desires honor that comes from our hearts. He wants us to have a genuine love and devotion for Him, not just empty words or actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the concepts of honoring and glorifying God is essential for Christians because it helps us develop a deeper relationship with Him. By recognizing God's infinite worth and reflecting His character, we align ourselves with His purposes and invite His presence into our lives. Honoring God also shapes our interactions with others, as we are called to honor those in positions of authority and those around us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take some time to reflect on how you currently honor and glorify God in your life. Are there areas where you can grow in giving Him the respect and value He deserves? Consider the importance of having a genuine heart of honor and how that can impact your relationship with God and others.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/Our Response to God/Worshiping God"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Discover 7 Powerful Ways to Know God Personally</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/know-god/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-04-04T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-04-04T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-04-04:/know-god/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Getting to Know God: A Journey of Faith and Understanding&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Introduction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Christians, we have a deep desire to know God better. The good news is that God has made Himself known to us.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Introduction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Christians, we have a deep desire to know God better. The good news is that God has made Himself known to us. In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/1/Romans-1-19.html"&gt;Romans 1:19-20&lt;/a&gt;, we learn that God's invisible qualities, His eternal power and divine nature, are clearly seen in the world He created. Therefore, we are without excuse when it comes to recognizing the existence of God. However, knowing God on a personal level requires more than mere acknowledgment; it requires faith, study, prayer, and fellowship with other believers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1. The Importance of Faith&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first step in getting to know God better is to have faith in Jesus Christ. In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/6/John-6-38.html"&gt;John 6:38&lt;/a&gt;, Jesus explains that He was sent from God. By accepting Jesus as our Savior and being born again through the power of the Holy Spirit, we can begin to truly learn about God, His character, and His will for our lives. Without faith, we cannot understand the things of God because they are discerned only through the Spirit (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-Corinthians/2/1-Corinthians-2-14.html"&gt;1 Corinthians 2:14&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/strong&gt;: Faith is the foundation upon which our relationship with God is built. It is through faith in Jesus Christ that we can have a personal connection with God and experience His love and grace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It&lt;/strong&gt;: How has your faith in Jesus Christ impacted your relationship with God? How has it transformed your life?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2. Studying God's Word&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study of God's Word, the Bible, is paramount to knowing Him better. &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/4/Hebrews-4-12.html"&gt;Hebrews 4:12&lt;/a&gt; describes the Word as alive and powerful. As we dive into Scripture, we have the opportunity to encounter God's truth and wisdom. Just as newborn babies crave pure spiritual milk to grow, we should crave the nourishment of God's Word in order to grow spiritually (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-Peter/2/1-Peter-2-2.html"&gt;1 Peter 2:2-3&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/strong&gt;: The Bible is God's revelation to us, and by studying it, we can gain a deeper understanding of His character, His promises, and His plan for our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It&lt;/strong&gt;: How can you prioritize regular Bible study in your life? What resources or methods can you use to help you dive deeper into Scripture?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;3. Walking in the Spirit&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To know God better, we must surrender to the guidance of the Holy Spirit. &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Ephesians/5/Ephesians-5-15.html"&gt;Ephesians 5:15-21&lt;/a&gt; instructs us to be filled with the Spirit and live in a way that honors God. When we submit to the Spirit's leading, He empowers us to live a life that reflects God's character and will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/strong&gt;: Walking in the Spirit is essential for growing closer to God and experiencing His transformative work in our lives. It enables us to live in alignment with His desires and purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It&lt;/strong&gt;: In what areas of your life do you need to rely more on the Holy Spirit's guidance? How can you cultivate a greater sensitivity to His leading?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;4. The Power of Prayer&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prayer is an integral part of knowing God better. Through prayer, we communicate with God, express our praise and gratitude, and seek His guidance and provision. &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/8/Romans-8-26.html"&gt;Romans 8:26&lt;/a&gt; reminds us that even when words fail us, the Holy Spirit intercedes for us in prayer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gaS59ddVkao" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/strong&gt;: Prayer allows us to develop a deeper relationship with God as we spend time with Him and align our hearts with His desires. It is through prayer that we experience His presence and receive His comfort and strength.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It&lt;/strong&gt;: How can you prioritize regular prayer in your life? Are there specific areas or concerns that you need to bring before God in prayer?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;5. Fellowship with Other Believers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Christian life was not meant to be lived alone. Fellowship with other believers is essential for our spiritual growth and understanding of God. Through the preaching of God's Word and the godly counsel of fellow believers, we can learn more about God and His ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/strong&gt;: Fellowshipping with other believers provides accountability, encouragement, and opportunities for learning and growth. It strengthens our faith and deepens our understanding of God's truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It&lt;/strong&gt;: How can you actively engage in fellowship with other believers? How can you contribute to a community of believers that encourages one another in their faith?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting to know God better is a lifelong journey that requires faith, study, prayer, and fellowship. By accepting Jesus as our Savior, studying His Word, walking in the Spirit, praying regularly, and engaging in fellowship with other believers, we can deepen our relationship with God and experience the transformative power of His presence in our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember that knowing God is not merely an intellectual pursuit; it is a personal encounter with the living God who loves us unconditionally. As we seek to know Him better, may we be open to His leading, eager to learn from Him, and committed to living a life that honors and glorifies Him.&lt;/p&gt;

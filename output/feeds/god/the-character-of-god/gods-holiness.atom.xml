&lt;p&gt;When it comes to understanding God's attributes, there are two important considerations: which attributes are most important for us to understand, and whether some attributes are more important for God Himself. From a human perspective, our understanding of God's qualities must come in a certain order because we are not infinite or perfect. However, when we look at the attributes of God, we find that they are all equally perfect and unchangeable. There is no practical difference in their importance to God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Equally Perfect Attributes of God&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order for a being to be truly "infinitely" perfect, they must be perfect in all qualities. For example, a being cannot have all possible power without also having all possible knowledge. All of God's attributes exist in cooperation with one another and cannot be ranked on a scale of importance. They are equally perfect, infinite, and ranked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BtUNFuUpXu8" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The Starting Point: God's Holiness&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a human perspective, the starting point for understanding who God is His holiness. God's holiness means that He is set apart from mankind in a radical and fundamental way. He is perfection without any unrighteousness. Without recognizing this uniqueness, none of His other qualities make sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Building Blocks for Understanding God's Attributes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we can fully grasp certain attributes of God that are more connected to human experience, we need to understand those that are "beyond" mankind. God's holiness, sovereignty, and omnipotence serve as crucial foundations for our understanding of His other qualities such as love and justice. Although none of God's qualities are "more" or "less" present than the others due to His perfection, we can arrange them in a logical order to help our limited human minds comprehend Him. This logical order starts with His holiness, extends to His power (omnipotence, sovereignty), and then to His personality (love, mercy, justice).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding God's attributes is crucial for our relationship with Him. It allows us to grasp a glimpse of His nature and character, and it shapes our understanding of His actions and dealings with humanity. Recognizing God's holiness helps us approach Him with reverence and awe. Appreciating His sovereignty and power enables us to trust in His control over all things. Understanding His love, mercy, and justice helps us relate to Him on a personal level and comprehend His plans for our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reflecting on God's attributes can lead to a deeper relationship with Him. Consider how your understanding of God's holiness has shaped your perception of Him. How does recognizing His sovereignty and power impact your trust in Him? How does knowing His love, mercy, and justice influence your relationship with Him and others? Take time to meditate on these attributes and their significance in your walk with God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, while all of God's attributes are equally perfect and important to who He is, our understanding of them must come in a certain order due to our limited human perspective. Starting with God's holiness as the foundation, we can build upon that understanding to grasp His power and personality. Reflecting on these attributes deepens our relationship with God and shapes our understanding of His nature and character. Let us continually seek to know Him more fully by exploring His attributes and drawing near to Him.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/The Character of God/God’s Holiness"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Unveiling the Divine Glory: 7 Powerful Insights for Christian Believers</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/glory-of-god/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-08-26T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-08-26T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-08-26:/glory-of-god/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;The Glory of God&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The glory of God is a concept that refers to the beauty and majesty of His character. It is not a physical or material beauty but rather a reflection of all that He is. Unlike the glory of man, which fades away, the glory of God …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;The Glory of God&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The glory of God is a concept that refers to the beauty and majesty of His character. It is not a physical or material beauty but rather a reflection of all that He is. Unlike the glory of man, which fades away, the glory of God is eternal and unchanging. In the Old Testament, the glory of God was often accompanied by supernatural phenomena such as fire, clouds, and earthquakes. Moses once asked God to show him His glory, and in response, God revealed His goodness. However, because no mortal can fully comprehend or withstand the fullness of God's glory, Moses was hidden in a cleft in the rock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the New Testament, the glory of God is manifested in Jesus Christ. He is described as the "one and only Son" who came from the Father, full of grace and truth. Through Jesus, the glory of God became approachable and knowable. Jesus performed miracles that revealed His glory and promised to return someday with power and great glory. The redemption of Israel and the natural world also demonstrate God's glory. The psalmist declares that the heavens declare the glory of God, and all creation proclaims His work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heaven itself is referred to as "glory," and when believers die, they are received into glory in God's presence. In the future New Jerusalem, the city will be illuminated by the glory of God without the need for sun or moon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7zL9BfEcUdc" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is important to note that God will not share His glory with anyone or anything else. Scripture condemns idolatry as people exchange the glory of God for images made to look like created beings. Only God is eternal, perfect, and worthy of worship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the glory of God helps us grasp His nature and character. It reminds us that He is far greater than we can comprehend and deserves our worship and reverence. Recognizing God's glory also helps us put our own achievements and pride in perspective. The glory of man is temporary and fades away, but the glory of God is eternal and unchanging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take a moment to reflect on the beauty and majesty of God's character. How does recognizing His glory impact your worship and reverence for Him? Consider the transient nature of human glory compared to the eternal glory of God. How does this perspective shape your priorities and values?&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/The Character of God/God’s Holiness"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Divine Sovereignty Unveiled: Embracing God's Ultimate Authority</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/god-is-sovereign/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-07-07T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-07-07T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-07-07:/god-is-sovereign/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;God's Sovereignty: Understanding His Rule and Control&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;God’s sovereignty is a foundational principle in Christian theology. It is widely accepted among mainstream Christian beliefs that God is preeminent in power and authority. His sovereignty is a natural consequence of His omniscience, omnipotence, and omnipresence. However, the extent to which God exercises His sovereignty over the wills of men is a subject of debate within Christianity. In this article, we will explore the concept of God's sovereignty, examining both its scope and implications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What Does it Mean for God to Be Sovereign?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we speak of the sovereignty of God, we mean that He rules over the entire universe. The Bible describes God as all-powerful, all-knowing, outside of time, and responsible for the creation of everything. These divine attributes set the minimum boundary for God’s sovereign control in the universe. In other words, nothing in the universe occurs without God’s permission. He has the power and knowledge to prevent anything He chooses to prevent. Therefore, anything that happens must, at the very least, be “allowed” by God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, the Bible also portrays God as offering humanity choices and holding them accountable for their actions. This suggests that not all things that occur are directly caused by God. The existence of sin itself demonstrates that there are actions that take place which are not the direct result of God's will. This reality of human volition sets the maximum boundary for God’s sovereign control over the universe. There is a point at which God chooses to allow things to happen that He does not directly cause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Complexity of Divine Sovereignty&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept of divine sovereignty can sometimes be oversimplified. It is important to recognize that just because an event does not appear to be directly driven by God does not mean He is not sovereign. To illustrate this point, let's consider an analogy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UnXw_QO4OaM" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine a man placing an ant in a bowl. The man has complete control over the ant's movements. While the ant may try to crawl out of the bowl, the man has the power to prevent it from doing so. However, the man may choose to let the ant crawl away for reasons of his own, even though he has the ability to keep it inside the bowl. In this analogy, the man's sovereignty over the ant is not in doubt, regardless of whether he actively holds it in or allows it to leave. Similarly, God has the ability to take action and intervene in any situation, but He often chooses to act indirectly or allow certain things for reasons known only to Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Understanding God's Will and Permissive Will&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God's sovereignty means that He is absolute in authority and unrestricted in His supremacy. Everything that happens is ultimately allowed by God, even if certain specific things are not what He would prefer. This holds true because of His permissive will. God's permissive will refers to His decision to allow human free will and the consequences that result from it. It is essential for true sovereignty that God respects mankind's freedom of choice just as much as His ability to enact His will wherever and however He chooses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding God's sovereignty has significant implications for our faith and relationship with Him. Recognizing that God is sovereign reminds us of His absolute authority and power over all creation. It instills confidence that He is in control, even when circumstances seem chaotic or difficult. Moreover, acknowledging that God allows free will highlights the importance of our choices and personal responsibility before Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, grasping the concept of divine sovereignty can bring comfort and assurance in times of struggle or suffering. Knowing that nothing happens without God's permission helps us trust that He has a purpose even in our pain. It reminds us that His plans are ultimately for our good, even if we cannot comprehend them fully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does the concept of God's sovereignty impact your understanding of prayer and seeking His guidance in your life?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reflect on a time when you struggled to reconcile the existence of evil with God's sovereignty. How did understanding His permissive will help you make sense of it?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consider the balance between God's control and human responsibility. How does this tension shape your understanding of free will and accountability?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, God's sovereignty is a central aspect of Christian theology. While there may be debates regarding the extent of His control over the wills of men, all Christians agree that God is preeminent in power and authority. His sovereignty means that He has the power, wisdom, and authority to do anything He chooses within His creation. Although God often allows things to happen indirectly or permits human choices, everything that occurs is ultimately allowed by Him. Understanding God's sovereignty helps us trust in His control, recognize our own responsibility, and find comfort in difficult circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/The Character of God/God’s Holiness"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Unveiling the Holiness of God: A Divine Revelation for Believers</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/holy-god-holiness-of-god/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-06-23T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-06-23T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-06-23:/holy-god-holiness-of-god/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;The Holiness of God: Understanding His Majestic Being and Moral Purity&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The holiness of God is a foundational concept in Christian theology. It refers to the unparalleled majesty of His incomparable being and His blameless, faultless, and unblemished moral purity. When we speak of God's holiness, we are acknowledging that He is set apart from everything else in existence. In this article, we will explore the holiness of God, its significance, and its implications for our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Two Meanings of Holy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Christian theology, the word "holy" has two meanings. First, it refers to God Himself as the epitome of perfection and righteousness. God is eternal, preeminent, omnipotent, omniscient, and omnipresent. He is beyond full human comprehension and our language lacks the superlatives necessary to justly describe Him. We are drawn to Him for His unequaled goodness and majesty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, holy also refers to something or someone that has been set apart for God's use or separated from the common. For example, in the Old Testament, there were vessels in the temple that were set aside for use by God's priests. When Belshazzar profaned these holy artifacts by using them for idol worship, he committed sacrilege.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Ambivalence of Human Response&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The holiness of God brings about a mixture of attraction and dread in the hearts and minds of mortal man. We are drawn to Him because He is our Creator who made us in His image. However, as inherently flawed creatures, we also cower in fear when faced with the all-revealing light of His majestic glory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/6/Isaiah-6-1.html"&gt;Isaiah 6:1&lt;/a&gt;–5, the prophet Isaiah stood in awestruck wonder before the Lord. Yet, at the same time, he recoiled in reverential fear because of his own unworthiness and sinfulness. This ambivalence of attraction and dread is also seen in the experiences of other biblical figures such as Daniel and the apostle John.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Holiness of God Revealed&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout the Bible, we see the holiness of God revealed in various ways. The Scriptures affirm that there is none holy like the Lord and that there is no rock like our God. God's actions are just, true, and deserving of our reverential fear and respect. He alone is holy, and all nations will come to worship Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters: Awe and Reverence&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the holiness of God should lead us to a place of awe and reverence. We should be in awe of His greatness, goodness, and perfection. Our hearts should be filled with reverence for His holiness and the fact that He is set apart from all that is sinful and evil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1GDph15KeII" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recognizing God's holiness also helps us understand our own need for redemption. In the presence of God's holiness, we become acutely aware of our own sinfulness and unworthiness. It is only through Jesus Christ, who was sinless and gave His life as a sacrifice for our sins, that we can be made right with God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It: Reflecting God's Holiness&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As believers, we are called to reflect the holiness of God in our lives. While we will not achieve sinless perfection on this side of eternity, our conduct should align with His moral purity. We are called to be salt and light in the world, preserving godly values and pointing others towards Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Living a holy life means being set apart from the sinful behaviors and attitudes prevalent in society. It means seeking to imitate Christ's example of love, compassion, forgiveness, and righteousness. By doing so, we bring honor to God and become agents of transformation and renewal in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Holiness of God and Our Relationship with Him&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The holiness of God should not only evoke reverence and awe but also draw us into an intimate relationship with Him. Despite our sinfulness, God desires to have a personal relationship with us. Through faith in Jesus Christ, we are adopted as His children and can call Him "Father." It is through the redemptive work of Jesus that we can approach God with confidence and receive His forgiveness and grace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, the holiness of God is a foundational concept in Christian theology. It refers to His unparalleled majesty and faultless moral purity. Recognizing God's holiness should lead us to awe and reverence, as well as an understanding of our need for redemption. As believers, we are called to reflect His holiness in our lives and to have an intimate relationship with Him. May we continually seek to know and understand the holiness of God as we grow in our faith and walk with Him.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/The Character of God/God’s Holiness"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Is God Perfect? Exploring the Divine Perfection in Christian Faith</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/is-god-perfect/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-06-18T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-06-18T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-06-18:/is-god-perfect/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Is God Perfect?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perfect means "without flaw." According to the Bible, God is perfect in every way. He is flawless and without any imperfections. In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Deuteronomy/32/Deuteronomy-32-4.html"&gt;Deuteronomy 32:4&lt;/a&gt;, it is written, "He is the Rock, his works are perfect, and all his ways are just. A faithful God who does …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Is God Perfect?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perfect means "without flaw." According to the Bible, God is perfect in every way. He is flawless and without any imperfections. In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Deuteronomy/32/Deuteronomy-32-4.html"&gt;Deuteronomy 32:4&lt;/a&gt;, it is written, "He is the Rock, his works are perfect, and all his ways are just. A faithful God who does no wrong, upright and just is he."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;God's Character&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God's character is the sum total of all the qualities that make Him who He is. The Bible describes these qualities as His attributes. For example, it says that "God is love" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-John/4/1-John-4-16.html"&gt;1 John 4:16&lt;/a&gt;). This means that love is not just something God possesses, but it is His very nature. God perfectly defines love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God is also faithful. He keeps His promises and remains constant even when we are unfaithful to Him (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/2-Timothy/2/2-Timothy-2-13.html"&gt;2 Timothy 2:13&lt;/a&gt;). His faithfulness sustains us even in difficult times. The perfect faithfulness of God means that He remains the same regardless of circumstances or human behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God is also just. All hints of fairness or righteousness found in us have their completeness in a perfect God. Even His forgiveness is just because sin has already been punished in Christ (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-John/1/1-John-1-9.html"&gt;1 John 1:9&lt;/a&gt;). The perfection of God's justice means that He pronounces those who are in Christ as "not guilty."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;God's Word&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QPywCD-TSd0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Bible teaches us that God's Word is truth (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/17/John-17-17.html"&gt;John 17:17&lt;/a&gt;). It equates God's written Word with absolute truth. Any idea or claim that contradicts God's Word is not true. Since God is perfect, every word He speaks is also perfect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;God's Actions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, God's actions may puzzle us or seem difficult to understand. It's important to remember that Moses, who knew the Lord face to face, wrote that "God does no wrong" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Deuteronomy/32/Deuteronomy-32-4.html"&gt;Deuteronomy 32:4&lt;/a&gt;). When we evaluate God's actions from our limited perspective, we unintentionally place ourselves in judgment over Him. We need to trust that God is always right and relinquish our perceived right to judge and approve of His methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is worth noting that when God saves us, the Holy Spirit begins to transform our imperfections. God's goal is for us to become more like His Son, Jesus Christ. While we may never attain absolute perfection in this fallen world, God wants us to pursue it. The pursuit itself is valuable because it aligns with what God desires for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding God's perfection has significant implications for our faith and relationship with Him. Recognizing God as perfect helps us trust in His character, knowing that He is always faithful and just. It also assures us that His Word is true and reliable. Embracing the pursuit of perfection aligns us with God's purposes for our lives and encourages us to imitate Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does recognizing God's perfection impact your trust in Him?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In what ways can you pursue a life of greater conformity to the image of Christ?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does understanding God's perfection affect your understanding of justice?&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The throne of God is a concept found in the Bible that symbolizes God's transcendence, dignity, and sovereign rule. Although the throne of God is often described in physical terms, it is important to understand that these descriptions are anthropomorphisms—figures of speech used to help us …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Throne of God&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The throne of God is a concept found in the Bible that symbolizes God's transcendence, dignity, and sovereign rule. Although the throne of God is often described in physical terms, it is important to understand that these descriptions are anthropomorphisms—figures of speech used to help us comprehend the incomprehensible nature of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What Is the Throne of God?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In various biblical passages, references to the throne of God can be found. For example, &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/5/Matthew-5-34.html"&gt;Matthew 5:34&lt;/a&gt; states that heaven is God's throne, echoing the words of &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/66/Isaiah-66-1.html"&gt;Isaiah 66:1&lt;/a&gt;. These references emphasize the heavenly and transcendent nature of God's existence. It is crucial to recognize that the throne of God is not a physical object but rather a symbol used to convey His magnificence and exalted position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Symbolic Nature of the Throne&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an incorporeal being, God does not possess a physical body and does not literally "sit" on a throne. Instead, descriptions of the divine throne are meant to help us grasp God's character and attributes. Just as phrases like "the hand of God" or "the eyes of God" are figurative expressions, references to the throne serve as anthropomorphic language used to communicate divine concepts in terms we can understand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Biblical Descriptions of the Throne&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/6/Isaiah-6-1.html"&gt;Isaiah 6:1&lt;/a&gt;, the prophet Isaiah sees a vision of the Lord "high and exalted, seated on a throne." This vision illustrates the splendor and exaltation of God's being, rather than describing a literal seat. Similar depictions can be found in visions experienced by prophets such as Ezekiel and John.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EkLX57i0Suc" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/2-Chronicles/18/2-Chronicles-18-18.html"&gt;2 Chronicles 18:18&lt;/a&gt;, Micaiah describes a vision in which spirit beings stand in attendance within God's throne room. This vision parallels &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Job/1/Job-1-6.html"&gt;Job 1:6&lt;/a&gt;, where angelic beings gather before God to give an account. These passages highlight the heavenly court and the authority of God as the ultimate judge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Jesus and the Throne of God&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ascension of Jesus to heaven is described in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/12/Hebrews-12-2.html"&gt;Hebrews 12:2&lt;/a&gt;, stating that He "sat down at the right hand of the throne of God." This signifies Jesus' exalted position and His ultimate authority alongside God. It indicates that there is no higher place than heaven, and Jesus holds a place of honor next to God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Throne as a Symbol of Judgment and Mercy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bible also depicts the throne of God as a symbol of judgment. &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/9/Psalm-9-7.html"&gt;Psalm 9:7&lt;/a&gt; declares, "He has prepared His throne for judgment," while Revelation 20 describes a great white throne where the final judgment will take place. However, God's throne also represents mercy and grace. &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/4/Hebrews-4-16.html"&gt;Hebrews 4:16&lt;/a&gt; encourages believers to approach God's throne of grace with confidence, seeking mercy and finding grace in times of need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Worship Around the Throne&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John's vision in Revelation includes scenes where heavenly beings sing praises to the One who occupies the throne. The book describes a "new song" sung in worship (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Revelation/14/Revelation-14-3.html"&gt;Revelation 14:3&lt;/a&gt;), and praise surrounding the throne is depicted as glorious (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/66/Psalm-66-2.html"&gt;Psalm 66:2&lt;/a&gt;). Only those who have been redeemed through Christ can stand before God's throne (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Revelation/14/Revelation-14-5.html"&gt;Revelation 14:5&lt;/a&gt;), emphasizing the privilege reserved for His children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Future Bowing Before God's Throne&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Philippians/2/Philippians-2-9.html"&gt;Philippians 2:9&lt;/a&gt;–11 reveals that one day, all creation will bow before the majesty of God's throne. The regal beings surrounding the throne will lay their crowns before Him, acknowledging His worthiness to receive glory, honor, and power (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Revelation/4/Revelation-4-10.html"&gt;Revelation 4:10&lt;/a&gt;–11).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the symbolism behind the throne of God helps us grasp the transcendence and sovereignty of our Creator. It reminds us that God is ultimately in control and holds the highest authority. The throne of God signifies both judgment and mercy, reminding us of the importance of seeking His grace and forgiveness. Recognizing the honor bestowed upon Jesus as He sits at the right hand of the throne of God deepens our understanding of His role in our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Think About It&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider the significance of the throne of God in your own faith journey. How does understanding the symbolism behind it impact your view of God's sovereignty and authority? How does knowing that Jesus sits at the right hand of God's throne affect your understanding of His role as Savior and Lord? Take a moment to reflect on the privilege of approaching God's throne of grace with confidence, seeking His mercy and finding His abundant grace in times of need.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/The Character of God/God’s Holiness"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Holy Holy Holy: Exploring the Divine Triune Nature</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/holy-holy-holy/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-05-14T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-05-14T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-05-14:/holy-holy-holy/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;The Holiness of God&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The phrase "holy, holy, holy" appears in both the Old and New Testaments of the Bible. It is spoken or sung by heavenly creatures in the visions of Isaiah and John. But what does it mean for God to be holy? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God's holiness is one of …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;The Holiness of God&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The phrase "holy, holy, holy" appears in both the Old and New Testaments of the Bible. It is spoken or sung by heavenly creatures in the visions of Isaiah and John. But what does it mean for God to be holy? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God's holiness is one of His essential attributes that sets Him apart from all other beings. It is more than just His perfection or sinless purity; it is the essence of His "other-ness," His transcendence. In fact, holiness is not something that humans possess inherently; we only become holy in relationship to Christ. Only through Christ do we become righteous in God's eyes. God's holiness embodies the mystery of His awesomeness and causes us to marvel at His majesty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Isaiah's Vision&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the book of Isaiah, the prophet has a firsthand witness of God's holiness. In his vision, Isaiah sees heavenly creatures called seraphim crying out, "Holy, holy, holy is the LORD Almighty." Even though Isaiah was a prophet and a righteous man, he becomes aware of his own sinfulness and despairs for his life because of the overwhelming holiness of God. Even the angels in God's presence cover their faces and feet with their wings as a sign of reverence and awe. This shows us that we should approach God with profound reverence and not rush thoughtlessly into His presence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;John's Vision&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the book of Revelation, the apostle John has a similar vision of the throne of God. He sees living creatures around the throne crying out, "Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God Almighty." John describes these creatures giving glory, honor, and reverence to God continually around His throne. Unlike Isaiah, John does not fall down in terror and awareness of his own sinful state. This may be because John had already encountered the risen Christ at the beginning of his vision. Through Christ, we can approach the throne of grace with confidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Triune Nature of God&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xIzr5IgAaKc" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The repetition of the phrase "holy, holy, holy" not only expresses the supreme holiness of God but also reflects the triune nature of God. In Christianity, God is understood to exist in three persons: the Father, the Son (Jesus Christ), and the Holy Spirit. Each person is equal in holiness and majesty. Jesus Christ is referred to as the Holy One who was resurrected and exalted at the right hand of God. The Holy Spirit, by His very name, emphasizes the importance of holiness in the essence of the Godhead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Consistency Throughout Scripture&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The visions of Isaiah and John highlight that God is consistent throughout the Old and New Testaments. Often, people think of the God of the Old Testament as a God of wrath and the God of the New Testament as a God of love. However, Isaiah and John present a unified picture of our holy, majestic, awesome God who does not change. This consistency reassures us that God's holiness is eternal and unchanging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding and acknowledging the holiness of God is crucial for our relationship with Him. It helps us recognize our own sinfulness and our need for redemption through Jesus Christ. Recognizing God's holiness also inspires reverence and awe in His presence, reminding us to approach Him with humility and respect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Think About It&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does recognizing God's holiness impact your view of yourself and your relationship with Him?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In what ways can you cultivate reverence and awe in your worship and daily life?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can you deepen your understanding of God's holiness through studying Scripture and seeking His presence?&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;God's transcendent nature is a fundamental aspect of His being. To transcend means to exist above and independent from something, to rise above and surpass it. In this sense, God is the only truly transcendent being. He is the "LORD God Almighty" who created all things on earth, beneath the earth, and in the heavens above. Despite being the creator and sustainer of all things, God exists above and independent from them. He upholds all things by His mighty power, yet He is upheld by Himself alone. The entire universe exists in Him and for Him, bringing Him glory, honor, and praise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Unknown and Unknowable God&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a transcendent being, God is both unknown and unknowable. However, He continually seeks to reveal Himself to His creation. It is a paradox that the unknown seeks to be known. Being transcendent, God is the incomprehensible Creator who exists outside of space and time. Therefore, He is unknowable and unsearchable. Our finite minds and thoughts are far beneath His, making it impossible for us to understand or experience Him through our own will or reasoning. Yet, God desires us to seek Him and know Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Scriptures acknowledge the unfathomable wisdom and knowledge of God, with His judgments and paths beyond our tracing out. No one can fully know the mind of the Lord or be His counselor. No one has ever given anything to God that He should repay them because everything comes from Him, through Him, and belongs to Him. The depth of God's wisdom is beyond measure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;God's Holiness and Righteousness&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another aspect of God's transcendent nature is His holiness and righteousness. Due to humanity's inclination towards sin and wickedness, we are unable to enter into God's presence. When Moses asked to see God's glory, He was told that no one could see God's face and live. The fullness of God's glory would be too much for any human to bear. Therefore, the complete revelation of God is reserved for the future, when all things will be seen as they are, and we will be in a condition to receive them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The prophet Isaiah recognized the need for God to remain separate from His creation. He acknowledged that all humans have become unclean, and even their righteous acts are like filthy rags. Our sins cause us to waste away, leading God to hide His face from us. His righteousness and holiness require Him to keep Himself separate from anything sinful, impure, unclean, or less than perfect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;God's Immanence&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite His transcendent nature, God also possesses immanence, which refers to His nearness. It is through His immanence that He chooses to draw near to His creation. This creates another paradox—God's transcendent nature strives to keep Him distant and remote from His creation, while His immanent nature works to draw Him near and sustain the universe. God's love for His creation is so great that it overshadows His transcendence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kQ1RA3W-FFA" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Jesus Christ, God broke through the barrier of sin and separation to draw all mankind into a close, personal relationship with Him. Through the indwelling power of the Holy Spirit, God chooses to dwell in the hearts and minds of His people. This miraculous act demonstrates God's immanence, as He personally draws near to His creation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding God's transcendent nature is crucial because it helps us recognize our limitations as finite beings trying to comprehend an infinite God. It humbles us, reminding us that we cannot fully understand or experience God through our own efforts. It also emphasizes the necessity of seeking a personal relationship with Him and relying on His revelation rather than our own reasoning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recognizing God's holiness and righteousness highlights the gravity of sin and the need for redemption. It reminds us that our sinful nature separates us from God, but through Jesus Christ, we can be reconciled to Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The understanding of God's immanence is essential for believers, as it assures us that God is not distant or remote but desires to have a personal relationship with each one of us. It encourages us to seek His presence and experience His love and guidance in our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does recognizing God's transcendent nature impact your understanding of His sovereignty and authority?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In what ways does understanding God's holiness and righteousness shape your view of sin and redemption?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reflect on how God's immanence affects your personal relationship with Him. How does it encourage you to seek His presence and rely on His guidance in your life?&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The statement "God is truth" refers to one of the moral attributes of God. It means that truth itself proceeds from the nature of God. While many things can have truth, only one thing can be the ultimate truth, which is God Himself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The statement "God is truth" refers to one of the moral attributes of God. It means that truth itself proceeds from the nature of God. While many things can have truth, only one thing can be the ultimate truth, which is God Himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yFwD3Dxng4s" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The Attributes of God&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The attributes of God can be categorized into nonmoral and moral attributes. Nonmoral attributes refer to aspects like eternality, infinity, and omnipotence. Moral attributes, on the other hand, include characteristics like truth. When we say "God is truth," we are acknowledging that truth is a moral attribute that stems from the nature of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Scripture Affirming God as Truth&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bible directly refers to God as truth in various places. Jesus Himself said, "I am the way, and the truth, and the life" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/14/John-14-6.html"&gt;John 14:6&lt;/a&gt;), and He also referred to the Holy Spirit as "the Spirit of truth" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/14/John-14-17.html"&gt;John 14:17&lt;/a&gt;; 15:26; 16:13). Additionally, &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/6/Hebrews-6-18.html"&gt;Hebrews 6:18&lt;/a&gt; states that it is impossible for God to lie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Understanding Truth in Scripture&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Bible, the Hebrew term for "truth" is emet, which encompasses meanings like "truth," "firmness," "stability," and "faithfulness." The Greek word for "truth" is aletheia, which denotes concepts such as "truth," "sincerity," "straightforwardness," or "reality." These terms, along with other attributes of God like His immutability (inability to change), infinity, and simplicity (cannot be partly anything), help us understand that God Himself is absolute truth. His truth is unchanging and reliable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Relationship Between Truth and Righteousness&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One often overlooked aspect of truth in Scripture is its synonymous relationship with righteousness. In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/2/Romans-2-8.html"&gt;Romans 2:8&lt;/a&gt;, Paul refers to those who "do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness." He further highlights the equality between unrighteousness and lies and righteousness and truth in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/3/Romans-3-5.html"&gt;Romans 3:5&lt;/a&gt;, 7. This reveals that God's moral attribute of truth is inseparable from His attribute of holiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding that God is truth has profound implications for our lives as Christians. It means that we can trust in the unchanging nature of God's truth. In a world where opinions and perspectives may vary, we have an anchor in the unchanging character of God. This truth serves as a guide for our decisions and actions, providing us with a solid foundation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider the significance of having a source of truth that is unwavering and reliable. How does knowing that God is truth impact your understanding of His Word? How does it influence the way you live your life? Reflect on how you can align yourself with God's truth in your thoughts, words, and actions.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/The Character of God/God’s Holiness"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Divine Revelation: God is Light - Unveiling the Ultimate Truth</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/god-is-light/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-04-01T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-04-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-04-01:/god-is-light/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;God is Light&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Bible, the concept of light is frequently used as a metaphor to describe God and His attributes. The phrase "God is light" appears in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-John/1/1-John-1-5.html"&gt;1 John 1:5&lt;/a&gt;, emphasizing the holiness and righteousness of God. This metaphorical use of light can be seen throughout the …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;God is Light&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Bible, the concept of light is frequently used as a metaphor to describe God and His attributes. The phrase "God is light" appears in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-John/1/1-John-1-5.html"&gt;1 John 1:5&lt;/a&gt;, emphasizing the holiness and righteousness of God. This metaphorical use of light can be seen throughout the scriptures. &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Proverbs/4/Proverbs-4-18.html"&gt;Proverbs 4:18&lt;/a&gt; symbolizes righteousness as the "morning sun," while &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Philippians/2/Philippians-2-15.html"&gt;Philippians 2:15&lt;/a&gt; compares blameless and pure believers to shining stars in the sky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Light is often associated with good works and righteousness. Jesus encourages His followers to let their light shine before others so that they may see their good deeds (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/5/Matthew-5-16.html"&gt;Matthew 5:16&lt;/a&gt;). In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/76/Psalm-76-4.html"&gt;Psalm 76:4&lt;/a&gt;, God is described as radiant with light. This depiction highlights the purity and goodness that emanate from His nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The contrast between light and darkness is another important aspect of this metaphor. Just as light represents righteousness, darkness symbolizes evil and sin. The Apostle John warns that if we claim to have fellowship with God but walk in darkness, we lie and do not live out the truth (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-John/1/1-John-1-6.html"&gt;1 John 1:6&lt;/a&gt;). In verse 5, it is stated that God is light, and in Him, there is no darkness at all. This emphasizes that God is completely holy and without any trace of sin or injustice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PSq0NMZw5wk" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Understanding that God is light implies that to truly know Him, we must also walk in the light. Believers who have a relationship with God are considered children of the light and are called to live in righteousness (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-Thessalonians/5/1-Thessalonians-5-5.html"&gt;1 Thessalonians 5:5&lt;/a&gt;). By partaking in God's divine nature, they have escaped the corruption caused by evil desires (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/2-Peter/1/2-Peter-1-4.html"&gt;2 Peter 1:4&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus, as the Son of God, also embodies this idea of light. He declares Himself as the "light of the world" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/8/John-8-12.html"&gt;John 8:12&lt;/a&gt;). Those who follow Him will never walk in darkness but will have the light of life. This statement implies that as Christians, we are meant to grow in holiness and mature in faith as we follow Jesus (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/2-Peter/3/2-Peter-3-18.html"&gt;2 Peter 3:18&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As children of the light, believers are called to reflect God's light into a world darkened by sin. This involves confessing our own sins and allowing God to shine His light through us. By doing so, we can expose the hidden things of darkness and reveal the truth (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/3/John-3-20.html"&gt;John 3:20&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding that God is light has significant implications for our relationship with Him and how we live our lives as Christians. It reminds us of God's holiness and righteousness, which should motivate us to pursue righteousness in our own lives. It also calls us to be a light in the world, sharing the truth of the Gospel and exposing the darkness of sin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does the metaphor of light help us understand God's character and attributes?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are some practical ways we can let our light shine before others?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In what ways can we reflect God's light into a world darkened by sin?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, the concept that "God is light" is a recurring metaphor in the Bible that highlights His holiness, righteousness, and goodness. Light represents righteousness and good works, while darkness symbolizes evil and sin. Believers are called to walk in the light, reflecting God's nature and living in righteousness. Jesus is described as the "light of the world," and as His followers, we are to grow in holiness and maturity by following Him. Understanding that God is light has profound implications for our relationship with Him and our mission to shine His light into a dark world.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/The Character of God/God’s Holiness"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry></feed>

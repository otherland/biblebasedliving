&lt;p&gt;In the Bible, we find accounts of God's direct interaction with people, performing miracles, speaking audibly, and revealing Himself in undeniable ways.

&lt;p&gt;In the Bible, we find accounts of God's direct interaction with people, performing miracles, speaking audibly, and revealing Himself in undeniable ways. However, many wonder why God seems hidden and silent today. In order to understand this apparent hiddenness, we need to consider several key points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1. Hiddenness Due to Sin and Unbelief&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One reason why God may seem hidden today is the presence of willful, unrepentant sin. The Bible tells us that when people cry out to the Lord but continue in their evil ways, He may hide His face from them (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Micah/3/Micah-3-4.html"&gt;Micah 3:4&lt;/a&gt;). Additionally, without faith, it is impossible to please God (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/11/Hebrews-11-6.html"&gt;Hebrews 11:6&lt;/a&gt;). Sometimes people fail to perceive evidence of God's presence because they refuse to believe (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/6/Mark-6-1.html"&gt;Mark 6:1-6&lt;/a&gt;). It becomes challenging to see when one's eyes remain closed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Recognizing the impact of sin and unbelief helps us understand why some may struggle to see or experience God's presence in their lives. It underscores the importance of repentance and faith as a means to perceive and encounter God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; Have you ever experienced a time when your unbelief or sinful choices hindered your ability to recognize God's presence? How did repentance and faith open your eyes?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2. Progressive Revelation in History&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Far from being entirely hidden, God has revealed Himself progressively throughout history. He used miracles and direct communication with individuals to unveil His character, provide instructions, and disclose His plans. However, these moments were interspersed with times of silence when new revelation was not forthcoming (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-Samuel/3/1-Samuel-3-1.html"&gt;1 Samuel 3:1&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God's first act of revelation was through creation itself. The wonders of the natural world serve as a constant reminder of His existence and display His attributes (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/1/Romans-1-20.html"&gt;Romans 1:20&lt;/a&gt;). Creation was God's initial declaration to humanity, demonstrating His power, sovereignty, and eternality. Following creation, God spoke directly to Adam and Eve, giving them commandments and warning them of the consequences of disobedience. He also promised to send a Savior to redeem mankind from sin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout history, God revealed Himself intermittently. He spoke to individuals like Noah and Moses, providing guidance and delivering miracles to authenticate His messengers. Miracles were also performed during Joshua's time, as well as during the ministries of Elijah and Elisha, to confirm the prophetic word and combat idolatry. However, between these times of divine intervention, generations passed without witnessing miracles or hearing the voice of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Understanding the concept of progressive revelation helps us see that God's plan for unfolding His truth was not continuous miraculous events or constant audible communication. It highlights the significance of different periods in history and the unique ways God chose to reveal Himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; Reflect on the various ways God has chosen to reveal Himself throughout history. How does this pattern of progressive revelation deepen your trust in His sovereignty?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;3. The Completed Canon of Scripture&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One reason why God may seem hidden today is that He has already completed His plan of revelation. The Bible is the finished product of God's progressive revelation to humanity (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Revelation/22/Revelation-22-18.html"&gt;Revelation 22:18&lt;/a&gt;). The Scriptures contain everything we need for doctrine, reproof, correction, and instruction in righteousness (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/2-Timothy/3/2-Timothy-3-16.html"&gt;2 Timothy 3:16&lt;/a&gt;). The Bible is sufficient in making us wise unto salvation through faith in Christ Jesus (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/2-Timothy/3/2-Timothy-3-15.html"&gt;2 Timothy 3:15&lt;/a&gt;). It is a reliable source of prophecy that we should pay close attention to (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/2-Peter/1/2-Peter-1-19.html"&gt;2 Peter 1:19&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Recognizing the completeness and sufficiency of Scripture helps us understand that we do not need additional miracles or revelations to validate the Bible. The Bible stands as the ultimate authority for our faith and practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; How does the understanding that the Bible is complete and sufficient affect your approach to seeking spiritual guidance and truth?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HndJGVB3C5I" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;4. The Role of the Holy Spirit&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While God may not be speaking audibly or providing new revelations today, the Holy Spirit still plays a crucial role in our lives as believers. The Spirit serves as our Comforter (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/14/John-14-16.html"&gt;John 14:16&lt;/a&gt;) and works in conjunction with our conscience to guide us. However, it's important to note that the Holy Spirit does not provide new revelations. Instead, He speaks to us through the written Word of God, which functions as the "sword of the Spirit" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Ephesians/6/Ephesians-6-17.html"&gt;Ephesians 6:17&lt;/a&gt;). The Holy Spirit reminds us of specific Scriptures when needed, illuminates our understanding of the Word, and empowers us to live according to its teachings (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/14/John-14-26.html"&gt;John 14:26&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Recognizing that the Holy Spirit's role is not to provide new revelations but to guide us through Scripture helps us avoid potential pitfalls of seeking extra-biblical revelations or claiming new knowledge not found in God's Word.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; In what ways have you experienced the guidance of the Holy Spirit through Scripture? How has this impacted your faith journey?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;5. Living by Faith, Not by Sight&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The prophet Habakkuk declares that "the just shall live by his faith" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Habakkuk/2/Habakkuk-2-4.html"&gt;Habakkuk 2:4&lt;/a&gt;). Rather than continually receiving miraculous signs, God expects His people to trust in what He has already done, search the Scriptures daily, and live by faith (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/16/Matthew-16-4.html"&gt;Matthew 16:4&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/20/John-20-29.html"&gt;John 20:29&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/2-Corinthians/5/2-Corinthians-5-7.html"&gt;2 Corinthians 5:7&lt;/a&gt;). Although there may be times when it seems that God is doing nothing, He remains the sovereign Lord of all creation, constantly working to fulfill His perfect plan. The book of Esther serves as a prime example of God's hidden working, where His hand is never mentioned but is evident from beginning to end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Understanding the call to live by faith encourages us to trust in God's sovereignty and faithfulness even in times when His presence may seem hidden. It underscores the importance of relying on His Word and maintaining a steadfast faith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; How has living by faith, rather than relying solely on visible signs or experiences, deepened your relationship with God?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;6. The Ultimate Purpose of God's Hiddenness&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we may not fully comprehend why God chooses to be "hidden" at times, we can trust that He has a purpose in it. It is through periods of apparent hiddenness that God often works in ways we cannot immediately perceive or understand. Just as He worked behind the scenes in Esther's story, God continues to work silently, orchestrating events according to His perfect plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Recognizing that God works even in His hiddenness helps us maintain trust in His sovereignty and understand that there are aspects of His plan beyond our immediate perception.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; In what ways have you witnessed God's silent work in your life or the lives of others? How does this strengthen your faith?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, while it may seem that God is hidden or silent today, we can find assurance in understanding the reasons behind His apparent hiddenness. Sin and unbelief can blind us to His presence, and throughout history, God has progressively revealed Himself at specific times. The completed canon of Scripture provides us with everything we need for faith and practice. The Holy Spirit guides us through the Word of God rather than providing new revelations. Living by faith helps us trust in God's sovereignty, even when He seems hidden. Ultimately, we can find comfort in knowing that even in apparent hiddenness, God is at work, fulfilling His perfect plan.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/The Character of God/How God Works"></category><category term="null"></category></entry><entry><title>'Unmasking the Cosmic Killjoy: Unlocking Joy and Freedom in Christ'</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/cosmic-killjoy/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-09-01T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-09-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-09-01:/cosmic-killjoy/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Cosmic Killjoy: Understanding God's Character&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we think of God, we may sometimes imagine Him as a strict, joyless figure who is constantly pointing out our faults and stifling any sense of pleasure or fun. This view of God as a cosmic killjoy is not only sad but also completely unbiblical. The God of the Bible is far from being a cold, disagreeable sourpuss. In fact, He is the one who restores us and gives us true joy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;God's Desire for Fullness of Life&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus Himself declared that He came so that we may have life to the full (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/10/John-10-10.html"&gt;John 10:10&lt;/a&gt;). This does not align with the image of a killjoy. Throughout the Bible, we see examples of what a life filled with joy looks like. One great example is the life of Jesus Himself. His first miracle was performed at a wedding feast, demonstrating that He valued celebration and joy (John 2). Children were drawn to Him, which suggests that He was not joyless but rather exhibited joy in His interactions with them (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/10/Mark-10-13.html"&gt;Mark 10:13-16&lt;/a&gt;). In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/7/Luke-7-34.html"&gt;Luke 7:34&lt;/a&gt;, Jesus even addresses the criticism that He was a glutton and a drunkard, highlighting His participation in life and His enjoyment of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;God Delights in Us and Provides Pleasure&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contrary to being a killjoy, God takes pleasure in things. In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Zephaniah/3/Zephaniah-3-17.html"&gt;Zephaniah 3:17&lt;/a&gt;, it is stated that God delights in us and even sings over us. He finds delight in His obedient children (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Deuteronomy/30/Deuteronomy-30-9.html"&gt;Deuteronomy 30:9&lt;/a&gt;) and delights in showing mercy (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Micah/7/Micah-7-18.html"&gt;Micah 7:18&lt;/a&gt;). Furthermore, God created the human body with the capacity to experience pleasure. Taste buds were part of His design, along with a wide variety of flavorful foods to satisfy our palates. The human eye was intricately designed by God to appreciate the beauty and wonder of colors. Additionally, God also designed the sexual organs, with their countless nerve endings, so that a married couple can experience the pleasure of their love. Pleasure was God's idea, demonstrating that He is far from being a killjoy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Celebrations and Festivals&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Old Testament is filled with instructions for celebrations and festivals. These feasts served as important reminders of God's faithfulness and provided glimpses of who the Messiah would be. They were also times of outright celebration, which would not be the case if God were a killjoy. These feasts were opportunities for God's people to come together, enjoy good food, and experience joy in His presence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Joy in Serving and Creativity&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, as Christians, we may mistakenly believe that joy can only be found in reading the Bible, meditating, or serving others. While it is true that we can experience joy in these activities, joy is not limited to them alone. God created us to experience fellowship, recreation, and creativity. We were made to delight in being His children, using the skills He has given us, and welcoming the pleasures He offers. The Westminster Shorter Catechism correctly states that "Man's chief end is to glorify God and enjoy him forever." This means that our purpose is not solely focused on reading the Bible or serving but also on finding joy in all aspects of life that are aligned with God's will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Understanding Boundaries&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to note that while God provides us with many sources of joy and pleasure, there are certain types of "pleasure" that He opposes. The sad truth is that we live in a fallen world where what society often deems pleasurable may not be pleasing to God. Activities such as promiscuous sex or drunkenness are not condoned by God (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Galatians/5/Galatians-5-19.html"&gt;Galatians 5:19-21&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Colossians/3/Colossians-3-5.html"&gt;Colossians 3:5-10&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-Corinthians/6/1-Corinthians-6-12.html"&gt;1 Corinthians 6:12-17&lt;/a&gt;). It is in our best interest to avoid pursuing these worldly pleasures, as they are not conducive to long-term joy and often leave us empty. Rather than being a killjoy, God is actually protecting us and providing what is truly best for us. This can be compared to an earthly parent who sets boundaries for their children's well-being. Though the children may see the parent as a killjoy for limiting their candy consumption, the boundaries ultimately benefit them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bbd-hRlCux8" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Focusing on the Giver, Not Just the Gift&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it is important to appreciate and enjoy the good things that God provides, we must remember that the purpose of our lives is not solely to seek pleasure. Our lives have deep meaning, and we were created to delight in God Himself (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/37/Psalm-37-4.html"&gt;Psalm 37:4&lt;/a&gt;). The focus should be on the Giver, not just the gifts. God is not a killjoy; in fact, He is the source of true joy. His Spirit produces joy in our lives (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Galatians/5/Galatians-5-22.html"&gt;Galatians 5:22&lt;/a&gt;). Any pursuit of pleasure apart from God can lead to idolatry. God opposes our pursuit of worldly and temporary joy because He knows it is not ultimately beneficial for us. Sometimes, we need to put aside instant gratification in order to invest in the greater joy found in God's kingdom. As &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/16/Psalm-16-11.html"&gt;Psalm 16:11&lt;/a&gt; reminds us, "You will fill me with joy in your presence, with eternal pleasures at your right hand."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding God's character as one who desires our joy and fullness of life is crucial for our relationship with Him. It helps us realize that He is not a killjoy but rather a loving Father who wants what is best for His children. By embracing this truth, we can experience true joy and find contentment in living according to His design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does the idea of God as a cosmic killjoy affect your perception of Him?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In what ways can you seek joy and find pleasure in activities that align with God's will?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reflect on moments when you have experienced true joy in your relationship with God or in living according to His principles. How did these experiences differ from temporary pleasures?&lt;/li&gt;

Contrary to this misconception, the Bible paints a different picture of Godâ€”a God who created us with the â€¦&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;God's Pleasure: Finding Joy in the Creator's Design&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our understanding of God, it is important to recognize that He is not a stern taskmaster opposed to all fun or pleasure. Contrary to this misconception, the Bible paints a different picture of Godâ€”a God who created us with the ability to experience delight and pleasure. Scripture speaks of our enjoyment and pleasure in various contexts, such as Psalm 16, &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Proverbs/17/Proverbs-17-22.html"&gt;Proverbs 17:22&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Proverbs/15/Proverbs-15-13.html"&gt;Proverbs 15:13&lt;/a&gt;. These verses reveal that God desires His creation to be enjoyed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God Himself takes pleasure in things, as seen in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Zephaniah/3/Zephaniah-3-17.html"&gt;Zephaniah 3:17&lt;/a&gt; where it states that He delights in us and sings over us. Additionally, God instituted celebrations and festivals in the Old Testament which were not only didactic but also intended for joyous celebration. Joy is a recurring theme in Scripture, evident in books like Philippians and Psalms. Jesus Himself declared that He came so that we may have life to the full (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/10/John-10-10.html"&gt;John 10:10&lt;/a&gt;). This abundant life implies a pleasurable experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, when we consider the design of the human body, we can see that pleasure is part of God's plan. Our taste buds and sensory organs testify to the fact that God is not opposed to pleasure. The enjoyment we derive from food, the pleasant scent of roses, or the satisfaction of a massage is evidence of God's intention for pleasure. He designed these experiences to bring delight into our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to distinguish between different types of pleasures in this world. We live in a fallen world where what society deems pleasurable does not always align with what is pleasing to God. &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Galatians/5/Galatians-5-19.html"&gt;Galatians 5:19-21&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Colossians/3/Colossians-3-5.html"&gt;Colossians 3:5-10&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-Corinthians/6/1-Corinthians-6-12.html"&gt;1 Corinthians 6:12-17&lt;/a&gt; caution against indulging in worldly pleasures that are ultimately destructive. The story of the prodigal son in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/15/Luke-15-11.html"&gt;Luke 15:11-17&lt;/a&gt; exemplifies how fleeting and empty worldly pleasures can be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, it is crucial to note that the purpose of our lives is not solely focused on pleasure. Hedonism, the pursuit of pleasure as the ultimate goal, is a false philosophy. Instead, we were created to find delight in God (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/37/Psalm-37-4.html"&gt;Psalm 37:4&lt;/a&gt;) and to gratefully accept the good things He provides. Above all, our primary purpose is to have a relationship with God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary, God is not opposed to pleasure per se. He is opposed to pleasure taking His place in our lives. Sometimes, we are called to forgo momentary pleasures in order to invest in the greater joy of God's kingdom. By seeking Him and His righteousness, we can experience the eternal pleasures that He has in store for us (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/16/Psalm-16-11.html"&gt;Psalm 16:11&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QPywCD-TSd0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding God's perspective on pleasure helps us navigate the complexities of life. It enables us to discern between healthy and unhealthy pleasures, guiding us towards choices that align with God's will. Recognizing that God delights in us and desires our enjoyment helps counter the misconception that Christianity is solely about following rules or denying ourselves joy. Embracing the biblical concept of pleasure brings a sense of freedom and fulfillment as we engage with the world around us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does your understanding of God's view on pleasure affect your own pursuit of joy?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are there any pleasures in your life that you feel might be taking precedence over your relationship with God?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In what ways can you actively seek and cultivate the eternal pleasures that God has in store for you?&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Bible describes God as a God of miracles, who performs extraordinary acts that display His power and inspire wonder in humans. A miracle is an act of God beyond human understanding that reveals His power, acts as a sign of His work in the world, and inspires awe and wonder. The Greek word for miracle, "dunamis," means power, emphasizing that miracles are a display of God's supernatural power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Miracles as Signs, Wonders, and Power&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bible uses three main words to describe miracles: signs, wonders, and power. These words help us understand what it means for God to be the God of miracles. A miracle is an extraordinary or unnatural event that reveals or confirms a specific message through a mighty work of God. It is not merely a means of authenticating Himself to people but rather a way for God to reveal Himself to those who have eyes of faith to see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;God's Supernatural Power&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God uses supernatural power to perform miracles and reveal Himself to people on Earth. His miracles often defy or overpower the laws of nature, but He can also work within nature to perform miracles. For example, when God parted the Red Sea, He used a powerful wind. Miracles capture people's attention by their unusual and unnatural nature, inspiring them to seek God and His message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Miracles as Signs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Miracles serve as signs that convey a message or reveal truth. They are not meant to amuse or entertain but rather to glorify God. For example, when Jesus raised Lazarus from the dead, He did so to confirm that He was sent by God and had power over death. Through this miracle, many people put their faith in Christ and believed in Him as the Son of God. Miracles have a purpose beyond the immediate event; they convey a truth or confirm a message from God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Nature and Purpose of Miracles&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The power behind miracles reveals their source: God. The wonder of miracles showcases their awe-inspiring nature and captures our attention. The sign of miracles conveys a specific message or truth. Miracles demonstrate God's absolute control over nature, events, people, and powers. They reveal who God is and awaken humans to His presence and the presence of His Kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The Greatest Miracle: Salvation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God's greatest miracle is the salvation He offers through His Son, Jesus Christ. Jesus, as both fully God and fully man, paid the ultimate price for our sins through His sacrificial death on the cross. By overcoming the power of death through His resurrection, Jesus accomplished the miracle of salvation. This miracle demonstrates God's love for humanity and provides a way for us to be reconciled with Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding God as the God of miracles is essential for deepening our faith and relationship with Him. Recognizing that God has the power to perform miracles helps us trust in His providence and sovereignty over all things. Miracles remind us that God is actively at work in the world, revealing Himself to those who have eyes to see. They also affirm the truth of God's Word and confirm His message. Ultimately, recognizing God as the God of miracles strengthens our faith and encourages us to seek a deeper understanding of His character and purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Think About It&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reflect on a time when you witnessed or experienced a miracle in your life or someone else's life. How did it impact your faith?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consider how miracles can serve as signs that convey a specific message or truth from God. How can we discern the message behind a miracle?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Explore examples of miracles in the Bible and reflect on their purpose and significance. How do these miracles shape your understanding of God's power and character?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consider the miracle of salvation through Jesus Christ. How does this miracle impact your relationship with God and your understanding of His love for humanity?&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In various places throughout the Bible, we come across the phrase "God remembered." It is used to describe significant moments when God acted on behalf of His people. However, this phrase can be confusing if we interpret it as implying forgetfulness on God's part. We need to understand that God's nature is infinite, all-knowing, and perfect. He is not subject to human limitations such as forgetfulness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, when the Bible says that "God remembered," it is emphasizing His faithfulness and everlasting care for His creation. It signifies that God is about to take action or fulfill a promise. This phrase is often followed by some form of intervention or work on behalf of God's people. Let's explore several key instances where "God remembered" is mentioned in the Bible and understand their significance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Great Flood&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the rains of the great flood had ceased, we read in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/8/Genesis-8-1.html"&gt;Genesis 8:1&lt;/a&gt;, "But God remembered Noah and all the wild animals and livestock with him in the ark." This passage does not imply that God forgot about Noah and the animals during the flood; rather, it emphasizes God's faithfulness to His covenant with Noah. After this remembrance, God caused the wind to blow, which began to dry up the water that covered the earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; The phrase "God remembered" in the context of the great flood shows us that even in times of great trial and devastation, God remains true to His promises. It reminds us of His faithfulness and love for His creation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; Just as God remembered Noah during the flood, He also remembers us in our own trials and challenges. How does knowing that God is faithful and caring impact your perspective during difficult times?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Hebrew Slaves in Egypt&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Exodus/2/Exodus-2-24.html"&gt;Exodus 2:24&lt;/a&gt;, we read, "God heard their groaning, and he remembered his covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob." The Israelites were oppressed and enslaved in Egypt, crying out to God for deliverance. When it says that "God remembered," it signifies that God was about to act on behalf of His people. In the following chapters, we see how God sets in motion His plan to free the Israelites from their bondage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; The phrase "God remembered" in the context of the Hebrew slaves in Egypt shows us that God hears the cries of His people and is moved to action. It reminds us that God is attentive to our pleas for deliverance and salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; Are there areas in your life where you feel oppressed or in bondage? How does knowing that God remembers His people give you hope for deliverance and freedom?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;God's Love and Faithfulness&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/98/Psalm-98-3.html"&gt;Psalm 98:3&lt;/a&gt; says, "He has remembered his love and his faithfulness to Israel." This verse highlights the enduring nature of God's love and faithfulness towards His chosen people. It assures us that God never forgets His promises and continues to act on behalf of those He loves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6CzaLOydr8U" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; The verse reminds us that God's love and faithfulness are unwavering. In times when we may feel forgotten or abandoned, we can take comfort in the fact that God's love for us endures forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; Reflect on moments when you have experienced God's love and faithfulness in your own life. How does remembering these instances strengthen your trust in Him?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Anthropomorphism and Figurative Language&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Expressions such as "God remembered" are examples of anthropomorphism. Anthropomorphism is a figure of speech where certain traits of finite humanity are ascribed to the infinite God. Throughout the Bible, we find various figures of speech that help us understand God's work from a human perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we encounter phrases like "God remembered," it is not suggesting that God forgets things. God's knowledge is perfect, and He sees and knows all things. These expressions are used to convey God's faithfulness, love, and action on behalf of His people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Understanding anthropomorphism helps us interpret biblical language correctly and deepens our understanding of God's character and actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; How does recognizing the use of figurative language in the Bible help you gain a clearer understanding of God's nature and His relationship with humanity?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, when we encounter the phrase "God remembered" in the Bible, it does not imply forgetfulness on God's part. It emphasizes His faithfulness, love, and action on behalf of His people. God's nature is infinite and all-knowing, and He never forgets. The phrase "God remembered" reminds us of His unwavering love, enduring faithfulness, and His constant work in our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we reflect on these instances where "God remembered," let us find comfort in knowing that God always remembers us, hears our cries, and acts on our behalf. May we trust in His faithfulness and seek to deepen our relationship with Him, knowing that He is always present and actively involved in our lives.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/The Character of God/How God Works"></category><category term="null"></category></entry><entry><title>Discovering God's Unique and Transformative Differences</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/god-different/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-05-29T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-05-29T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-05-29:/god-different/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;God in the Old and New Testaments&lt;/h2&gt;

However, upon â€¦&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;God in the Old and New Testaments&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When discussing the nature of God, some may suggest that the God of the Old Testament is different from the God of the New Testament. This misconception often stems from a misunderstanding of how God's character is revealed throughout both testaments. However, upon closer examination of the Bible, it becomes evident that God's attributes, including His love and wrath, are consistently portrayed in both the Old and New Testaments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;God's Love and Wrath Revealed&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout the Old Testament, God is repeatedly described as compassionate, gracious, and abounding in love and faithfulness (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Exodus/34/Exodus-34-6.html"&gt;Exodus 34:6&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Numbers/14/Numbers-14-18.html"&gt;Numbers 14:18&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Deuteronomy/4/Deuteronomy-4-31.html"&gt;Deuteronomy 4:31&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Nehemiah/9/Nehemiah-9-17.html"&gt;Nehemiah 9:17&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/86/Psalm-86-5.html"&gt;Psalm 86:5&lt;/a&gt;, 15; 108:4; 145:8; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Joel/2/Joel-2-13.html"&gt;Joel 2:13&lt;/a&gt;). This loving-kindness and mercy are further exemplified in the New Testament through the ultimate expression of God's loveâ€”sending His Son Jesus Christ as an atoning sacrifice for our sins (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/3/John-3-16.html"&gt;John 3:16&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-John/4/1-John-4-10.html"&gt;1 John 4:10&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In both testaments, we also witness God's response to rebellion and sin. In the Old Testament, when the Israelites turned away from Him to worship idols, God would discipline them. However, He would always deliver them after they repented (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/12/Hebrews-12-6.html"&gt;Hebrews 12:6&lt;/a&gt;). Similarly, in the New Testament, we see that God's wrath is still being revealed against godlessness and wickedness (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/1/Romans-1-18.html"&gt;Romans 1:18&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;God's Unchanging Nature&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to understand that while certain aspects of God's nature may be emphasized in specific passages, God Himself does not change. The Bible consistently portrays God as immutable or unchanging (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/James/1/James-1-17.html"&gt;James 1:17&lt;/a&gt;). Despite being written by multiple authors over a span of approximately 1500 years, in different languages and on different continents, the Bible remains one unified book without contradictions. God's love for His creation, especially mankind, is evident throughout Scripture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gaS59ddVkao" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The Sacrificial System and Jesus Christ&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Old Testament, God established a sacrificial system as a temporary means of atonement for sin. However, this system merely foreshadowed the ultimate expression of God's loveâ€”the coming of Jesus Christ. In the New Testament, we witness the fulfillment of these promises, as Jesus dies on the cross to make a complete substitutionary atonement for sin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the consistency of God's character throughout the Old and New Testaments is crucial for our faith. It reassures us that God's love, mercy, and justice remain unchanged. Recognizing this continuity strengthens our trust in His promises and His plan for salvation through Jesus Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider how your understanding of God's nature in both the Old and New Testaments impacts your relationship with Him. Reflect on the unchanging love and justice He displays and how that influences your faith journey.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/The Character of God/How God Works"></category><category term="null"></category></entry><entry><title>'Unveiling God''s Mysterious Ways: A Christian''s Guide to Divine Providence'</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/god-works-in-mysterious-ways/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-05-29T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-05-29T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-05-29:/god-works-in-mysterious-ways/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;God's Mysterious Ways&lt;/h2&gt;

While the interplay â€¦&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;God's Mysterious Ways&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God's ways are often described as mysterious, leaving people bewildered and questioning why certain events unfold as they do. Throughout the Bible and the testimonies of Christians throughout history, we find stories of how God turns situations upside down in unexpected and inexplicable ways. While the interplay between human freedom and God's sovereignty may be beyond our understanding, we can still explore some key examples that demonstrate God's mysterious workings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Example of Joseph&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The life of Joseph serves as a powerful example of God's mysterious ways. Joseph's story can be found in the book of Genesis (Chapters 37-50), and it highlights how God used a series of events, including Joseph being sold into slavery by his own brothers, to ultimately bring about His plan to save His covenant people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joseph's brothers' evil intentions led to him being sold into slavery, but through a series of remarkable events, Joseph became the governor of Egypt and was able to provide food for his family during a famine in their homeland. This seemingly cruel twist of fate allowed Joseph to rescue his family and eventually paved the way for the exodus from Egypt led by Moses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Joseph had been given the choice, he likely would not have willingly endured the suffering he experienced. But from God's perspective, every event in Joseph's life served His ultimate plan. God saw beyond the immediate hardships and knew that these circumstances would lead to the salvation of His people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt;
Understanding God's mysterious ways helps us trust in His sovereignty even when circumstances seem confusing or painful. It reminds us that God is always working behind the scenes, orchestrating events for our ultimate good and His greater purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt;
Consider a time in your life when things seemed confusing or difficult. Reflect on how that situation may have ultimately brought about something positive or allowed you to grow spiritually. How does this experience shape your understanding of God's mysterious ways?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Paradox of God's Movement&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Csae7vjbmkA" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;God's mysterious ways often involve paradoxes, where seemingly contradictory elements coexist. These paradoxes can be seen throughout Joseph's story and many other instances in the Bible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, Joseph's rise to power in Egypt seemed to contradict the initial evil intentions of his brothers. While they meant harm, God used their actions for good (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/50/Genesis-50-20.html"&gt;Genesis 50:20&lt;/a&gt;). Similarly, Joseph's time in prison opened the door to his position in the palace, ultimately leading to the salvation of his family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These paradoxes can be difficult for our finite minds to comprehend. We often crave logical explanations and clear cause-and-effect relationships, but God's ways transcend our understanding. &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/55/Isaiah-55-8.html"&gt;Isaiah 55:8-9&lt;/a&gt; tells us that God's thoughts are higher than ours, just as the heavens are higher than the earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt;
Embracing the paradoxes of God's movement helps us let go of our need for complete understanding and trust in His sovereignty. It reminds us that God's ways are not limited by human logic and that He can bring about good even in the midst of what may seem like impossible situations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt;
Consider a situation in your life where you struggled to understand why things happened the way they did. How does embracing the paradoxes of God's movement change your perspective on that situation? How does it impact your trust in God?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Faith and Trusting in God's Plan&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Christians, we are called to walk by faith and not by sight (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/2-Corinthians/5/2-Corinthians-5-7.html"&gt;2 Corinthians 5:7&lt;/a&gt;). This means trusting in God's plan even when we can't see how everything will work out. It means acknowledging our limited understanding and relying on God's wisdom and guidance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joseph's story teaches us the importance of faith and trust. Despite the hardships he faced, Joseph remained faithful to God and trusted in His plan. He recognized that even though he couldn't understand all the details at the time, God was working behind the scenes for a greater purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt;
Embracing faith and trusting in God's plan allows us to find peace and assurance in the midst of uncertainty. It frees us from the need to have all the answers and enables us to surrender control to God, knowing that He is always working for our ultimate good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt;
Reflect on a situation in your life where you struggled to have faith and trust in God's plan. How did this impact your peace of mind and overall well-being? What steps can you take to cultivate a deeper sense of trust in God's mysterious ways?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God's mysterious ways may leave us bewildered, but they also invite us into a deeper relationship with Him. As we ponder the examples of Joseph and other biblical figures, we are reminded that God's methods are beyond our understanding. His ways often involve paradoxes, seemingly contradictory elements that ultimately reveal His wisdom and goodness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trusting in God's plan and walking by faith allows us to navigate life's uncertainties with peace and assurance. It helps us embrace the mystery of God's workings, knowing that He is always at work behind the scenes, orchestrating events for our ultimate good and His greater purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we continue on our faith journey, let us remember that while we may not always understand God's mysterious ways, we can find comfort in knowing that His thoughts are higher than ours. So let us trust in Him, surrendering our need for complete understanding and embracing the beauty of His mysterious ways.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/The Character of God/How God Works"></category><category term="null"></category></entry><entry><title>'Experience the Miracles of the God of Wonders: A Christian''s Guide'</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/god-of-wonders/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-05-02T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-05-02T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-05-02:/god-of-wonders/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;God of Wonders&lt;/h2&gt;

These acts are often referred to as miracles or wonders. When we say that God is a God of wonders â€¦&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;God of Wonders&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The one true God is a God of wonders. Throughout the Bible, we find numerous accounts of the great acts that God has performed for His people. These acts are often referred to as miracles or wonders. When we say that God is a God of wonders, we mean that He is a God who carries out miraculous works. These wonders declare His absolute control over events, people, and powers, and reveal His presence among His people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Wonders of the Old Testament&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Old Testament, we find two Hebrew words that are translated as "wonder" in English: mopheth and pala. Mopheth means "a splendid or remarkable work" or "miracle." This word is often associated with the "signs and wonders" that God performed through Moses during the exodus from Egypt. These miracles displayed God's power and authority over Pharaoh and the false gods of Egypt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pala means "wondrous works" or "marvelous deeds" and frequently appears in the psalms. The psalmists recount these marvelous works to give thanks to God and to declare His greatness. These wondrous deeds by the God of wonders are unique displays of divine power that go far beyond human ability and power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Wonders of the New Testament&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New Testament also showcases the wonders of God. In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/21/Matthew-21-15.html"&gt;Matthew 21:15&lt;/a&gt;, the miracles of Jesus are referred to as "wonderful things." The Greek word used here is "thaumasios," which conveys the sense of something that causes astonishment or wonder. In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Acts/5/Acts-5-12.html"&gt;Acts 5:12&lt;/a&gt;, Luke speaks of many "signs and wonders" performed by the apostles. And in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/2-Corinthians/12/2-Corinthians-12-12.html"&gt;2 Corinthians 12:12&lt;/a&gt;, the signs of a true apostle include "signs, wonders, and miracles."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These wonders in the New Testament demonstrate that Jesus is the Son of God, sent to bring about redemption and salvation. Through His ministry, Jesus performed miraculous acts that revealed His divine power and authority. These wonders authenticated His presence and the nearness of God's kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Purpose of God's Wonders&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God's wonders reveal His omnipotence and His love for His people. In the Old Testament, the plagues that God brought upon Egypt demonstrated His absolute power over all other gods. These wonders not only delivered the Israelites from slavery but also served as a powerful witness to the Egyptians of Yahweh's supremacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GpwM3atIDJ8" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through His wondrous acts, the God of wonders also reveals His character, His purposes, and His power on earth. People who witness these miracles are filled with awe and wonder. The wonders of God are designed to draw people to Himself and to show them His love, protection, and provision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Reflecting on God's Wonders&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we reflect on the wonders of God, we are reminded of His limitless power and His inescapable presence. We are encouraged to trust in Him and to seek His guidance and provision in our lives. The wonders of God also remind us of the importance of recognizing and acknowledging His sovereignty over all things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Understanding that God is a God of wonders helps us develop a deeper appreciation for His power and authority. It strengthens our faith and trust in Him, knowing that He is capable of delivering us from any situation. Recognizing God's wonders also reminds us of the importance of giving thanks to Him for His marvelous deeds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; Take a moment to reflect on some of the wonders that God has performed in your own life or in the lives of those around you. How have these acts of God demonstrated His love, protection, or provision? How can you respond with gratitude and awe when you witness the wonders of God in your life? Consider sharing your experiences with others to encourage their faith and trust in the God of wonders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, the God of wonders reveals His power, love, and purposes through the miraculous acts He performs. These wonders are unique displays of divine power that go beyond human understanding. They authenticate His presence and declare His sovereignty over all things. As we reflect on these wonders, we are reminded of God's limitless power and are called to respond with awe, trust, and gratitude.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/The Character of God/How God Works"></category><category term="null"></category></entry><entry><title>7 Miracles in the Bible That Will Deepen Your Faith</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/miracles-bible/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-04-21T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-04-21T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-04-21:/miracles-bible/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Miracles in the Bible&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Miracles in the Bible have always captivated the hearts and minds of believers. Many individuals long for God to perform miracles as a means of proving His existence and power. However, it is important to understand that this desire for miracles has its limitations and is not necessarily aligned with the teachings of Scripture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Role of Miracles&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we examine the role of miracles in the Bible, we see that they were not always effective in producing lasting faith and obedience. Despite witnessing incredible miracles, such as the parting of the Red Sea, the Israelites frequently rebelled against God. Even after experiencing these miraculous events, they doubted God's ability to conquer the Promised Land. This pattern is highlighted in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/16/Luke-16-19.html"&gt;Luke 16:19-31&lt;/a&gt;, where a man in hell asks Abraham to send Lazarus back from the dead to warn his brothers. Abraham responds by saying, "If they do not listen to Moses and the Prophets, they will not be convinced even if someone rises from the dead" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/16/Luke-16-31.html"&gt;Luke 16:31&lt;/a&gt;). This passage reminds us that even witnessing miracles does not guarantee true faith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, during His earthly ministry, Jesus performed countless miracles, yet many people did not believe in Him. If God were to perform miracles today as He did in the past, the outcome would likely be similar. People might initially be amazed and believe, but their faith would likely be shallow and easily shaken when faced with unexpected or challenging circumstances. A faith solely based on miracles is not a mature faith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Greatest Miracle&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/v2hASVsHG04" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ultimate miracle that God performed was sending His Son, Jesus Christ, to earth. Jesus came as a man and willingly died on the cross for our sins (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/5/Romans-5-8.html"&gt;Romans 5:8&lt;/a&gt;). This sacrificial act allows us to be saved through faith in Him (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/3/John-3-16.html"&gt;John 3:16&lt;/a&gt;). The miracle of salvation through Jesus Christ is what truly matters in our relationship with God. While God still performs miracles today, many of these miracles go unnoticed or are denied. However, what we truly need is to believe in the miracle of salvation through faith in Jesus Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Purpose of Miracles&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Miracles served a specific purpose in the Bible â€” to authenticate the performer of the miracles. &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Acts/2/Acts-2-22.html"&gt;Acts 2:22&lt;/a&gt; states, "Men of Israel, listen to this: Jesus of Nazareth was a man accredited by God to you by miracles, wonders and signs, which God did among you through him, as you yourselves know." The apostles were also marked by signs, wonders, and miracles (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/2-Corinthians/12/2-Corinthians-12-12.html"&gt;2 Corinthians 12:12&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, it is important to note that we now have the truth of Jesus recorded in Scripture. The teachings of Jesus and the writings of the apostles are the foundation of our faith (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Ephesians/2/Ephesians-2-20.html"&gt;Ephesians 2:20&lt;/a&gt;). Miracles are no longer necessary in the same way they were during biblical times because the message of Jesus and His apostles has been accurately recorded in the Scriptures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Need for Faith&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Faith plays a central role in our relationship with God. &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/11/Hebrews-11-1.html"&gt;Hebrews 11:1&lt;/a&gt; defines faith as "the assurance of things hoped for, the conviction of things not seen." While miracles may initially bolster someone's faith, true faith goes beyond relying solely on miraculous signs and wonders. Our faith should be grounded in a deep trust and belief in God's character and promises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the role of miracles and their limitations is crucial for our spiritual growth. It helps us avoid placing an undue emphasis on seeking after signs and wonders as a means to validate our faith. Instead, we can focus on cultivating a deeper relationship with God based on His Word and His character.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How has your view of miracles influenced your perception of God's presence and power?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What steps can you take to deepen your faith and develop a more mature understanding of God's character?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can you rely more on the truth of Scripture rather than seeking after miracles as a sign of God's presence?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, miracles in the Bible served a purpose in authenticating the messengers and pointing to God's power. However, they do not guarantee lasting faith or obedience. The ultimate miracle is the sacrificial death and resurrection of Jesus Christ, which offers salvation to all who believe. While God still performs miracles today, our focus should be on developing a deep faith grounded in His Word and character rather than solely seeking after signs and wonders.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/The Character of God/How God Works"></category><category term="null"></category></entry><entry><title>'Revealing God''s Presence: An In-Depth Exploration for Christian Believers'</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/god-reveal-himself/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-04-16T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-04-16T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-04-16:/god-reveal-himself/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;God Reveals Himself&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bible tells us that God reveals Himself to humans in four primary ways. Let's explore each of these ways in more detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1. Creation: Nature as a Revelation of God&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Bible tells us that God reveals Himself to humans in four primary ways. Let's explore each of these ways in more detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1. Creation: Nature as a Revelation of God&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One way that God reveals Himself to us is through His creation. When we look at the world around usâ€”the heavens, the earth, and all that is in itâ€”we can see the beauty and complexity of God's handiwork. As &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/19/Psalm-19-1.html"&gt;Psalm 19:1-4&lt;/a&gt; says, "The heavens proclaim the glory of God. The skies display his craftsmanship. Day after day they continue to speak; night after night they make him known." Through everything God has made, we can catch a glimpse of His invisible qualitiesâ€”His eternal power and divine nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nature serves as a testimony to the existence and character of God. Just as an artist's masterpiece reflects their skill and creativity, creation points to the existence of a powerful and intelligent Creator. The intricate design of living organisms, the vastness of the cosmos, and the delicate balance of ecosystems all reveal the wisdom and intentionality of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding that nature reveals God's existence can deepen our awe and appreciation for the natural world. It reminds us that there is more to life than what meets the eye and encourages us to seek a deeper relationship with our Creator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Think About It&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take a moment to reflect on the beauty and complexity of nature around you. Consider how it points to the existence and character of God. How does this revelation shape your understanding of the world?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2. Conscience: The Inner Voice&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another way that God reveals Himself to humans is through our conscience. Scripture tells us that even those who do not have knowledge of God's written law still show an awareness of His moral standards. &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/2/Romans-2-14.html"&gt;Romans 2:14-15&lt;/a&gt; says, "Even Gentiles, who do not have Godâ€™s written law, show that they know his law when they instinctively obey it, even without having heard it. They demonstrate that Godâ€™s law is written in their hearts, for their own conscience and thoughts either accuse them or tell them they are doing right."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God has placed a sense of right and wrong within each human heart. This internal moral compass bears witness to His existence and reveals His standards of righteousness. Our conscience can convict us when we go against what we know to be right and guide us towards actions that align with God's principles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding that our conscience reflects God's moral law helps us recognize the universal nature of ethical standards. It reminds us that we are not left to navigate life's complexities on our own but have an inner guide that reflects God's wisdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Think About It&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reflect on a time when your conscience led you to make a decision guided by what you believed to be right. How does this experience testify to the existence and influence of God in your life?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;3. Jesus Christ: The Ultimate Revelation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most significant revelation of God to humanity is found in the person of Jesus Christ. Jesus is described as the "visible image of the invisible God" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Colossians/1/Colossians-1-15.html"&gt;Colossians 1:15&lt;/a&gt;) and the one who has revealed God to us (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/1/John-1-18.html"&gt;John 1:18&lt;/a&gt;). In Jesus, we see the fullness of God's character, love, and grace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through His life, teachings, miracles, death, and resurrection, Jesus demonstrated God's power and revealed His plan for salvation. He showed us what it means to live a life pleasing to God and offered Himself as a sacrifice for our sins. As &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/14/John-14-9.html"&gt;John 14:9&lt;/a&gt; says, "Anyone who has seen me has seen the Father!"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus' ministry on earth was marked by compassion, forgiveness, and selflessness. He taught us about the kingdom of heaven, performed miracles to heal the sick and raise the dead, and ultimately laid down His life to reconcile humanity with God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Hjqlx8GGZG0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recognizing Jesus as the ultimate revelation of God compels us to respond to His message and invitation. It challenges us to consider our own beliefs and relationship with Him, knowing that Jesus' life and teachings are central to understanding God's plan for salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Think About It&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider the impact Jesus' life and teachings have had on your understanding of God. How does His example inspire you to live a life that reflects the character of God?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;4. The Word of God: Scripture as Revelation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bible is another crucial way through which God reveals Himself to humanity. It is His written Word, inspired by the Holy Spirit, and serves as a reliable source of knowledge about who God is and how He interacts with His creation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scripture contains a collection of writings spanning different genres, including history, poetry, prophecy, letters, and more. It presents us with eyewitness accounts of God's work throughout history and provides insight into His character, purposes, and promises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus Himself affirmed the authority and importance of Scripture. He said, "You study the Scriptures diligently because you think that in them you have eternal life. These are the very Scriptures that testify about me" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/5/John-5-39.html"&gt;John 5:39&lt;/a&gt;). The Bible is not just a book of moral teachings or historical records; it is a revelation of God Himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recognizing the Bible as God's revelation helps us understand that it is more than just a collection of ancient texts. It invites us into an ongoing conversation with our Creator and guides us in living a life that honors Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Think About It&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider how your understanding of God has been shaped through reading and studying the Bible. How has Scripture helped you grow in your relationship with Him?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God reveals Himself to humanity in various waysâ€”through His creation, our conscience, Jesus Christ, and the Bible. These avenues of revelation provide us with glimpses of His character, power, and love. By recognizing and embracing these revelations, we can deepen our relationship with God and live in alignment with His will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding that God reveals Himself through nature encourages us to appreciate the world around us and recognize its divine origin. Recognizing the voice of our conscience as God's moral law guides us in making decisions that honor Him. Embracing Jesus Christ as the ultimate revelation challenges us to follow His example and accept His offer of salvation. Finally, studying and engaging with the Word of God enables us to grow in our understanding of who He is and how He desires us to live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we seek to know God more fully through these revelations, may we continually strive to align our lives with His purposes and experience the joy of a deep, personal relationship with our Creator.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/The Character of God/How God Works"></category><category term="null"></category></entry><entry><title>'Discover the Role of the Right Hand of God in Christian Faith: A Divine Perspective'</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/right-hand-god/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-03-31T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-03-31T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-03-31:/right-hand-god/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Right Hand of God&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The term "right hand of God" is mentioned several times in the Bible, and it holds significant meaning in the Christian faith. It can refer to several things, including direction, righteousness, honor, and authority. In the Bible, when blessings were divided or appointments were made, the right hand or right side was given priority. For example, Jacob divided his blessings among Joseph's sons before he died, placing his right hand on the younger son Ephraim's head and his left hand on Manasseh's head (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/48/Genesis-48-13.html"&gt;Genesis 48:13-14&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to denoting precedence, placing someone on the right hand was a way of giving them equal honor and recognizing their authority. The Apostle Paul writes about Jesus Christ being seated at the right hand of God in Ephesians, emphasizing His surpassing greatness and authority over all principalities and powers (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Ephesians/1/Ephesians-1-19.html"&gt;Ephesians 1:19-21&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The phrase "God's right hand" in prophecy refers to the Messiah, who is given power and authority to subdue His enemies (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/110/Psalm-110-1.html"&gt;Psalm 110:1&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/118/Psalm-118-16.html"&gt;Psalm 118:16&lt;/a&gt;). Jesus references this verse in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/22/Matthew-22-44.html"&gt;Matthew 22:44&lt;/a&gt;, affirming Himself as the Son of David and the Messiah who sits at God's right hand. This position signifies His exalted status and authority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/heFh5aQjwtI" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus being seated at the right hand of God was a sign to His disciples that He had ascended into heaven. In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/16/John-16-7.html"&gt;John 16:7-15&lt;/a&gt;, Jesus tells His disciples that He must go away but will send the Holy Spirit. The coming of the Holy Spirit on the day of Pentecost confirmed that Jesus was indeed in heaven, seated at the right hand of God. The Apostle Paul further affirms this in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/8/Romans-8-34.html"&gt;Romans 8:34&lt;/a&gt;, stating that Christ intercedes for us at God's right hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary, "God's right hand" symbolizes the Messiah, Jesus Christ, who holds equal position, honor, power, and authority with God. His seating at God's right hand signifies the completion of His work of redemption. When the fullness of the Gentiles is brought in and all prophecy is fulfilled, Christ's enemies will be made His footstool (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/11/Romans-11-25.html"&gt;Romans 11:25&lt;/a&gt;). It is a powerful reminder of the exalted status and authority of Jesus Christ in the divine plan of salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the significance of "God's right hand" helps us grasp the central role of Jesus Christ in Christianity. It highlights His authority over all things and His intercession on our behalf. Recognizing that Jesus is seated at God's right hand gives us assurance that He is actively involved in our lives and is working for our good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reflect on the authority and power of Jesus Christ as depicted by Him being seated at God's right hand. How does this impact your understanding of His role in your life?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider the significance of Jesus' work being completed and His enemies being made His footstool. How does this give you hope and assurance for the future?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In what ways can you rely on Jesus' intercession at God's right hand in your own prayers and spiritual journey?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

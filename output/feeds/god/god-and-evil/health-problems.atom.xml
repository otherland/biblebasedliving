&lt;p&gt;When we experience sickness or suffering, it can be challenging to understand why God allows it. However, as Christians, we believe that God's ways are higher than our ways (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/55/Isaiah-55-9.html"&gt;Isaiah 55:9&lt;/a&gt;) and that He can bring about good from any situation (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/8/Romans-8-28.html"&gt;Romans 8:28 …&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;God's Purpose in Allowing Sickness&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we experience sickness or suffering, it can be challenging to understand why God allows it. However, as Christians, we believe that God's ways are higher than our ways (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/55/Isaiah-55-9.html"&gt;Isaiah 55:9&lt;/a&gt;) and that He can bring about good from any situation (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/8/Romans-8-28.html"&gt;Romans 8:28&lt;/a&gt;). While sickness is not always directly from God, He sometimes allows or even causes it to accomplish His sovereign purposes. It is important to remember that even in times of sickness, God is still in control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Sickness in a Fallen World&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a world tainted by sin, sickness, disease, and death will always be present. As fallen beings with physical bodies prone to disease and illness, we are susceptible to sickness as a result of the natural course of things in this world. Some sickness may also be the result of a demonic attack, as described in the Bible (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/17/Matthew-17-14.html"&gt;Matthew 17:14-18&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/13/Luke-13-10.html"&gt;Luke 13:10-16&lt;/a&gt;). Even in these instances, God remains in control and can still use sickness according to His perfect will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Sickness as Discipline and Spiritual Growth&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/12/Hebrews-12-5.html"&gt;Hebrews 12:5-11&lt;/a&gt; describes how God disciplines us to produce a harvest of righteousness. While sickness is not directly addressed in this passage, it teaches us that discipline can be a means through which God works for our spiritual growth. It may be difficult for us to comprehend why God would use sickness in this manner, but as believers in His sovereignty, we understand that suffering is something He allows and/or causes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The psalmist in Psalm 119 provides us with an example of looking at suffering from God's perspective. As the psalmist reflects on his own afflictions, he acknowledges that it was good for him to be afflicted so that he might learn God's decrees and obey His Word. The psalmist recognizes that it was through his suffering that God's faithfulness was revealed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;God's Sovereignty in Sickness&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding and accepting God's sovereignty in sickness can be a challenging concept. While we may not fully grasp why God allows sickness, we can trust that He is working all things for our ultimate good and His glory. Even the ultimate suffering—death—can be seen as an act of God's goodness, as it grants believers eternal life in heaven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Ministering to Those Suffering&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MGMRuIVGSNc" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When people are suffering, it is important for us as Christians to minister to them, care for them, pray for them, and offer comfort. In the midst of suffering, it may not always be appropriate to emphasize the idea that God will bring good out of the suffering. While this truth is valid, those who are suffering need our love and encouragement more than theological reminders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding why God allows sickness is crucial in our walk of faith. It helps us navigate the challenges and uncertainties that come with illness and suffering. Recognizing that sickness can serve a purpose in God's greater plan can bring comfort and hope during difficult times. It also reminds us of our need to trust in God's sovereignty and lean on Him for strength and guidance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Think About It&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does knowing that sickness is a result of living in a fallen world affect your perspective on illness?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reflect on a time when you or someone you know experienced sickness or suffering. In what ways did it lead to spiritual growth or draw you closer to God?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can you minister to those who are suffering without overwhelming them with theological explanations?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;</content><category term="God/God and Evil/Health Problems"></category><category term="null"></category></entry><entry><title>'Why God Allows Handicapped Individuals: Understanding His Divine Plan'</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/god-allow-disabled-handicapped/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-05-24T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-05-24T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-05-24:/god-allow-disabled-handicapped/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;God's Purpose for Disabled and Handicapped Individuals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bible teaches us that God is the creator of all people, including those who are physically disabled or mentally handicapped. While it may be difficult to understand why God allows some individuals to be born with disabilities or to acquire them later …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;God's Purpose for Disabled and Handicapped Individuals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bible teaches us that God is the creator of all people, including those who are physically disabled or mentally handicapped. While it may be difficult to understand why God allows some individuals to be born with disabilities or to acquire them later in life, we can find answers within the framework of the theological/philosophical debate known as "the problem of evil" or "the problem of pain." This debate seeks to reconcile the existence of suffering and brokenness in the world with the goodness and perfection of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1. The Impact of Original Sin&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disabilities and handicaps are a result of the fallen nature of our world, which began with mankind's rebellion against God. Sin entered the world through disobedience, and with it came sickness, imperfection, and disease. While not every disability can be directly attributed to personal sin (as Jesus clarified in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/9/John-9-1.html"&gt;John 9:1&lt;/a&gt;–3), generally speaking, disabilities and handicaps can be traced back to the existence of sin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Recognizing that disabilities are a consequence of living in a fallen world helps us understand that God did not design us to experience such limitations. It points us towards a future where we will be free from these afflictions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; How does understanding the impact of sin on the world shape our perspective on disabilities? How can we show compassion and support to disabled individuals?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2. Displaying God's Works and Glory&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God can use disabilities and handicaps as opportunities to display His works and bring glory to Himself. When Jesus encountered a man who was born blind, He explained that the man's condition existed so "that the works of God might be displayed in him" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/9/John-9-3.html"&gt;John 9:3&lt;/a&gt;). Through healing miracles, Jesus demonstrated His power and authority over physical limitations, leading many to believe in Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, when Lazarus fell ill, Jesus declared that his sickness was for the glory of God, so that people witnessing the miracle of his resurrection would believe (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/11/John-11-4.html"&gt;John 11:4&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Recognizing that God can use disabilities to display His power and bring people to faith encourages us to trust in Him even in the midst of physical limitations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; How can we see God's works and glory displayed through disabled individuals today? How does this challenge our understanding of what it means to be "able-bodied"?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;3. Learning to Trust in God&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God allows disabilities and handicaps to teach us to rely on Him rather than on our own abilities. When God called Moses, who struggled with speech, Moses tried to use his disability as an excuse for not fulfilling God's call. However, God assured Moses that He would help him speak and teach him what to say. In doing so, God demonstrated that all human ability and disability are part of His plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Disabilities remind us that our strength and abilities come from God. They prompt us to trust in His provision and guidance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XuvIkBLy-nM" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; How can we encourage disabled individuals to trust in God's strength and provision? How can we avoid underestimating their abilities or overemphasizing their disabilities?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;4. Weakness as a Means of Strength&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God often chooses the weak and broken things of this world to accomplish His purposes. The apostle Paul writes that God chose the foolish and weak things of the world to shame the wise and strong. By using the lowly and despised things, God nullifies human boasting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Recognizing that God can use disabilities as a means of demonstrating His power challenges societal norms and values. It reminds us that true strength comes from relying on God rather than relying solely on our physical or mental capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; How does society view disabilities, and how can we challenge those perceptions? How can we affirm the value and worth of disabled individuals as bearers of God's image?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;5. Jesus' Identification with Human Weakness&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Jesus came into the world, He voluntarily took on the limitations and vulnerabilities of humanity. He left the perfection of heaven to live among sinners on earth. Jesus experienced human frailty, empathizing with our weaknesses. He suffered on our behalf, ultimately demonstrating His love and sacrifice on the cross.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Understanding that Jesus willingly subjected Himself to weakness and suffering helps us find comfort and hope in His ability to empathize with our struggles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; How does Jesus' identification with human weakness impact your understanding of your own limitations? How can this knowledge deepen your relationship with Him?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;6. The Temporary Nature of Disabilities&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God promises that disabilities and handicaps are temporary in light of eternity. They are part of this fallen world, not the world to come. When Jesus came the first time, He healed the sick, opened blind eyes, unstopped deaf ears, and made the lame leap for joy. These miracles give us a glimpse of the future restoration when Jesus returns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Recognizing that disabilities are temporary encourages us to look forward to a future where all physical limitations will cease to exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; How can the hope of future restoration impact our perspective on disabilities in the present? How can we support disabled individuals by pointing them towards this future hope?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, while it may be challenging to understand why God allows disabilities and handicaps, we can trust that He has a purpose for each individual's circumstances. Disabilities remind us of the impact of sin in the world, provide opportunities for God's works and glory to be displayed, teach us to trust in Him, challenge societal norms, remind us of Jesus' identification with human weakness, and point us towards a future where disabilities will be no more. As we engage with disabled individuals, let us show compassion, support, and a recognition of their inherent value as bearers of God's image.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/God and Evil/Health Problems"></category><category term="null"></category></entry><entry><title>'Divine Healing: Does Sickness Align with God''s Will?'</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/sickness-will-god/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-05-07T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-05-07T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-05-07:/sickness-will-god/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Sickness and the Sovereignty of God&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The concept of sickness and its relationship to the sovereignty of God is an important aspect of Christian theology. The Bible teaches that God is almighty and in complete control of all things, including sickness. However, it is crucial to understand that allowing something to happen and causing something to happen are two different things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we look at the origins of sickness, we can trace it back to the fall of humanity into sin. When Adam and Eve rebelled against God, they brought about all manner of evil, including sickness. Sickness is a manifestation of natural evil, which includes things like natural disasters and physical illnesses. It is a state where good health is missing, a corruption or perversion of the originally good and healthy state of being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While God did not directly cause Adam and Eve to sin, He allowed their rebellion for His own purposes and to bring about His perfect plan. Evil is not caused by God but allowed by Him to exist. The Greek word for evil, ponerous, implies a malignancy that corrupts a good and healthy state of being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Consequences of Sin&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The consequences of Adam's sin affected all of humanity, including the introduction of sickness into the world. In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/8/Romans-8-20.html"&gt;Romans 8:20-22&lt;/a&gt;, it states that creation was subjected to frustration following the fall, not by its own choice but by the will of God. This frustration includes sickness and decay. However, there is hope as creation longs for liberation from its bondage to sin and awaits the glorious freedom that comes through Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to note that until that day of liberation comes, God uses sickness and other forms of evil to fulfill His sovereign purposes, bring glory to Himself, and exalt His holy name. Sometimes, He miraculously heals sickness as we see in the ministry of Jesus who went through Israel healing various illnesses and even raising the dead. Other times, God uses sickness as a form of discipline or judgment against sin, as demonstrated in the cases of King Uzziah and Nebuchadnezzar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Role of Sickness in God's Plan&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MGMRuIVGSNc" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While sickness can be a consequence of our fallen world, our bodies, and poor health choices, it is important to remember that all sickness and disease are allowed by God for His purposes. We may not always understand these purposes, but God is in control. He determines the boundaries of evil, just as He did with Satan in the book of Job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 3 John 2, we see an indication that God desires His people to be in good health. However, even believers may experience sickness and suffering in this life. It is through their suffering that they can glorify God, even if they do not fully understand why He has allowed it. In eternity, when we stand in His presence, all questions will be answered or perhaps become irrelevant as we bask in His glory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the relationship between sickness and the sovereignty of God is essential for our faith. It helps us navigate the challenges of life and suffering. Knowing that God is in control and has a plan even in the midst of sickness gives us hope and comfort. It also reminds us that our ultimate healing comes through Christ and the liberation from sin that He offers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Think About It&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does understanding the sovereignty of God impact your perspective on sickness and suffering?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can we find comfort and hope in knowing that God is in control even in the midst of sickness?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reflect on instances where you have seen God work through sickness or suffering to bring about His purposes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does the concept of God allowing sickness challenge our understanding of His goodness?&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Birth defects are a heartbreaking reality that affects countless individuals and families around the world. These conditions, ranging from structural abnormalities to functional impairments, can have a significant impact on the lives of those born with them. As Christians seeking understanding in the face of such challenges, we turn to the Bible for guidance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Origin of Birth Defects&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The root cause of birth defects can be traced back to the entrance of sin into the world. In the book of Genesis, we learn that when Adam and Eve chose to disobey God, they ushered in a fallen state of existence (Genesis 3). This act not only brought spiritual separation from God but also unleashed a host of physical consequences, including sickness, disease, and death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Birth defects occur as a result of this brokenness in our world, not because of any specific sins committed by parents or babies. It is crucial to understand that birth defects are not punishments for personal wrongdoing. Instead, they are a consequence of sin's pervasive influence on creation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Wrestling with God's Allowance&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One may wonder why God permits birth defects to occur if He is both loving and powerful. The book of Job offers insights into this complex question. In this narrative, God allows Satan to afflict Job and test his faithfulness. Despite enduring immense suffering and loss, Job maintains his trust in God, acknowledging His sovereignty (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Job/13/Job-13-15.html"&gt;Job 13:15&lt;/a&gt;; 1:21).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As humans, we may not always comprehend why God allows certain things to happen. Rather than doubting God's goodness, our response should mirror Job's unwavering trust in Him. We must remember that God is good, just, loving, and merciful, even when circumstances seem contrary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/g6YtUcCQ9c4" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Trusting in God's Wisdom&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we may never fully understand God and His ways, our role is to trust Him wholeheartedly. The Bible encourages us to "Trust in the LORD with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding; in all your ways acknowledge Him, and He will make your paths straight" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Proverbs/3/Proverbs-3-5.html"&gt;Proverbs 3:5-6&lt;/a&gt;). Trusting God means recognizing His unlimited wisdom and submitting ourselves to His plan, even when it is difficult to comprehend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our search for answers, we must remember that sickness, disease, and birth defects are the consequence of sin's presence in our world. However, God has provided a solution for sin through the sacrifice of Jesus Christ (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/5/Romans-5-8.html"&gt;Romans 5:8&lt;/a&gt;). When we enter into a personal relationship with Christ, we can have hope that one day, in heaven, we will be free from these afflictions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;God's Purposes in Suffering&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is natural to question why suffering exists and why God allows it. However, Scripture assures us that God can use even birth defects and other tragedies for our ultimate good and His glory. In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/9/John-9-2.html"&gt;John 9:2-3&lt;/a&gt;, Jesus encounters a man who was born blind. When asked whether the man or his parents were responsible for his condition, Jesus responds, "Neither this man nor his parents sinned... but this happened so that the work of God might be displayed in his life."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This passage reveals that God can bring purpose out of suffering by glorifying Himself through our circumstances. While we may not understand the specifics of how this works, we can trust that God has a greater plan beyond our comprehension.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept of birth defects and their origin matters because it touches upon profound questions about the nature of suffering and God's role in our lives. Understanding that birth defects are a consequence of sin can help us navigate these difficult realities with greater compassion and empathy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recognizing that no one is to blame for birth defects can alleviate feelings of guilt or shame often experienced by parents. It reminds us that our fallen world extends grace to those affected by these conditions, rather than pointing fingers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How does understanding that birth defects are a result of sin impact your perception of individuals born with these conditions?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reflect on times when you have questioned God's allowance of suffering or difficult circumstances. How can the story of Job inspire you to trust God's goodness despite not fully understanding His ways?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In what ways can we demonstrate compassion and support for individuals and families affected by birth defects?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, birth defects are a tragic consequence of sin's entrance into the world. While we may struggle to understand why God allows them, our response should be one of trust in His infinite wisdom and goodness. Through faith, we can find hope in Christ and rest in the assurance that God can use all circumstances, including birth defects, for our ultimate good and His glory.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/God and Evil/Health Problems"></category><category term="null"></category></entry><entry><title>'Miraculous Healing: Can God Restore Amputees? Discover the Truth'</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/god-heal-amputees/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-04-25T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-04-25T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-04-25:/god-heal-amputees/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;God's Healing and Amputees&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question of why God does not heal amputees is often used as an argument against the existence of God. This argument suggests that if God is all-powerful and can answer prayers, then why doesn't He heal amputees? However, this line of reasoning is based on …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;God's Healing and Amputees&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question of why God does not heal amputees is often used as an argument against the existence of God. This argument suggests that if God is all-powerful and can answer prayers, then why doesn't He heal amputees? However, this line of reasoning is based on a skewed view of God and a misinterpretation of Scripture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1. God's Ability to Regenerate Limbs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One false assumption in the "Why won't God heal amputees?" argument is the idea that God has never caused a limb to regenerate. However, it is impossible to conclude that no amputee has ever been healed throughout history just because there is no empirical evidence of limb regeneration. We do have accounts in the Bible of Jesus healing lepers, some of whom may have had missing body parts. Additionally, there are instances of Jesus restoring a shriveled hand and even reattaching a severed ear. The fact that Jesus raised the dead also demonstrates His ability to perform miracles that are even more difficult than healing an amputee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2. The Curse of Sin and Physical Suffering&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Illness, suffering, and pain are consequences of living in a cursed world due to sin. When Adam and Eve sinned, the world fell under a curse, resulting in physical ailments and death. While God's love moved Him to provide a Savior to redeem us from this curse, our ultimate redemption will only be fully realized when sin is completely eradicated from the world. Until then, we are still subject to physical death and its effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;3. God's Definition of Love&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The argument assumes that if God truly loves us, He would heal every disease and infirmity. However, the biblical definition of love is a sacrificial seeking of what is best for the loved one. What is best for us is not always physical wholeness. Sometimes God allows physical suffering and disabilities to teach us important lessons and to grow in our understanding of His grace and power. Just like the apostle Paul, who prayed for his "thorn in the flesh" to be removed but was told by God that His grace was sufficient, we may need to learn that we don't need physical wholeness to experience the sustaining grace of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;4. Miracles in Biblical History&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Miracles, including physical healings, were more common during certain periods in biblical history. Throughout thousands of years covered in the Bible, there were only four short periods when miracles were widely performed: the Exodus, the time of the prophets Elijah and Elisha, the ministry of Jesus, and the time of the apostles. While miracles occurred throughout the Bible, they were not constantly present. Today, any ministry claiming to possess miraculous healing powers should be viewed with caution. While God can still heal people today, it is not as common as some claim it to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;5. Prayer in Jesus' Name&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The argument often misinterprets Jesus' promise that whatever we ask in His name will be done. This promise was specifically given to His apostles and was connected to spreading the gospel after His ascension. It does not mean that we can demand anything we want from God. Praying in Jesus' name implies praying according to His will and for what is best for us. God's wisdom ensures that He will always do what is ultimately best for us, even if it doesn't align with our immediate desires.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;6. The Value of Faith and Eternal Perspective&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While physical suffering may seem unfair, Scripture reminds us that our present sufferings are incomparable to the glory that will be revealed in us. Our physical condition in this world is relatively unimportant compared to our eternal state. Jesus Himself said that it is better for a person to enter life maimed or crippled than to have all their physical abilities and be thrown into eternal fire. Our faith gives us the assurance that God will ultimately make all things right and that our future wholeness is guaranteed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;7. The Assumption of God's Non-Existence&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The underlying assumption behind the argument is that God does not exist, and religion is a myth. However, this assumption is not supported by evidence but serves as a foundational belief for those who use this argument. The question of why God doesn't heal amputees is designed to discredit faith rather than seeking the truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Addressing the question of why God doesn't heal amputees is crucial because it challenges our understanding of God's character and His interaction with the world. By examining this argument from a biblical perspective, we can deepen our faith and trust in God's sovereignty and goodness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider how your understanding of God's healing power may have been influenced by cultural expectations or popular beliefs. Reflect on how Scripture guides us to trust in God's wisdom and goodness, even when our prayers for physical healing are not immediately answered.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/God and Evil/Health Problems"></category><category term="null"></category></entry><entry><title>'Divine Healing: God''s Promise to Restore and Renew'</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/god-heal-everyone/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-04-10T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-04-10T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-04-10:/god-heal-everyone/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;God's Healing: Understanding His Will&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it comes to the topic of God healing everyone, it is important to understand that physical healing is not always God's will. While we may pray and have faith for healing, if it is not in God's plan at that moment, we may not receive physical healing (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-John/5/1-John-5-14.html"&gt;1 John 5:14&lt;/a&gt;). It is crucial to recognize that God's blessings can come in various forms, not just through physical healing. If it were God's will for everyone to be healed, then no one would ever become ill or experience suffering. We cannot attribute someone's illness to a lack of faith, as the Bible shows that even faithful individuals like Paul and Trophimus experienced illness (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/2-Timothy/4/2-Timothy-4-20.html"&gt;2 Timothy 4:20&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/2-Corinthians/12/2-Corinthians-12-7.html"&gt;2 Corinthians 12:7&lt;/a&gt;–9).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, Christians have an oversimplified view of healing. They believe that if they are sick, they only need to ask God for healing, and because God loves them, He will heal them instantly. This perspective often sees healing as proof of a person's faith and God's love. However, this understanding overlooks the truth that parents do not give their children everything they ask for, even if they love them deeply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joni Eareckson Tada has grappled with this issue for many years. She prayed fervently for physical healing from her quadriplegia and had full belief that God would heal her. But she remains in a wheelchair today, forty-five years after her accident. Joni's perspective now reflects great faith as she understands that if God does not remove suffering, He will use it for His purpose and transform individuals through their struggles (Grace to You, October 16, 2013). It is important to recognize that our understanding of healing can be limited and that God works in ways beyond our comprehension.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding that physical healing is not always part of God's plan can help alleviate feelings of guilt or doubt when prayers for healing go unanswered. It allows us to trust in God's sovereignty and recognize that He works in ways that may not align with our desires or expectations. Embracing this perspective can lead to a deeper understanding of the purpose behind suffering and the opportunity for spiritual growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you ever felt disappointed or discouraged when prayers for healing were not answered? How does knowing that physical healing is not always God's will change your perspective on unanswered prayers? Consider how you can find hope and spiritual growth even in the midst of suffering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Healing: A Rare Occurrence&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is essential to recognize that healings, even in the Bible, are rare occurrences. For the first 2,500 years of biblical history, there is no mention of any healings. It is only during the life of Abraham that we potentially see a healing implied (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/12/Genesis-12-17.html"&gt;Genesis 12:17&lt;/a&gt;–20). The next healing mentioned is when Moses cleanses Miriam from leprosy (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Numbers/12/Numbers-12-13.html"&gt;Numbers 12:13&lt;/a&gt;–15). These examples highlight that healings were not a common occurrence throughout biblical history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Old Testament, under the Mosaic Covenant with Israel, there was an emphasis on physicality and material blessings. God promised Israel freedom from disease if they remained faithful to Him (Deuteronomy 28). This context helps us understand the meaning of miracles in the Bible. Healings were signs from God, primarily for the Jews under the Old Covenant, validating the authority of leaders like Moses and confirming the truth of their message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the coming of Christ, we witness the fulfillment of the Mosaic Covenant (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/5/Matthew-5-17.html"&gt;Matthew 5:17&lt;/a&gt;) and a reversal of Israel's spiritual decline. Jesus healed the sick wherever He went, not simply out of kindness but as a sign from heaven, demonstrating His authority as the Messiah (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/7/John-7-31.html"&gt;John 7:31&lt;/a&gt;). These healings allowed Israel to experience a taste of the kingdom of God (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/11/Luke-11-20.html"&gt;Luke 11:20&lt;/a&gt;). However, those who rejected Jesus' authority often remained sick (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/13/Matthew-13-58.html"&gt;Matthew 13:58&lt;/a&gt;). It is important to note that Jesus did not heal everyone but healed specific individuals within a multitude.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The apostles were also given the power to heal the sick, and for thirty-seven years, they went everywhere, performing these miracles as confirmation of the truth of the gospel they proclaimed. However, even the apostles did not heal everyone they encountered. The apostle Paul, for instance, instructed Timothy to use wine for his frequent illnesses (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-Timothy/5/1-Timothy-5-23.html"&gt;1 Timothy 5:23&lt;/a&gt;). This shows that healing was not solely based on an individual's faith but was dependent on God's will.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recognizing that healings were rare occurrences throughout biblical history helps us understand that physical healing is not a guarantee today. It challenges our expectations and encourages us to trust in God's sovereignty. Additionally, it highlights the purpose of miracles as signs from God, validating His message and authority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider your understanding of miracles and healings in the Bible. How does knowing that healings were rare occurrences throughout history change your perspective on miraculous healing today? How might this understanding impact your faith and expectations?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Complexity of God's Will&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our present time, we are not living in the apostolic era when miracles and healings were more prevalent. While God can and does still heal today when He desires to do so, it is crucial to discern what God wants for each individual situation. Sometimes, God may choose to heal someone physically in this life, while other times He may have a different plan to reveal His glory through weakness. Ultimately, all sickness and death will be eradicated when Jesus returns (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Revelation/21/Revelation-21-4.html"&gt;Revelation 21:4&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is essential to remember that physical healing is just one aspect of God's healing. The greater healing that God offers is the cleansing of sinful hearts, which He performs every day. This spiritual healing is available to all who place their faith in Jesus Christ. While physical healing may not always be part of God's plan, the promise of eternal life and spiritual restoration is guaranteed for those who believe in Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding that physical healing is not always God's will enables us to focus on the greater healing that God offers through salvation. It reminds us of the ultimate hope we have in Christ and the promise of eternal life. This perspective can bring comfort and assurance even in the midst of physical suffering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reflect on your understanding of God's will regarding healing. How does knowing that physical healing is not always part of God's plan impact your perspective on suffering and the hope we have in Christ? Consider how you can find peace and comfort in the promise of eternal life and spiritual healing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, when it comes to the topic of God healing everyone, it is important to recognize that physical healing is not always part of His will. While we may pray for healing and have faith, it is crucial to trust in God's sovereignty and understand that His blessings come in various forms. Healing is not solely based on an individual's faith, as even faithful individuals like Paul experienced illness. We must also remember that healings were rare occurrences throughout biblical history, serving as signs from God to validate His message and authority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our present time, as we await Jesus' return, physical healing may or may not be part of God's plan for each situation. However, the greater healing that God offers is the cleansing of sinful hearts through faith in Jesus Christ. This spiritual restoration is available to all who believe, providing hope and assurance even in the midst of physical suffering. Let us trust in God's will, knowing that He works beyond our understanding and has a purpose for every circumstance.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/God and Evil/Health Problems"></category><category term="null"></category></entry></feed>

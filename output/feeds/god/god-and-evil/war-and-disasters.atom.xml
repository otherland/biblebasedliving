&lt;p&gt;On September 11, 2001, our world was forever changed by the tragic events that unfolded. Many people asked the question: Where was God in the midst of this terrible tragedy?

&lt;p&gt;On September 11, 2001, our world was forever changed by the tragic events that unfolded. Many people asked the question: Where was God in the midst of this terrible tragedy? As Christians, we believe that God is always present and in control, even in the face of evil and suffering. While it may be difficult to comprehend why a loving God would allow such a tragedy to happen, we must remember that God's ways are higher than our ways and His thoughts are higher than our thoughts (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/55/Isaiah-55-9.html"&gt;Isaiah 55:9&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Reality of Human Sinfulness&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To understand why God allows evil and suffering in our world, we must first acknowledge the reality of human sinfulness. The Bible tells us that all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/3/Romans-3-23.html"&gt;Romans 3:23&lt;/a&gt;). Humanity is desperately wicked and sinful (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/3/Romans-3-10.html"&gt;Romans 3:10-18&lt;/a&gt;). God allows human beings to commit sin for His own reasons and to fulfill His own purposes. This does not mean that God is responsible for the wicked acts of evil men.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;God's Eternal Perspective&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God looks at things from an eternal perspective, while we often view things from an earthly perspective. We may wonder why God allowed Adam and Eve to sin and bring evil, death, and suffering upon all mankind. However, it is important to remember that the purpose of all creation and all creatures is to glorify God. God is glorified when His nature and attributes are displayed. If there were no sin, God would have no opportunity to display His justice and wrath as He punishes sin. Nor would He have the opportunity to show His grace, mercy, and love to undeserving creatures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ultimate display of God's grace was seen at the Cross, where Jesus died for our sins. Here, unselfishness and obedience were displayed in God's Son, who knew no sin but was made sin for us so that we might become the righteousness of God in Him (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/2-Corinthians/5/2-Corinthians-5-21.html"&gt;2 Corinthians 5:21&lt;/a&gt;). This was all to the praise of His glory (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Ephesians/1/Ephesians-1-14.html"&gt;Ephesians 1:14&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Recognizing the Miracles Amidst Tragedy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When reflecting on September 11, it is easy to focus solely on the tragedy and forget the miracles that occurred that day. Despite the devastation, there were countless instances where lives were saved and people were able to escape just in time. These miracles remind us that God was present even amidst the chaos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, a small group of firemen and one civilian survived in a tiny stairwell as one of the towers collapsed around them. The passengers on Flight 93 fought against the terrorists, preventing further destruction. These are just a few examples of the numerous miracles that took place that day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tpBLlbzE2xg" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding God's sovereignty and purpose in the midst of tragedy is crucial for our faith. It reminds us that God is always in control, even when things seem out of control. Moreover, it helps us trust in His wisdom and goodness, even when we cannot fully comprehend His ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we reflect on September 11, let us not only remember the tragedy but also the stories of hope and resilience. Let us be reminded of the countless lives that have been changed for the better since that day. It is possible that many people have turned to Christ and found salvation as a result of what happened. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When faced with difficult circumstances or tragedies in our own lives, may we find comfort in knowing that God is with us. Let us trust in His sovereignty and have faith that He works all things together for good to those who love Him and are called according to His purpose (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/8/Romans-8-28.html"&gt;Romans 8:28&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/God and Evil/War and Disasters"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Ultimate Comparison: Hitler vs Saddam - Lessons for Christian Faith</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/hitler-saddam/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-09-02T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-09-02T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-09-02:/hitler-saddam/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;God's Sovereignty over Rulers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Bible, it is clear that God is sovereign over everything, including the rulers of nations. This means that He is ultimately in control of all things, big and small. The Bible tells us that God is in control of the weather (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/148/Psalm-148-8.html"&gt;Psalm 148:8 …&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;God's Sovereignty over Rulers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Bible, it is clear that God is sovereign over everything, including the rulers of nations. This means that He is ultimately in control of all things, big and small. The Bible tells us that God is in control of the weather (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/148/Psalm-148-8.html"&gt;Psalm 148:8&lt;/a&gt;), life and death (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/104/Psalm-104-29.html"&gt;Psalm 104:29-30&lt;/a&gt;), and even seemingly inconsequential happenings (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Proverbs/16/Proverbs-16-33.html"&gt;Proverbs 16:33&lt;/a&gt;). His sovereignty extends to the rulers of nations as well. The book of Daniel tells us that God sets up kings and deposes them, and He has the power to change times and seasons (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Daniel/2/Daniel-2-20.html"&gt;Daniel 2:20-21&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One example of God's sovereignty over rulers is seen in the life of Cyrus the Great. God called Cyrus by name and promised to set him on the throne of Persia one hundred and fifty years before his birth (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/45/Isaiah-45-13.html"&gt;Isaiah 45:13&lt;/a&gt;). This shows that God had a plan for Cyrus, a pagan ruler, and used him for His purposes. The book of Romans also affirms God's sovereignty over rulers, stating that there is no authority except that which God has established (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/13/Romans-13-1.html"&gt;Romans 13:1&lt;/a&gt;). This statement was written during the time of Nero, a wicked ruler who persecuted Christians. Despite Nero's evil actions, Paul did not question why God allowed him to be in power. Instead, he recognized that all authorities are established by God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding God's sovereignty over rulers helps us to trust in His plan even when we see evil leaders in positions of authority. It reminds us that nothing happens without God's knowledge and permission. It also encourages us to pray for our leaders, knowing that ultimately their actions are subject to God's control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If God is sovereign over rulers, how does this impact our responsibility as citizens? How should we respond when we disagree with the actions of our leaders? How can we pray for our rulers in light of God's sovereignty?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;God's Purpose in Allowing Evil Rulers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it may be difficult to understand why God allows evil rulers to come into power, the Bible provides some insights into His purposes. At times, God has used evil rulers to bring judgment on His people and to bring them back to righteousness. For example, God raised up Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon to punish Judah for their idolatry (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/2-Kings/20/2-Kings-20-17.html"&gt;2 Kings 20:17-18&lt;/a&gt;). However, it is important to note that all rulers are accountable to God for their actions. Babylon, for instance, was later judged for its own wickedness (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/13/Isaiah-13-19.html"&gt;Isaiah 13:19&lt;/a&gt;; 14:4), and Nebuchadnezzar himself faced individual judgment (Daniel 4).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assyria is another example of a nation that God allowed to rise for a purpose but later judged for its pride and cruelty (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/10/Isaiah-10-5.html"&gt;Isaiah 10:5-19&lt;/a&gt;). These examples remind us that while God may use evil rulers for His purposes, there will be a day of reckoning for their actions. Human rulers are not omnipotent or eternal, and they are not immune from punishment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding God's purpose in allowing evil rulers helps us to trust that He has a greater plan beyond our understanding. It also reminds us that no ruler is beyond the reach of God's justice and judgment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z9Ibc_1Hm_U" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Think About It:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How does knowing that God will hold rulers accountable impact our perspective on justice in this world? How can we find hope and comfort in the knowledge that there will be a day of reckoning for those who have abused their power?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Role of Evil Rulers in the Expansion of the Church&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some instances, evil rulers have inadvertently played a role in the growth and spread of the church. The early church faced persecution from governing authorities, which led to the scattering of believers and the spread of the gospel. Acts 8 recounts how a persecution against the early church in Jerusalem resulted in believers being scattered throughout Judea and Samaria (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Acts/8/Acts-8-1.html"&gt;Acts 8:1&lt;/a&gt;). This dispersion contributed to the fulfillment of the Great Commission and the growth of the church.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While persecution is never God's desired plan for His people, He can use difficult circumstances and evil rulers to accomplish His purposes. The example of the early church reminds us that even in the face of opposition, God can bring about good and advance His kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding how God can work through difficult circumstances and evil rulers encourages us to trust His plan even in times of persecution. It reminds us that God can bring beauty out of brokenness and use even the darkest situations for His glory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How does knowing that God can use evil rulers for His purposes impact our response to persecution? How can we find hope and encouragement in the knowledge that God is still at work even in the midst of difficult circumstances?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Accountability of Evil Rulers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although God allows evil rulers to come into power, they are not exempt from accountability. The Bible teaches that all rulers will be held responsible for their actions. Ultimately, those who die in their sins will face eternal punishment in hell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is worth noting that eternity in hell is not limited to specific individuals like Hitler or Saddam Hussein. Rather, it is a fate that awaits all who reject Christ and abuse the people of God. While we may not fully comprehend why God allows evil rulers to exist or why they are not immediately judged, we can trust that there will be a day when justice will be served.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the accountability of evil rulers reminds us that no one is above God's judgment. It also reinforces the importance of our own personal accountability before God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How does the accountability of evil rulers affect our own understanding of justice? How can we find comfort and hope in the knowledge that God will ultimately bring justice to all?&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/God and Evil/War and Disasters"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Why Did God Allow the Holocaust: Divine Purpose Revealed</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/god-allow-holocaust/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-06-15T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-06-15T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-06-15:/god-allow-holocaust/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;God's Allowance of Evil in the World&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem of evil is a challenging issue that many believers grapple with. We often ask ourselves, "Why does God allow evil to exist?" This question becomes even more difficult when we consider atrocities like the Holocaust.

&lt;p&gt;The problem of evil is a challenging issue that many believers grapple with. We often ask ourselves, "Why does God allow evil to exist?" This question becomes even more difficult when we consider atrocities like the Holocaust. Could God have prevented such a horrific event? The answer is yes, He could have. However, it is essential to understand that God's allowance of evil does not mean He approves of it. In fact, God is grieved by the sinfulness and hardness of human hearts (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/6/Genesis-6-6.html"&gt;Genesis 6:6&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/3/Mark-3-5.html"&gt;Mark 3:5&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Mystery of God's Ways&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God's ways and thoughts are infinitely higher than ours (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/55/Isaiah-55-8.html"&gt;Isaiah 55:8-9&lt;/a&gt;). His sovereign plan encompasses the entire scope of history, including every possible cause and effect, potentiality, and contingency. We cannot fathom the intricacies of His design. It is a matter of faith to trust that His plan is the best possible way to restore fallen humanity and a cursed world to righteousness and blessing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;God's Permission and Approval&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NW2dgvRi8lA" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is important to differentiate between God's permission and His approval. Just as God allowed Adam to eat from the forbidden tree without approving of his action, God permits evil actions to occur while disapproving of them. The Holocaust was a result of mankind's continued rebellion against God. While nothing can justify the evil of the Holocaust, we can find solace in knowing that God has done everything possible to redeem humanity from sin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Role of Human Responsibility&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The blame for the Holocaust lies squarely on the shoulders of sinful humanity. It was the product of sinful choices made by individuals in rebellion against a holy God. The rise of Nazism and the subsequent horrors were facilitated by millions who followed Hitler and his destructive policies. Additionally, the silence and acquiescence of many churches and world leaders during this time allowed the Holocaust to unfold. The question then becomes, not why did God allow it, but why did we?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Freedom of Choice&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God has given mankind freedom of choice. We can choose to follow Him and stand for righteousness or rebel against Him and pursue evil. The problem lies in the heart of man, which is deceitful above all things and beyond cure (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Jeremiah/17/Jeremiah-17-9.html"&gt;Jeremiah 17:9&lt;/a&gt;). Until humanity's heart turns to God, the world will continue to witness acts of evil like ethnic cleansings, genocides, and atrocities such as the Holocaust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question of why God allows evil is a significant theological issue that challenges our understanding of His nature and His role in the world. Wrestling with this question deepens our faith and forces us to trust in God's wisdom and sovereignty. It can also lead us to reflect on our own responsibility in the face of evil and injustice, encouraging us to take a stand for righteousness and justice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Think About It&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does understanding God's permission versus approval help you reconcile the existence of evil in the world?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reflect on the role of human responsibility in allowing evil to occur. How can we learn from history to prevent similar atrocities in the future?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consider how your understanding of God's sovereignty affects your faith. How does trusting in His plan bring comfort even in the face of evil?&lt;/li&gt;

While we …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Canaanites Extermination&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The extermination of the Canaanites by the Israelites is a topic that raises difficult questions and challenges our understanding of God's character. In order to fully grasp the reasoning behind this command, it is important to examine the biblical context and the reasons given in Scripture. While we may not fully comprehend God's ways, we can seek to understand His purposes as revealed in His Word.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Wickedness of the Canaanites&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One reason given in Scripture for the extermination of the Canaanites is their extreme wickedness. The Canaanite culture was marked by heinous sins and abominable practices, including incest, child sacrifice, homosexuality, and bestiality. Leviticus 18 provides a list of these sins that Israel was commanded to avoid at all costs. The land itself had become defiled by the sinful practices of its inhabitants. In ordering the destruction of the Canaanites, God enacted a form of corporate capital punishment on a people that had been deserving of judgment for some time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Preventing Idolatry and Compromise&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another reason for the extermination of the Canaanites was to prevent religious compromise and spiritual adultery. God warned that if the Israelites left survivors among the Canaanites, they would be led astray and tempted to follow their detestable practices. The Israelites were prone to compromise with Canaanite culture and fell into idolatry time and again. By completely eradicating the Canaanite nations, God sought to protect His relationship with His chosen people and guard them from spiritual harm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Future Problems Averted&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God's knowledge of the future played a role in His command to exterminate certain people groups. He knew that if Israel did not completely eradicate their enemies, there would be future problems. The Amalekites, although not Canaanites themselves, attacked Israel multiple times and formed alliances with the Canaanites. King Saul was given the responsibility to exterminate the Amalekites, but he failed to fully obey God's command. As a result, several decades later, the Amalekites were able to take captives from David and his men. Furthermore, a descendant of the Amalekites, Haman, sought to exterminate the entire Jewish people in the time of Esther. The incomplete obedience of Saul almost resulted in Israel's destruction. God's command to eliminate these groups was intended to prevent future harm and preserve the well-being of His people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lu1EYXr0Me4" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Fulfillment of a Curse&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Centuries before the command to exterminate the Canaanites, Noah had pronounced a curse on one of Ham's sons, Canaan. This curse declared that Canaan would be the lowest of slaves to his brothers. Canaan was the ancestor of the Canaanite people. When Joshua led the Israelites into Canaan, they conquered the Canaanite nations as part of their inheritance. Not all of the Canaanites were exterminated; some became slaves as Noah's prophecy was fulfilled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Understanding Difficult Aspects&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most challenging aspects of God's command to exterminate the Canaanites is that women and children were not spared. It is crucial to approach this issue with care and consider several points:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No one is innately innocent or sinless. Scripture teaches that all have sinned and fallen short of God's glory (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/51/Psalm-51-5.html"&gt;Psalm 51:5&lt;/a&gt;; 58:3). The women and children in Canaan were participants in the sinful practices of their culture, and allowing them to live would have perpetuated those practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The children would have grown up sympathetic to evil religions and practices. By eliminating them, God prevented future generations from continuing in the same wickedness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These children would have likely harbored resentment toward the Israelites and sought revenge for the perceived injustice against their fathers. This would have perpetuated a cycle of violence and hostility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although we may struggle to fully comprehend God's actions, we must recognize His sovereignty over all life. He alone has the right to give and take life, and how and when we die is ultimately up to Him. In the case of the Canaanites, God had given them ample time to repent, but they remained resistant to Him. Their destruction served as a form of judgment for their persistent wickedness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The extermination of the Canaanites raises significant theological questions about God's character and His dealings with humanity. Understanding the reasons behind this command can help us grapple with these difficult questions and deepen our trust in God's wisdom and justice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How does the wickedness of the Canaanites challenge our understanding of God's grace and mercy?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What lessons can we learn from God's command to exterminate the Canaanites about the seriousness of sin and the need for repentance?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How does God's role as judge reflect His commitment to righteousness and justice?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can we reconcile the command to exterminate the Canaanites with the biblical teaching on love, compassion, and forgiveness?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In what ways can we apply the lessons from this biblical account to our own lives today?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The issue of violence in the Old Testament has long been a topic of controversy and criticism. Critics argue that the God of the Old Testament is portrayed as a vindictive and bloodthirsty deity, commanding genocide and indiscriminate massacre. However, it is essential to examine whether these criticisms are valid, or if there may be morally sufficient reasons behind God's commands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Canaanite Culture&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A basic understanding of Canaanite culture reveals its inherent moral wickedness. The Canaanites were a brutal and aggressive people who engaged in practices such as bestiality, incest, and even child sacrifice. Their deviant sexual acts were considered normal. God's judgment was primarily directed at the Canaanite religion rather than the people themselves. It is important to note that individual Canaanites who repented could find mercy (Joshua 2). God's desire is for the wicked to turn from their sins rather than face destruction (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Ezekiel/18/Ezekiel-18-31.html"&gt;Ezekiel 18:31&lt;/a&gt;–32; 33:11).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Role of Israel in God's Plan&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God used the conquest of Canaan to create a religious and historical context in which He could introduce the Messiah to the world. This Messiah would bring salvation not only to Israel but also to Israel's enemies, including Canaan (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/87/Psalm-87-4.html"&gt;Psalm 87:4&lt;/a&gt;–6; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/7/Mark-7-25.html"&gt;Mark 7:25&lt;/a&gt;–30). The purpose of this conquest was not only to punish the sinful nations but also to bring about redemption and salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Time for Repentance&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is worth noting that God gave the Canaanite people over 400 years to repent of their evil ways. The book of Hebrews refers to them as "disobedient," suggesting moral culpability on their part (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/11/Hebrews-11-31.html"&gt;Hebrews 11:31&lt;/a&gt;). The Canaanites were aware of God's power and had the opportunity to seek repentance. Unfortunately, they continued their rebellion against God until the end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Killing Non-Combatants&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Critics often point out that God commanded the Israelites to kill non-combatants. While it is true that the Canaanite women did not fight, their seductive behavior in Numbers 25 indicates their participation in the sinful practices of their culture (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Numbers/25/Numbers-25-1.html"&gt;Numbers 25:1&lt;/a&gt;–3). Additionally, it is important to recognize that no human person, including infants, is truly innocent. Scripture teaches that all people are born in sin (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/51/Psalm-51-5.html"&gt;Psalm 51:5&lt;/a&gt;; 58:3). Infants are as morally culpable for Adam's sin as adults are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;God's Sovereignty Over Life&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God is sovereign over all life and has the right to give or take it as He sees fit. He ultimately takes every person's life at death. While it is wrong for humans to take a life, except in cases of capital punishment, war, and self-defense, it does not mean that it is wrong for God to do so. God alone has the authority to determine when and how life ends. Ultimately, our lives belong to Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Consideration for Children&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FPyjIMn5-yg" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One might argue that it would have been cruel for God to spare only the infants and children of Canaan, as they would have faced death due to starvation without the protection and support of their parents. Moreover, these children would likely have grown up sympathetic to the evil religions practiced by their parents. By ending the culture of idolatry and perversion in Canaan, God sought to protect future generations from continuing in those sinful practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Eternal State of Infants&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fate of the infants killed in Canaan raises questions about their eternal state. If God took them before reaching moral accountability, they would have gone straight to heaven. In this view, those children are in a far better place than if they had lived into adulthood as Canaanites. It is essential to trust in God's justice and mercy, even in difficult and complex situations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the violence in the Old Testament is crucial for believers as it helps us grapple with challenging theological questions. It allows us to explore God's character and His ways, recognizing that His perspective is eternal and beyond our understanding. By examining the context and reasons behind God's commands, we can deepen our faith and trust in His sovereignty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does knowing the moral wickedness of the Canaanite culture affect your understanding of God's judgment?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are some possible reasons why God commanded the destruction of Canaan?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does the concept of God's sovereignty over life challenge or strengthen your faith?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reflect on the eternal state of infants killed in Canaan. How does this perspective influence your understanding of God's justice and mercy?&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Natural disasters such as earthquakes, tornadoes, hurricanes, tsunamis, typhoons, cyclones, mudslides, wildfires, and others often lead people to question God's goodness. While tragedies like the 2023 earthquake in Turkey and Syria may shake our faith, it is essential to seek a deeper understanding of why God allows these events to occur. In this article, we will explore the reasons behind natural disasters from a biblical perspective and uncover how God can bring good out of terrible tragedies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Laws of Nature&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God created the entire universe and established the laws of nature (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/1/Genesis-1-1.html"&gt;Genesis 1:1&lt;/a&gt;). Many natural disasters are a consequence of these laws at work. For example, hurricanes, typhoons, and tornadoes result from colliding weather patterns. Earthquakes occur when the earth's plate structure shifts, while tsunamis are caused by underwater earthquakes. Therefore, it is crucial to recognize that most natural disasters are not direct acts of God but rather the result of the physical processes He put in place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Christ's Role in Nature&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bible teaches that Jesus Christ holds all of nature together (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Colossians/1/Colossians-1-16.html"&gt;Colossians 1:16-17&lt;/a&gt;). This means that even amidst natural disasters, God remains sovereign and in control. While God could prevent these events if He desired, there are instances where He does influence the weather (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Deuteronomy/11/Deuteronomy-11-17.html"&gt;Deuteronomy 11:17&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/James/5/James-5-17.html"&gt;James 5:17&lt;/a&gt;). Furthermore, Scripture reveals that God sometimes uses natural disasters as a form of judgment against sin (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Numbers/16/Numbers-16-30.html"&gt;Numbers 16:30-34&lt;/a&gt;). The book of Revelation also describes events that can be seen as natural disasters (Revelation chapters 6, 8, and 16).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Consequences of Sin&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to understand that not every natural disaster is a punishment from God. Similar to how God allows evil people to commit evil acts, He also allows the earth to reflect the consequences of sin. &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/8/Romans-8-19.html"&gt;Romans 8:19-21&lt;/a&gt; explains that creation waits for the redemption of God's children, as it was subjected to frustration and decay due to humanity's fall into sin. Sin is the underlying cause of natural disasters, just as it is responsible for death, disease, and suffering. Therefore, we must acknowledge that natural disasters are a result of living in a fallen world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Shaking Our Priorities&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One reason why God allows natural disasters is to shake our confidence in this temporary life and remind us of eternity. When disasters strike, they force us to confront the fragile nature of our existence. The uncertainty and devastation prompt many people to reevaluate their priorities and seek spiritual answers. It is often after such events that churches experience an influx of people seeking solace and understanding. These tragedies can lead individuals to recognize the brevity of life and consider their eternal destiny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding why God allows natural disasters is essential for believers. It helps us maintain our faith during difficult times and prepares us to minister to those affected by such events. Recognizing that God remains sovereign even in the face of tragedy provides comfort and reassurance that He can bring good out of terrible circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;God's Miracles in Disasters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While natural disasters can be devastating, many amazing miracles occur during these events, often preventing even greater loss of life. These miracles serve as a reminder of God's presence and intervention amidst the chaos. They demonstrate that even in the darkest moments, God can bring hope and salvation. These miraculous occurrences also showcase His power over creation and His ability to work through human circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Responding with Compassion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Natural disasters offer an opportunity for Christians to demonstrate compassion and love towards those affected. When these tragedies strike, millions of people worldwide mobilize to send aid and support to those suffering. Christian ministries play a vital role in responding to disasters, providing practical assistance, ministering to emotional needs, offering counsel, and leading people to saving faith in Christ. These acts of kindness and service showcase the love of God and become a powerful witness to those who are hurting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Think About It:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider the impact of natural disasters on your own life and the lives of others. How do these events shape your perspective and priorities? In what ways can you respond with compassion and share the hope of Christ in the midst of tragedy?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;God's Goodness in Tragedy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we face natural disasters, it is essential to remember that God is good (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/100/Psalm-100-5.html"&gt;Psalm 100:5&lt;/a&gt;). Although we may not fully comprehend why He allows these events, we can trust that His character remains constant. Despite the pain and suffering caused by natural disasters, God can bring about great good from terrible tragedies (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/8/Romans-8-28.html"&gt;Romans 8:28&lt;/a&gt;). It is through these difficult circumstances that individuals are often prompted to seek Him, find salvation, experience His provision, and witness His miraculous works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, natural disasters hold a complex place within God's plan. While they are not direct acts of God, they are a consequence of living in a fallen world affected by sin. Understanding this perspective allows us to navigate these events with faith and compassion. As believers, we can trust that even in the midst of tragedy, God remains sovereign and can bring about good from even the most devastating circumstances. Let us respond with love, support, and a steadfast faith that shines brightly in times of darkness.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/God and Evil/War and Disasters"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry></feed>

&lt;p&gt;The concept of the Trinity is a fundamental belief in Christianity. It teaches that there is one God who exists in three distinct Persons: God the Father, God the Son (Jesus Christ), and God the Holy Spirit. While this concept may be difficult to fully comprehend, it is accepted by faith because it is taught in the Bible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1. The Trinity: One God in Three Persons&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the Bible, there is only one God (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Deuteronomy/6/Deuteronomy-6-4.html"&gt;Deuteronomy 6:4&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-Corinthians/8/1-Corinthians-8-6.html"&gt;1 Corinthians 8:6&lt;/a&gt;). However, this one God exists eternally as three Persons: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/28/Matthew-28-19.html"&gt;Matthew 28:19&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/3/Luke-3-21.html"&gt;Luke 3:21&lt;/a&gt;–22; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/2-Corinthians/13/2-Corinthians-13-14.html"&gt;2 Corinthians 13:14&lt;/a&gt;). Each Person of the Trinity is equal and eternal, with no one being inferior to another (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/1/John-1-1.html"&gt;John 1:1&lt;/a&gt;–2). They share the same essence and nature. The Athanasian Creed expresses it as "In this Trinity, no one is before or after, greater or less than the other; but all three persons are in themselves, coeternal and coequal; and so we must worship the Trinity in unity and the one God in three persons."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Understanding the nature of God as a triune being deepens our appreciation for His complexity and unity. It also helps us grasp the relational aspect of God's existence, with each Person of the Trinity having a distinct role.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; Just as water can exist as a liquid, solid (ice), or gas (steam) while retaining its essential nature as H2O, so too does God exist as three Persons while remaining one God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2. God the Father: The First Person of the Trinity&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God the Father is the first Person of the Trinity and serves as its functional head. While He is an infinite, personal Spirit (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/4/John-4-24.html"&gt;John 4:24&lt;/a&gt;), the term "Father" has been used to identify Him from eternity past. He is referred to as "Father" in relation to His Son (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/3/John-3-16.html"&gt;John 3:16&lt;/a&gt;–17) and His chosen people (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Exodus/4/Exodus-4-22.html"&gt;Exodus 4:22&lt;/a&gt;–23; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-Corinthians/1/1-Corinthians-1-3.html"&gt;1 Corinthians 1:3&lt;/a&gt;). It is important to note that God the Father is neither male nor female, but Scripture uses masculine pronouns to portray His parental closeness and authoritative role as God. Some passages in the Bible also describe God the Father using feminine imagery, which displays His tender care and concern for His people (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/66/Isaiah-66-13.html"&gt;Isaiah 66:13&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/23/Matthew-23-37.html"&gt;Matthew 23:37&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Recognizing God the Father's character and roles helps us approach Him with reverence, gratitude, and trust. It emphasizes His love for us as His children and His desire for an intimate relationship with us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; Just as a loving father provides guidance, protection, and provision for his children, so too does God the Father care for His creation and provide for the needs of His children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;3. The Functional Head of the Trinity&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While God the Father is not superior in essence or being to the Son or the Holy Spirit, He serves as the functional head of the Trinity. Both God the Son and God the Holy Spirit voluntarily submit to Him on a functional level to accomplish the will of God (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/14/John-14-24.html"&gt;John 14:24&lt;/a&gt;–26, 20:21). God the Son is eternally begotten by God the Father and is sent from Him alone (John 17), while God the Holy Spirit proceeds from God the Father through the Son (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/15/John-15-26.html"&gt;John 15:26&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Understanding this functional hierarchy within the Trinity helps us comprehend how each Person of the Trinity works together in unity to fulfill their unique roles in creation, redemption, and sanctification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Xv4gAj3SL4I" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; Just as a well-coordinated team has a captain who directs the actions of the players, so too does God the Father direct the will of God the Son and God the Holy Spirit to accomplish His purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;4. The Author of All Divine Acts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the functional head of the Trinity, God the Father can be understood as the author of all acts of God. He is the one who created the heavens and the earth (Genesis 1-2), and He did this through God the Son by the power of God the Holy Spirit (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/1/Genesis-1-1.html"&gt;Genesis 1:1&lt;/a&gt;–2; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Colossians/1/Colossians-1-16.html"&gt;Colossians 1:16&lt;/a&gt;). He is also the source for all other divine acts, including election, calling, salvation, sanctification, glorification, and more. &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/11/Romans-11-36.html"&gt;Romans 11:36&lt;/a&gt; says, "For from Him and through Him and to Him are all things. To Him be the glory forever. Amen" (ESV).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Recognizing God the Father as the ultimate source and authority behind all divine acts helps us trust in His sovereignty, wisdom, and goodness. It reminds us that everything exists for His glory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; Just as an architect envisions and designs a building, which is then constructed by contractors and brought to completion according to the architect's plans, so too does God the Father author and oversee all divine acts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;5. Revealed through Jesus Christ&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through His life and ministry, Jesus frequently taught His followers about who God the Father is and what He is like. The Gospel narratives provide us with a clear picture of God the Father. We learn that God is a Father who deeply loves His children (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/16/John-16-27.html"&gt;John 16:27&lt;/a&gt;); He is to be prayed to (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/6/Matthew-6-6.html"&gt;Matthew 6:6&lt;/a&gt;); He is the source of salvation for all who come through Jesus (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/14/John-14-6.html"&gt;John 14:6&lt;/a&gt;); and He has a will that we should seek after (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/6/John-6-38.html"&gt;John 6:38&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Jesus' teachings about God the Father help us understand His character, desires, and intentions. They guide us in our relationship with Him and inform our understanding of the nature of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; Just as a child learns about their father's character, desires, and will through their interactions and conversations, so too do we learn about God the Father through Jesus' teachings and our personal relationship with Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding God the Father as the first Person of the Trinity and the functional head of the Godhead provides us with a deeper comprehension of His roles, character, and relationships within the Trinity. While our understanding may be limited, we can trust in His infinite wisdom, love, and sovereignty. Through Jesus Christ, we can experience a personal relationship with God the Father, approaching Him as a loving Father who desires to be intimately involved in our lives. May we seek to know Him more deeply and honor Him in all that we do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The concept of the Trinity refers to the belief that there is one God who exists in three distinct persons. The Bible teaches that these three persons, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, are coexistent and co-eternal. Jesus is considered the second person …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Second Person of the Trinity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept of the Trinity refers to the belief that there is one God who exists in three distinct persons. The Bible teaches that these three persons, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, are coexistent and co-eternal. Jesus is considered the second person of the Trinity because he is mentioned second in the "Trinitarian formula" found in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/28/Matthew-28-19.html"&gt;Matthew 28:19&lt;/a&gt;. This formula is used in the Great Commission, where Jesus instructs his disciples to baptize new believers "in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to note that using terms like first, second, and third when referring to the persons of the Trinity does not imply a difference in their importance. The Athanasian Creed, an early summary of Christian doctrine on the Trinity, emphasizes that while there are three distinct persons, they share the same nature and substance. The creed states, "There is one Person of the Father, another of the Son, and another of the Holy Spirit. But the godhead of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, is all one, the glory equal, the majesty co-eternal... In the Trinity none is before or after another; none is greater or less than another, but all three Persons are co-eternal together and co-equal."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although Jesus is not inferior to the Father, he willingly submitted himself to the Father's will. He is called the second person of the Trinity because he took on human nature and lived in total obedience to God the Father. &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Philippians/2/Philippians-2-6.html"&gt;Philippians 2:6-8&lt;/a&gt; describes this submission: "Who, being in very nature God, did not consider equality with God something to be used to his own advantage; rather, he made himself nothing by taking the very nature of a servant, being made in human likeness. And being found in appearance as a man, he humbled himself by becoming obedient to death—even death on a cross!" In the "economic Trinity," which refers to how God has revealed himself and interacts with humanity, Jesus holds a second position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VM2UE6MIKzM" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through his obedience as the Son, Jesus accomplished our salvation and is now exalted at the right hand of the Father. &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/1/Hebrews-1-3.html"&gt;Hebrews 1:3&lt;/a&gt; affirms this: "The Son is the radiance of God’s glory and the exact representation of his being, sustaining all things by his powerful word. After he had provided purification for sins, he sat down at the right hand of the Majesty in heaven."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the concept of the second person of the Trinity is essential to grasp the fullness of God's revelation and his plan of salvation. By recognizing Jesus as the second person in the Trinity, we acknowledge his divine nature and his role in our redemption. It also helps us appreciate the depth of his humility and obedience in taking on human form and submitting to God's will. Recognizing Jesus' exaltation to the right hand of the Father reminds us of his authority and power over all things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider the significance of Jesus willingly submitting himself to God's plan of salvation. How does this act of humility impact your understanding of who Jesus is and what he has done for you? How does recognizing Jesus as the second person of the Trinity shape your perspective on his authority and role in your life? Take a moment to reflect on these truths and thank God for sending Jesus to redeem you.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/The Nature of God/The Trinity"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Discover the Ultimate Truth: One True God Revealed</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/one-true-god/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-09-08T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-09-08T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-09-08:/one-true-god/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;The One True God&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question of the one true God is of utmost importance as it pertains to our understanding of the divine and our relationship with Him. In a world filled with various gods and belief systems, distinguishing the one true God becomes crucial. While false gods are creations of human imagination and hold no real power, the one true God is full of glory, grace, and truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Attributes of the One True God&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the Bible, the one true God is the sovereign Creator of the universe, existing independently of anything else. He is a spiritual being, eternal in nature, and possesses personal qualities. Unlike the numerous false gods found in different religions, the one true God encompasses all knowledge, power, and is omnipresent. Furthermore, He is unchanging, just, loving, truthful, holy, compassionate, merciful, gracious, and forgiving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Triune Nature of God&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The one true God is unique in His triune nature. The Bible reveals that within the divine essence exists three distinct Persons: the Father, the Son (Jesus Christ), and the Holy Spirit. This triunity sets Him apart from other monotheistic religions like Islam. Denying Jesus Christ denies a relationship with the Father as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LNYr2fSToA4" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The Revelation of the One True God&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The one true God desires to be known by humanity. He has revealed Himself throughout history in various ways. Creation itself displays His power and glory. He established a covenant with Abraham and his descendants, forming them into a new nation. Later on, He revealed Himself to Moses and began to disclose His nature through His written Word, the Bible. Ultimately, God provided the ultimate revelation of Himself in Jesus Christ—God made flesh—who dwelt among us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Choosing the One True God&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all have a choice when it comes to whom we worship. Just as Joshua called upon the Israelites to choose between the one true God and the gods of the Amorites, we too must make a decision. The worship of false deities only leads to death, while knowing and following the one true God leads to eternal life. We can learn from Ruth, who chose the one true God over the idols of Moab.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the identity of the one true God is crucial for our faith and relationship with Him. It helps us discern between truth and falsehood, guiding us away from worshiping false gods. Knowing the attributes of the one true God enables us to trust in His justice, love, truthfulness, holiness, compassion, mercy, grace, and forgiveness. Recognizing His triune nature allows us to have a complete understanding of His character. Ultimately, choosing to worship the one true God opens up the path to eternal life through Jesus Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Think About It&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does recognizing the attributes of the one true God impact your understanding of His character and your relationship with Him?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In what ways can you actively choose to worship the one true God in your daily life?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consider the significance of Jesus Christ as the ultimate revelation of the one true God. How does this affect your perspective on salvation and eternal life?&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we talk about God as being in three persons, we are not saying that the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit are human beings.

This means that each of them has intellect …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;God in Three Persons&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we talk about God as being in three persons, we are not saying that the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit are human beings. Instead, we use the term "persons" to describe their personhood or personality. This means that each of them has intellect, emotion, and volition. Any being with rationality, emotion, and a will can be considered a person, whether human beings, angelic beings, or the Divine Being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's important to note that the term "person" does not include physicality because human beings continue to exist as persons even after death. While their bodies decay, their true selves, their personhood, continue to exist in either heaven or hell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Distinct Persons of the Trinity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we speak of God existing in three persons, we mean that God's existence is made up of three distinct centers of intellect, emotion, and will. Each person of the Trinity has a unique role in creation and in the salvation of mankind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Father: The Father is one of the persons of the Trinity. He is not the Son or the Holy Spirit. Jesus often prayed to the Father, showing that they are distinct persons (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/23/Luke-23-34.html"&gt;Luke 23:34&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; Consider how Jesus' prayers to the Father demonstrate a relationship between distinct persons within the Trinity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Son: The Son is another person of the Trinity. He is not the Father or the Holy Spirit. Jesus is fully God and fully man and played a unique role in our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; Reflect on how Jesus being fully God and fully man allows Him to bridge the gap between humanity and divinity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VM2UE6MIKzM" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Holy Spirit: The Holy Spirit is also a distinct person of the Trinity. He is not the Father or the Son. The Holy Spirit proceeds from both the Father and the Son and has a unique role in guiding and empowering believers (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/15/John-15-26.html"&gt;John 15:26&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; Consider how the Holy Spirit's role as a guide and empowerer impacts your relationship with God.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Unity of the Trinity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the three persons of the Trinity are distinct, they are united as one God. They share the same nature and essence, and they are all the same God. This unity is crucial for several reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Love: God is love (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-John/4/1-John-4-8.html"&gt;1 John 4:8&lt;/a&gt;). However, before God created any other being, could He have truly been love? Love requires someone to be loved. Because God exists in three co-equal, co-eternal persons, love exists too. The Father, Son, and Spirit have always loved each other, making love eternal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Understanding that God exists in three persons helps us grasp the eternal nature of love within the Trinity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Community: The Trinity provides a model of perfect community and relationship. The Father, Son, and Holy Spirit have eternally existed in perfect harmony, demonstrating the importance of unity and relationship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Seeing the perfect community within the Trinity encourages us to prioritize unity and relationships in our own lives.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Redemption: The distinct roles of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit in salvation highlight the depth of God's love for humanity. Each person played a unique part in our redemption, showcasing God's multifaceted nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Recognizing the distinct roles within the Trinity helps us appreciate the comprehensive work of God in our salvation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, when we talk about God in three persons, we refer to the distinct personhood or personality of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. Each person of the Trinity has intellect, emotion, and volition. While they are distinct from one another, they are united as one God, sharing the same nature and essence. The Trinity provides a model of perfect love, community, and redemption, demonstrating the multifaceted nature of God's character. Understanding the Trinity deepens our understanding of God's eternal love and invites us to prioritize unity and relationships in our own lives.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/The Nature of God/The Trinity"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Discover the Majesty of God's Omnificent Creation: A Christian Reflection</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/god-omnificent/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-08-30T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-08-30T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-08-30:/god-omnificent/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;God's Omnificence: The Power to Create All Things&lt;/h2&gt;

In the Bible, the first verse of Genesis affirms God's omnificence: "In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth."

&lt;p&gt;The concept of omnificence refers to the ability to create all things, possessing unlimited power to bring forth existence. In the Bible, the first verse of Genesis affirms God's omnificence: "In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth." This divine attribute is also emphasized in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Colossians/1/Colossians-1-15.html"&gt;Colossians 1:15&lt;/a&gt;–17, which speaks of Jesus, the second Person of the Trinity, as the image of the invisible God and affirms that all things were created through Him and for Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God's omnificence stems from His omnipotence, which denotes His infinite power. Scripture attests that God is stronger and more powerful than any created being or object. &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Job/37/Job-37-23.html"&gt;Job 37:23&lt;/a&gt; states, "The Almighty is beyond our reach and exalted in power; in his justice and great righteousness, he does not oppress." In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Jeremiah/32/Jeremiah-32-17.html"&gt;Jeremiah 32:17&lt;/a&gt;, it is acknowledged that God made the heavens and the earth by His great power and outstretched arm, with nothing being too hard for Him. Thus, God possesses the power to do all things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another attribute closely related to God's omnificence is His omniscience, which characterizes Him as infinite in knowledge. In the act of creation, God's omniscience worked hand in hand with His omnificence. &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Proverbs/3/Proverbs-3-19.html"&gt;Proverbs 3:19&lt;/a&gt; reveals that by wisdom the Lord laid the earth's foundations and by understanding He set the heavens in place. Being omnificent, having created all things, naturally equips God with comprehensive knowledge. First &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/3/John-3-20.html"&gt;John 3:20&lt;/a&gt; asserts that God is greater than our hearts and knows all things. &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/46/Isaiah-46-10.html"&gt;Isaiah 46:10&lt;/a&gt; further elucidates that God knows the future as well as the past, making known the end from the beginning. Even our thoughts are known to Him before they are formed: "Before a word is on my tongue you, LORD, know it completely" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/139/Psalm-139-4.html"&gt;Psalm 139:4&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bible unveils numerous other attributes of God, many of which find expression in His creative work. &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/1/Romans-1-20.html"&gt;Romans 1:20&lt;/a&gt; affirms that since the creation of the world, God's invisible qualities—His eternal power and divine nature—have been clearly seen and understood through what has been made. Psalm 104 is a psalm replete with praise for our omnificent God. It marvels at the multitude of His works and acknowledges the wisdom displayed in their creation. The psalm extols the creation of light, clouds, wind, seas, mountains, valleys, beasts of the field, birds of the sky, trees, sun and moon, and the very rhythm of life. All these serve as testaments to God's omnificence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NjZPqX5Gdns" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/40/Psalm-40-5.html"&gt;Psalm 40:5&lt;/a&gt; contemplates the depth of God's omnificence and acknowledges that His wonders are too numerous to declare: "Many, LORD my God, are the wonders you have done. . . . None can compare with you; were I to speak and tell of your deeds, they would be too many to declare." God's creative power is limitless and surpasses our ability to fully comprehend. He is our omnificent Creator, Sustainer, and the sole source of eternal life. &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Acts/17/Acts-17-28.html"&gt;Acts 17:28&lt;/a&gt; encapsulates this truth by stating that in Him we live, move, and have our being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding God's omnificence is vital because it reminds us of His unmatched power and authority over all creation. Recognizing that everything around us is a product of His divine creativity deepens our appreciation for His greatness. Moreover, comprehending God's omniscience reveals His intimate knowledge of us and His meticulous involvement in our lives. This understanding fosters a sense of awe and reverence towards our Creator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reflect on the complexity and diversity of creation. How does the reality of God's omnificence impact your perception of His creative work?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consider the implications of God's omniscience for your life. How does knowing that God knows you completely and is involved in every aspect of your existence affect your relationship with Him?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Meditate on the fact that God's power and knowledge are far beyond human comprehension. How does this deepen your trust in Him and His plans for your life?&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Bible teaches that God is omnipresent, which means that He is present everywhere at all times. In Psalm 139, David acknowledges this truth by asking, "Where can I go from your Spirit? Where can I flee from your presence?" He then goes on to describe how …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Presence and Omnipresence&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bible teaches that God is omnipresent, which means that He is present everywhere at all times. In Psalm 139, David acknowledges this truth by asking, "Where can I go from your Spirit? Where can I flee from your presence?" He then goes on to describe how even if he were to ascend to the heavens or descend to the depths of the sea, God would be there. This demonstrates that no matter where we go, God is always with us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Acts 17, the apostle Paul also affirms God's omnipresence when he says, "He is not far from any one of us. 'For in him we live and move and have our being.'" This highlights the fact that God's presence encompasses everything and everyone. Even though we may not always be aware of His presence, He is constantly near us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, there is another sense in which we can either be in or out of God's "presence." In this context, the presence of God refers to His divine blessing and embracing love. The children of God are promised to experience everlasting joy in His presence. As &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/16/Psalm-16-11.html"&gt;Psalm 16:11&lt;/a&gt; states, "You will fill me with joy in your presence, with eternal pleasures at your right hand." This indicates that being in God's presence brings about a sense of joy and fulfillment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, those who reject the gospel will be punished with everlasting destruction and shut out from the presence of the Lord. This separation from God's presence is a consequence of their rejection of Him. It is important to note that this punishment is not merely physical but also spiritual, as it involves being eternally separated from the glory and might of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The presence of God can also refer to a place of honor. Just as it is a privilege to stand in the presence of a king, standing in the presence of God carries great honor and significance. In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/1/Luke-1-19.html"&gt;Luke 1:19&lt;/a&gt;, the angel Gabriel describes himself as one who stands in the presence of God. This indicates that being in the presence of God is a position of honor and authority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the presence of God can also be associated with the demonstration of overwhelming glory and heavenly majesty. When Isaiah had his vision of God on His throne, he described the seraphim as being unable to view God's glory directly. This demonstrates that the presence of God is awe-inspiring and humbling for sinful humanity to approach. It emphasizes the holiness and majesty of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The presence of God can also refer to a unique revelation of Himself to humanity. Throughout history, God has chosen specific locations or events to reveal His presence to His people. For example, Moses encountered God's presence at the burning bush, and later, God revealed Himself at Mount Sinai. These instances highlight how God chooses to manifest His presence in specific ways for the purpose of communicating with His people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to distinguish between God's omnipresence, which is His all-pervading presence, and His manifest presence, which refers to His overt and unmistakable interaction with us. While God is always present everywhere, there are times when He chooses to manifest His presence in a more tangible way so that we can recognize and experience Him more deeply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the concept of God's omnipresence and manifest presence is significant for our relationship with Him. Recognizing that God is always with us brings comfort, assurance, and a sense of security. We can find solace in knowing that we are never alone, even in our most challenging moments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cnVFbQOwdZE" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Knowing that God's presence carries blessings and joy encourages us to seek after Him and cultivate a deeper connection with Him. It reminds us that true fulfillment and happiness are found in His presence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, understanding the honor and awe associated with being in the presence of God helps us approach Him with reverence and respect. It reminds us of His holiness and the need for repentance and humility in His presence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take a moment to reflect on the concept of God's omnipresence. How does knowing that God is always with you impact your daily life?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider the privilege of being in the presence of God. How does this perspective change the way you approach Him in prayer, worship, and obedience?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reflect on the manifestations of God's presence throughout history. How have these instances deepened your understanding of God's character and His desire to communicate with His people?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To understand whether God has free will, we first need to define what we mean by "free will." For the purpose of this discussion, we will define free will as "the capacity of a conscious mind to make decisions and choices without any external constraints or coercion."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on this definition, we can say that God certainly possesses free will. God has a mind, is conscious, and has the capacity to make decisions and choices. He does not answer to any authority, is not limited by any external constraints, and cannot be coerced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God created human beings with a form of free will as well. It is part of what distinguishes us from rocks and animals. However, the volition we possess is of a lesser sort than God's. Unlike humans, God has completely free will in the sense that He is not limited by anything apart from Himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Limited Free Will for Humans&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Human beings have a certain aspect of decision-making that is unconstrained by natural laws. Many events in the world are determined by natural laws, such as objects falling due to gravity or animals following their instincts. However, our choices in matters like what shoes to wear or what breakfast to order are not governed by these natural laws.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While humans have a limited autonomy within the natural world, there are always limitations on our choices. We cannot choose to do things that are physically impossible, like flapping our arms and flying to the moon. Therefore, human beings have a form of free will that is constrained by external factors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;God's Unconstrained Free Will&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast to humans, God's free will is unconstrained in every aspect. The natural world operates subsidiary to His realm. He is not bound by natural laws; in fact, He established those laws and is sovereign over them. God could have created the universe in any number of ways, but the way it exists is due to His choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even the act of creation itself was the result of God's free will. His choice to create was not influenced by any necessity or obligation. God's volition is absolute; His actions are neither deterministically constrained nor controlled by someone else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Fed9hwmJNSE" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;God's Intrinsic Nature and Limitations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While God has complete free will, there are certain things that He is incapable of doing because of His perfect and holy nature. For example, &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Titus/1/Titus-1-2.html"&gt;Titus 1:2&lt;/a&gt; states that God "cannot lie." This limitation does not suggest any external control but rather identifies an intrinsic property of God's own character. God cannot be unfaithful to Himself, break His Word, or be less than perfect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, there are certain things that God is incapable of doing because of the very nature of reality. For instance, He cannot make a triangular square. These statements reflect the fact that God does not deal in absurdities or fallacies but operates within the bounds of reality that He established.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God's inability to lie or sin or engage in illogical actions does not diminish His freedom in any way. Instead, it is a result of His own intrinsic nature. External influences have no hold on Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding whether God has free will has important implications for our understanding of His nature and sovereignty. Recognizing that God possesses free will helps us grasp His absolute authority and control over all things. It highlights the fact that He is not subject to external constraints or limitations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, acknowledging our own limited free will humbles us before God and reminds us of our dependence on Him. It reinforces the truth that we are creatures created by God and subject to His authority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Think About It&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reflect on the concept of free will as defined in this article. How does this definition align with your understanding of free will?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider the limitations on human free will discussed in this article. How do these limitations affect your perspective on the choices you make?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does it mean for God to have complete free will? How does this understanding impact your view of God's sovereignty and authority?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reflect on the idea that God's inability to lie or sin is a result of His perfect and holy nature. How does this reinforce your trust in His character?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can a deeper understanding of God's free will and our limited free will impact how we approach decision-making and submit to God's authority in our lives?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The concept of the Trinity is one of the most profound and mysterious teachings in Christianity. While it may be difficult to fully comprehend, understanding the different roles within the Trinity can provide insight into the nature of God. In this article, we will explore the idea of the "economic Trinity" and how it relates to the unique relationships among the three Persons of the Trinity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What is the Economic Trinity?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The term "economic Trinity" is not found in Scripture, but it is a theological concept that helps us understand the roles and relationships within the Trinity. The word "economic" comes from the Greek word meaning "household management" or "organization." In this context, it refers to the assigning of roles and responsibilities within the family of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The economic Trinity is often discussed in contrast to the "ontological Trinity." While the economic Trinity focuses on the roles and functions of each Person, the ontological Trinity emphasizes their co-equal nature. Both concepts are important in understanding how God can be both united and distinct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Distinctions within the Economic Trinity&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scripture reveals that there are distinctions among the three Persons of the Trinity. Each Person has a unique role in accomplishing God's purposes, particularly in relation to our salvation. For example, our salvation is based on the Father's power and love, the Son's death and resurrection, and the Spirit's work of regeneration and sealing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These different tasks performed by each Person help us grasp the concept of the economic Trinity. They demonstrate that while all three Persons are fully God and share one nature, they also have distinct roles within their divine work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aZiBn5fdDAM" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Voluntary Subordination within the Trinity&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another aspect of the economic Trinity is voluntary subordination. This means that even though all three Persons of the Trinity are ontologically equal, they willingly submit to one another in their roles and relationships. The Father "sent" the Son, the Father and the Son "send" the Spirit, and the Spirit speaks only what He hears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This voluntary subordination within the Trinity does not imply any inferiority or superiority among the Persons. Rather, it reveals the perfect unity and harmony that exists within the Godhead. It is a beautiful picture of love and fellowship, which we are invited to experience through our relationship with God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Perfect Love and Fellowship within the Economic Trinity&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The relationships within the economic Trinity provide a glimpse into the perfect love and fellowship that exist within God Himself. The Father, Son, and Holy Spirit have eternally existed in perfect unity, love, and cooperation. Their relationship is characterized by selfless love, mutual submission, and perfect harmony.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This perfect love and fellowship are what all humanity longs for deep down. We were created to experience this kind of intimate relationship with God. Through His love, God draws us into fellowship with Himself, inviting us to share in the divine life and love that exists within the Trinity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the economic Trinity helps us grasp the incredible depth and complexity of God's nature. It reminds us that God is not an impersonal force or distant deity but a loving community of Persons. This understanding also highlights the importance of relationships in our own lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we recognize the perfect love and fellowship within the Trinity, we are inspired to pursue deeper relationships with one another. We are called to reflect this love and unity in our interactions with others, seeking to build up one another in love and selflessness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider how the concept of the economic Trinity challenges any misconceptions you may have about God's nature. How does it deepen your understanding of who God is?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reflect on the voluntary subordination within the Trinity. How can this help you understand humility and submission in your own life? In what ways can you emulate the selfless love and cooperation displayed within the Trinity?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meditate on the perfect love and fellowship within the Trinity. How does this inspire you to pursue deeper relationships with God and with others? How can you foster a spirit of unity and harmony in your interactions with those around you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we seek to understand the economic Trinity, let us approach this profound mystery with awe and reverence. May it deepen our love for God and our appreciation for the relationships He has called us to cultivate.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/The Nature of God/The Trinity"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Unveiling the Almighty Power: Understanding God's Omnipotence in Christian Faith</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/god-omnipotent/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-08-13T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-08-13T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-08-13:/god-omnipotent/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;God's Omnipotence&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Christianity, one of the attributes ascribed to God is omnipotence, which means having all power. This concept is derived from the combination of the Latin words "omni," meaning "all," and "potens," meaning "power." It follows that if God is infinite and sovereign, then He must also be omnipotent. God has all power over all things at all times and in all ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Creation and Preservation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the clearest demonstrations of God's omnipotence is seen in the act of creation. In the book of Genesis, God spoke into existence everything that exists today. Unlike humans who require tools and materials to create, God simply spoke, and by the power of His word, everything came into being out of nothing. The psalmist affirms this when he says, "By the word of the LORD were the heavens made, their starry host by the breath of his mouth" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/33/Psalm-33-6.html"&gt;Psalm 33:6&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, God's power extends to the preservation of His creation. Every aspect of life on earth is sustained by God's continual provision. He provides us with food, clothing, and shelter, all from renewable resources sustained by His power as the preserver of mankind and animals (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/36/Psalm-36-6.html"&gt;Psalm 36:6&lt;/a&gt;). Even the vast seas are under His control, as He sets their limits so they do not overwhelm us (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Job/38/Job-38-8.html"&gt;Job 38:8-11&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Power Over Governments and Leaders&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God's omnipotence also extends to governments and leaders. He has the ability to restrain or allow them to go their own way according to His plans and purposes. The prophet Daniel acknowledges this when he says, "He changes times and seasons; he deposes kings and raises up others" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Daniel/2/Daniel-2-21.html"&gt;Daniel 2:21&lt;/a&gt;). Even Satan and his demons are subject to God's unlimited power. Satan's attack on Job was limited to certain actions because he was restrained by God's power (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Job/1/Job-1-12.html"&gt;Job 1:12&lt;/a&gt;; 2:6). Jesus Himself reminded Pontius Pilate that the power Pilate had over Him was granted to him by God (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/19/John-19-11.html"&gt;John 19:11&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/I0nXG02tpDw" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Limitations on God's Power&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While God is omnipotent, there are certain things that He cannot do because they are contrary to His holy character. For example, the Bible teaches that God cannot lie (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Numbers/23/Numbers-23-19.html"&gt;Numbers 23:19&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Titus/1/Titus-1-2.html"&gt;Titus 1:2&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/6/Hebrews-6-18.html"&gt;Hebrews 6:18&lt;/a&gt;). Lying goes against His moral perfection. Similarly, although God is all-powerful and hates evil, He allows evil to happen according to His good purpose. He uses certain evil events to accomplish His plans, such as allowing the killing of Jesus Christ for the redemption of mankind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Jesus Christ's Omnipotence&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As God incarnate, Jesus Christ is also omnipotent. His power was evident in the miracles He performed during His earthly ministry. From healing the sick and feeding thousands of people with a few loaves and fishes to calming storms and raising the dead, Jesus displayed His control over life and death (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/6/Mark-6-30.html"&gt;Mark 6:30-44&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/4/Mark-4-37.html"&gt;Mark 4:37-41&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/11/John-11-38.html"&gt;John 11:38-44&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/5/Mark-5-35.html"&gt;Mark 5:35-43&lt;/a&gt;). Ultimately, Jesus came to destroy death itself and bring sinners into a right relationship with God (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-Corinthians/15/1-Corinthians-15-22.html"&gt;1 Corinthians 15:22&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/2/Hebrews-2-14.html"&gt;Hebrews 2:14&lt;/a&gt;). He willingly sacrificed Himself on the cross, even though He had the power to call upon legions of angels for protection (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/26/Matthew-26-53.html"&gt;Matthew 26:53&lt;/a&gt;). Through His death and resurrection, Jesus demonstrated His ultimate power over sin and death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Believers Sharing in God's Power&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The amazing truth is that believers who are united with God through Jesus Christ can share in His power. The apostle Paul recognized this when he said, "Therefore I will boast all the more gladly about my weaknesses, so that Christ’s power may rest on me" (2 Corinthians 12:9b). When we are at our weakest, God's power is most evident in us. He is able to do more than we can ask or imagine by His power at work within us (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Ephesians/3/Ephesians-3-20.html"&gt;Ephesians 3:20&lt;/a&gt;). Despite our sin, it is God's power that keeps us in a state of grace (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/2-Timothy/1/2-Timothy-1-12.html"&gt;2 Timothy 1:12&lt;/a&gt;), and it is His power that keeps us from falling (Jude 24). Throughout eternity, the host of heaven will proclaim God's power (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Revelation/19/Revelation-19-1.html"&gt;Revelation 19:1&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding God's omnipotence is crucial for believers because it reminds us of His sovereignty and control over all things. It reassures us that nothing is beyond God's reach or ability. It encourages us to trust in His power to accomplish His purposes in our lives and in the world. Recognizing God's omnipotence also helps us to surrender our weaknesses and allow Christ's power to work through us, displaying His glory to others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reflect on times when you have seen or experienced God's power in your life. How did it affect your faith and trust in Him?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consider how recognizing God's omnipotence can bring comfort and assurance in difficult circumstances.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In what ways can you allow Christ's power to work through your weaknesses? How might this impact your daily life and relationships?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, God's omnipotence is an essential aspect of His character. He has all power over all things at all times and in all ways. From creation to preservation, from governments to miracles, God's power is evident throughout the Bible. As believers, we have the privilege of sharing in His power through our union with Jesus Christ. Recognizing God's omnipotence strengthens our faith, encourages us to trust in His sovereign control, and empowers us to live for His glory.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/The Nature of God/Attributes"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Discover the Transcendent Nature: God is Spirit Unveiled</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/god-is-spirit/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-08-11T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-08-11T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-08-11:/god-is-spirit/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;God is Spirit&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bible teaches us that "God is spirit" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/4/John-4-24.html"&gt;John 4:24&lt;/a&gt;). This statement was made by Jesus to a woman who had questions about the proper way to worship God. It means that God the Father does not have a human body like we do. While Jesus …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;God is Spirit&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bible teaches us that "God is spirit" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/4/John-4-24.html"&gt;John 4:24&lt;/a&gt;). This statement was made by Jesus to a woman who had questions about the proper way to worship God. It means that God the Father does not have a human body like we do. While Jesus, as the Son of God, came to earth in human form, God the Father did not take on a physical body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to note that when the Bible sometimes speaks of God using terms like "hand," "ear," or "eyes," it is using anthropomorphism—a figurative language technique that describes God in terms humans can better understand. These descriptions should not be taken literally but rather help us comprehend certain aspects of God's character.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saying that God is spirit also means that He is invisible. &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Colossians/1/Colossians-1-15.html"&gt;Colossians 1:15&lt;/a&gt; refers to Him as the "invisible God," and &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-Timothy/1/1-Timothy-1-17.html"&gt;1 Timothy 1:17&lt;/a&gt; praises Him as the "immortal, invisible, the only God." Although God is spirit and invisible, He is a living and personal being. We can have a personal relationship with Him and know Him intimately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Nature of God&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God being spirit is essential for understanding His nature. If God had a physical body, He would be limited by time and space. However, as a spirit, He transcends these limitations and can exist in all places simultaneously. This concept helps us grasp His omnipresence—His ability to be present everywhere at once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EKibbFBmD94" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, God's spiritual nature allows us to understand His infiniteness. Being infinite means that there are no restrictions or boundaries on His existence. If God had a physical body, He would be limited in some way. But as a spirit, He is limitless and unbound by any physical or created constraints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Worshiping in Spirit and Truth&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus connects the fact that God is spirit with the idea of worshiping Him in spirit and truth. Worshiping in spirit means that we engage with God from the depths of our soul, with our heart and mind fully dedicated to Him. It is a worship that goes beyond external rituals and traditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Worshiping in truth means worshiping God accurately—the way He has revealed Himself to us through His Word, the Bible. It involves aligning our beliefs and practices with the truth found in Scripture and not relying solely on our own opinions or preferences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding that God is spirit helps us grasp the nature of our relationship with Him. It reminds us that He is not confined to a physical form, but rather a living and personal being who desires to have a genuine connection with us. Recognizing His invisibility also encourages us to seek Him with faith and trust rather than relying solely on what we can see or understand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recognizing that God is spirit also invites us into a deeper understanding of worship. It challenges us to move beyond outward expressions and rituals and instead approach worship with authenticity, sincerity, and reverence. Worshiping in spirit and truth enables us to cultivate a meaningful relationship with God and experience His presence in our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Think About It&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does the concept of God being spirit impact your understanding of who He is? How does it affect your relationship with Him?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In what ways can you engage in worship that goes beyond external rituals and traditions? How can you deepen your worship experience?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reflect on your understanding of worship in truth. How can you ensure that your beliefs and practices align with the truth revealed in Scripture?&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question of how many gods exist is a complex one that varies depending on different religious beliefs. In this article, we will explore the perspectives of various religions and worldviews, with a focus on the monotheistic view upheld by Christianity, Judaism, and Islam. We will also examine polytheism, atheism, and pantheism to provide a comprehensive understanding of different perspectives on the divine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Monotheism: One God&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monotheistic religions such as Christianity, Judaism, and Islam firmly believe in the existence of only one true God. These religions teach that God is the creator and sustainer of all things and transcends the entire universe. According to the Bible, there is only one God who is eternal, all-powerful, and sovereign over all creation. This monotheistic perspective rejects the idea that any other entities can be considered gods or challenge the power of the one true God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Polytheism: Many Gods&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polytheistic religions allow for the belief in multiple gods. Polytheism takes various forms, with some considering all gods to be relatively equal and others establishing a hierarchy among them. Hinduism, for example, teaches the existence of millions of gods. Other polytheistic belief systems include some forms of Buddhism, Taoism, Shintoism, Paganism, and Mormonism (although Mormons argue that they worship only one God).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Atheism: No Gods&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Atheism is a worldview that rejects the existence of any gods or supernatural beings. Atheists do not believe in a personal divine being who created or governs the universe. From an atheist's perspective, there is no evidence or reason to support the existence of a god or any form of divine power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9sI3F9TV750" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Pantheism: All is God&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pantheism is a worldview that holds that God is present in and permeates all things. Many Hindus, Buddhists, and New Age religions adhere to pantheistic beliefs. According to pantheism, God is infinite and encompasses everything in the world. In this view, everything is associated with God, and there is no distinction between God and the world. Pantheism does not attribute personal characteristics to God, but rather sees God as an all-encompassing force.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Christian Perspective&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christianity upholds a unique perspective on the nature of God. It affirms the existence of one God while revealing that God exists in three co-existent, co-eternal, and co-equal persons known as the Trinity. The Trinity consists of God the Father, God the Son (Jesus Christ), and God the Holy Spirit. This understanding of God's nature sets Christianity apart from other monotheistic religions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding different perspectives on the existence of gods helps us engage with people from diverse religious backgrounds. It allows us to respect their beliefs while also articulating our own faith. Furthermore, exploring these ideas encourages us to deepen our understanding of our own faith and develop a coherent worldview.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider how your own beliefs about God align with the perspectives discussed in this article. Reflect on how understanding different viewpoints can inform your interactions with people of other faiths or worldviews.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/The Nature of God/Singularity"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>7 Proven Benefits of Embracing Monotheism in Christianity</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/monotheism/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-08-07T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-08-07T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-08-07:/monotheism/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Monotheism&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monotheism is the belief in one true God who is the only creator, sustainer, and judge of all creation. It differs from henotheism, which believes in multiple gods with one supreme God over all, and polytheism, which is the belief in the existence of more than one god.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The …&lt;/h3&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Monotheism&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monotheism is the belief in one true God who is the only creator, sustainer, and judge of all creation. It differs from henotheism, which believes in multiple gods with one supreme God over all, and polytheism, which is the belief in the existence of more than one god.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Biblical Basis for Monotheism&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bible provides several verses that support monotheism. In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Deuteronomy/4/Deuteronomy-4-35.html"&gt;Deuteronomy 4:35&lt;/a&gt;, it is stated that "You were shown these things so that you might know that the LORD is God; besides Him there is no other." &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Deuteronomy/6/Deuteronomy-6-4.html"&gt;Deuteronomy 6:4&lt;/a&gt; says, "Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God, the LORD is one." Other verses such as Malachi 2:10a, &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-Corinthians/8/1-Corinthians-8-6.html"&gt;1 Corinthians 8:6&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Ephesians/4/Ephesians-4-6.html"&gt;Ephesians 4:6&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-Timothy/2/1-Timothy-2-5.html"&gt;1 Timothy 2:5&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/James/2/James-2-19.html"&gt;James 2:19&lt;/a&gt; also emphasize the belief in one God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While these biblical references may not be convincing for those who do not believe in the authority of the Bible, they serve as a starting point for those who are familiar with its teachings. Moreover, the supernatural evidence presented in Scripture and the life and resurrection of Jesus Christ can provide additional support for monotheism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Historical Anthropology and Monotheism&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study of historical anthropology reveals an interesting trend in religious development. Contrary to the popular evolutionary theory that suggests religions have evolved from monotheism to polytheism, many cultures actually show vestiges of monotheism early in their development. This suggests that most religions have begun with a belief in one God before devolving into polytheism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8KrWSvZkkQ4" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even within polytheistic religions, there is often a central god who is considered sovereign over the rest. This functional monotheism or henotheism further supports the idea that monotheism is deeply ingrained in human religious beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Philosophical Arguments for Monotheism&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several philosophical arguments that support the belief in one God. One such argument is based on the idea that if there were more than one God, the universe would be in disorder due to multiple creators and authorities. However, since the universe is not in disorder, it follows that there is only one God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another argument stems from the concept of God being a completely perfect being. If there were a second God, they would have to differ in some way, which would mean they are less than perfect and not truly God. Therefore, there can only be one completely perfect being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the infinite existence of God poses a challenge to the existence of multiple gods. If God's existence is infinite and cannot be divided into parts, it follows that there cannot be two infinite beings. Therefore, there can only be one infinite God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding monotheism is important because it forms the foundation of many religious beliefs and practices. It provides a framework for understanding the nature of God and our relationship with Him. Monotheism also highlights the uniqueness and supremacy of God, emphasizing His role as the creator and sustainer of all things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think About It&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider how monotheism shapes your understanding of God and your relationship with Him. How does the belief in one true God impact your daily life and decisions? Reflect on how monotheism sets Christianity apart from other religions that may embrace polytheism or henotheism.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/The Nature of God/Singularity"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Unlocking the Infinite Majesty of God: A Christian's Guide to Understanding His Limitless Nature</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/infinite-god/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-08-04T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-08-04T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-08-04:/infinite-god/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;The Infinite Nature of God&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The infinite nature of God is a fundamental aspect of His being. It refers to the fact that God exists outside of and is not limited by time or space. When we say that God is infinite, we are acknowledging that He is without limits. This concept is often associated with terms like omniscience, omnipotence, and omnipresence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Omniscience: God's Unlimited Knowledge&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One aspect of God's infinite nature is His omniscience, which means that He is all-knowing. God has unlimited knowledge and nothing takes Him by surprise. He knows everything that has happened, is happening, and will happen. Not only does God know all things that will occur in the future, but He also knows all things that could have possibly happened. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think About It: God's infinite knowledge means that He is the sovereign ruler and judge over all things. He sees and understands everything, including our thoughts and intentions. This should remind us to live in reverence and awe of Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Omnipotence: God's Unlimited Power&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God's infinite nature also includes His omnipotence, which means that He is all-powerful. His power is unlimited, and there is nothing that can stop His decreed will from happening. Nothing can thwart or stop His divine purposes from being fulfilled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think About It: God's infinite power gives us confidence in His ability to carry out His sovereign will. We can trust that He is in control and working all things together for the good of those who love Him (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/8/Romans-8-28.html"&gt;Romans 8:28&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Omnipresence: God's Ever-Present Nature&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another aspect of God's infinite nature is His omnipresence, which means that He is always present. There is no place where we can go to escape God's presence. He exists at every point in time and space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think About It: God's infinite presence assures us that we are never alone. He is with us always, guiding us and holding us in His hand. We can find comfort and security in knowing that He is near.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/x7ogV49WGco" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Transcendence: God's Exceeding Greatness&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because God is infinite, He is also said to be transcendent. This means that He is exceedingly far above creation and greater than it. God is independent of His creation, and He surpasses our ability to fully comprehend Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think About It: Our finite minds cannot fully grasp the greatness of God. However, He has revealed Himself to us through creation, our conscience, the Bible, and Jesus Christ. Through His revelation, we can know God and understand His will for our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters: Understanding God's Infinite Nature&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding and embracing the infinite nature of God is vital for our faith and relationship with Him. It reminds us of His sovereignty, power, and presence. It encourages us to trust in His plans and purposes. It also humbles us, acknowledging that we are finite beings in need of a limitless God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It: Our Infinite God&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we reflect on the infinite nature of God, let us marvel at His greatness and embrace His revelation. Let us seek to know Him more deeply and to live in awe of His majesty. May we find comfort and peace in His omnipresence and trust in His unlimited power. And may we live our lives in a way that honors and glorifies our infinite God.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/The Nature of God/Time and Place"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Unveiling the Sacred Mystery of the Ontological Trinity: A Christian Perspective</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/ontological-trinity/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-08-03T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-08-03T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-08-03:/ontological-trinity/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Ontological Trinity: Understanding the Nature of God&lt;/h2&gt;

But …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Ontological Trinity: Understanding the Nature of God&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Christian theology, the concept of the Trinity is a fundamental belief that seeks to explain the nature of God. The term "ontological Trinity," also known as the "immanent Trinity," delves into the being or nature of each member of the Trinity. But what exactly does this mean?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Nature of Being&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To understand the ontological Trinity, we must first grasp the concept of ontology, which is the philosophical study of the nature of being. When we speak of the ontological Trinity, we are referring to the essence and attributes of each Person within the Trinity. In essence, it asserts that all three Persons – the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit – share the same divine nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Equality in Nature&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The teaching of the ontological Trinity emphasizes equality among the three Persons of God. They are equal in power, glory, wisdom, and every other aspect of their divine nature. This means that there is no hierarchy or superiority among them. While they fulfill different roles within creation and salvation (which we'll explore later), they are inherently equal in their divine attributes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Essential Unity&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ontological Trinity is also sometimes referred to as the "essential Trinity." This term highlights the essential unity and shared divine nature among the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. It emphasizes that they are not separate gods or entities but rather distinct Persons within one Godhead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-p0ir65Lhto" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The Economic Trinity&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To fully grasp the concept of the ontological Trinity, it is helpful to contrast it with another theological term: the economic Trinity. While the ontological Trinity focuses on who God is, the economic Trinity centers on what God does. The economic Trinity explores the relationships within the Godhead and each Person's role in creation and salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Biblical Basis&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept of an ontological Trinity finds support in various biblical passages. For instance, &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/10/John-10-30.html"&gt;John 10:30&lt;/a&gt; states that Jesus and the Father are one. This oneness refers to their shared nature, highlighting their ontological unity. Additionally, in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/28/Matthew-28-19.html"&gt;Matthew 28:19&lt;/a&gt;, Jesus instructs us to baptize "in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit." This statement equates the three Persons of the Godhead, affirming their ontological equality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the ontological Trinity is crucial for Christians as it forms the foundation of our belief system. It shapes our understanding of who God is – a triune being with three distinct Persons who are equal in nature. Recognizing this truth helps us develop a deeper appreciation for the complexity and unity of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider how the concept of the ontological Trinity impacts your view of God. How does it shape your understanding of His attributes and relationships within the Godhead? Reflect on how this belief influences your relationship with each Person of the Trinity and your understanding of their roles in creation and salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Symbol for the Trinity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept of the Trinity is complex, and finding a symbol that accurately represents it can be challenging. However, one commonly used symbol is a diagram consisting of three interlocking circles. Each circle represents one Person of the Trinity: the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. The overlapping area symbolizes their essential unity as one Godhead, while the distinct circles represent their individuality as distinct Persons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Trinity Symbol" src="https://example.com/trinity-symbol.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this symbol can help us visualize the Trinity, it is important to remember that no single representation can fully capture the depth and mystery of this theological concept.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ontological Trinity is a fundamental doctrine in Christianity that explores the nature of God. It emphasizes that each Person within the Trinity shares the same divine nature and is equal in power, glory, wisdom, and all other attributes. This concept is essential to our understanding of God's unity and informs our relationship with each Person of the Trinity. As we reflect on the ontological Trinity, let us marvel at the complexity and beauty of our triune God.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/The Nature of God/The Trinity"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>The Immutable Nature of God: Unveiling His Eternal Stability</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/immutability-god/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-08-01T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-08-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-08-01:/immutability-god/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;The Immutability of God&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The immutability of God refers to His quality of not changing. It is a concept clearly taught throughout Scripture. In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Malachi/3/Malachi-3-6.html"&gt;Malachi 3:6&lt;/a&gt;, God affirms, "I the Lord do not change." This sentiment is echoed in other verses such as &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Numbers/23/Numbers-23-19.html"&gt;Numbers 23:19&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-Samuel/15/1-Samuel-15-29.html"&gt;1 Samuel 15 …&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;The Immutability of God&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The immutability of God refers to His quality of not changing. It is a concept clearly taught throughout Scripture. In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Malachi/3/Malachi-3-6.html"&gt;Malachi 3:6&lt;/a&gt;, God affirms, "I the Lord do not change." This sentiment is echoed in other verses such as &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Numbers/23/Numbers-23-19.html"&gt;Numbers 23:19&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-Samuel/15/1-Samuel-15-29.html"&gt;1 Samuel 15:29&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/46/Isaiah-46-9.html"&gt;Isaiah 46:9-11&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Ezekiel/24/Ezekiel-24-14.html"&gt;Ezekiel 24:14&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/James/1/James-1-17.html"&gt;James 1:17&lt;/a&gt; also teaches the immutability of God, stating that every good and perfect gift comes from Him and there is no variableness or shadow of turning in Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To understand the immutability of God, we can think of it in terms of the sun. The sun rises and sets, appears and disappears every day. It moves across the sky and casts its shadow. But with God, who is light itself, there is no darkness at all. There is no change with Him, nor anything like it. He is unchangeable in His nature, perfections, purposes, promises, and gifts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several logical reasons why God must be immutable. First, for change to occur, there must be a chronological order. There must be a point in time before the change and a point in time after the change. However, God exists outside of the constraints of time. He is eternal (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/33/Psalm-33-11.html"&gt;Psalm 33:11&lt;/a&gt;; 41:13; 90:2-4; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/17/John-17-5.html"&gt;John 17:5&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/2-Timothy/1/2-Timothy-1-9.html"&gt;2 Timothy 1:9&lt;/a&gt;), and therefore not subject to the limitations of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, the immutability of God is necessary for His perfection. If anything changes, it must either change for the better or the worse. But since God is perfect, He does not need anything. Therefore, He cannot change for the better or the worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thirdly, the immutability of God is related to His omniscience. When someone changes their mind, it is often because new information has come to light or the circumstances have changed. But God is omniscient and knows all things. He cannot learn something new that He did not already know. So, when the Bible speaks of God changing His mind, it is describing a change in dispensation and outward dealings toward man, not a change in God Himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pvhBX_5z0fw" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Numbers/23/Numbers-23-19.html"&gt;Numbers 23:19&lt;/a&gt; affirms the immutability of God, stating that He is not a man that He should lie or change His mind. This verse emphasizes that God does not change His mind. The doctrine of God's immutability is further affirmed throughout Scripture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the immutability of God is important for our faith and relationship with Him. It assures us that God's character and promises remain constant. We can trust in His unchanging nature and rely on His faithfulness. It also reminds us that God's love and grace are not subject to fluctuation or alteration. His love for us is steadfast and unchanging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The immutability of God also has implications for our own lives. If we serve a God who does not change, we can have confidence in His guidance and direction. We don't have to worry about God changing His mind about us or His plans for our lives. This stability and constancy provide us with security and peace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How does the immutability of God impact your understanding of His character?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In what ways does the concept of an unchanging God bring you comfort and assurance?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How does knowing that God does not change affect your trust in Him and your relationship with Him?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Bible provides us with a clear understanding of what God is like and what He is not like. Without relying on the authority of the Bible, any attempt to explain God's attributes would be no better than an opinion, which is often incorrect when it comes to understanding God. It is crucial for us to try to understand what God is like because failure to do so can lead us to set up false gods and worship them against His will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Self-Revealing Nature of God&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God has chosen to reveal knowledge of Himself through creation, the Bible, and the Word made flesh—Jesus Christ. Creation itself offers a glimpse of God's works and reveals His awesomeness through its vastness, complexity, beauty, and order. By considering these aspects of creation, we can begin to grasp the greatness of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Names of God&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reading through some of the names of God can also help us understand what He is like. Here are a few examples:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Elohim - This name refers to God as the strong One, divine.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adonai - It signifies a Lord who establishes a Master-to-servant relationship.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;El Elyon - This name emphasizes that God is the Most High, the strongest One.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;El Roi - It means that God is the strong One who sees everything.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;El Shaddai - This name highlights that God is Almighty.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;El Olam - It signifies that God is the Everlasting God.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yahweh - This name means "I AM" and represents the eternal, self-existent nature of God.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Attributes of God&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eternal and Immutable&lt;/strong&gt;: God is eternal, meaning He had no beginning and will never cease to exist. He is immortal and infinite. Furthermore, God is unchanging (immutable), making Him absolutely reliable and trustworthy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Incomparable and Perfect&lt;/strong&gt;: God is unparalleled in His works and being. He is unequaled and perfect. There is no one like Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inscrutable and Omniscient&lt;/strong&gt;: God is inscrutable, unfathomable, unsearchable, and beyond complete understanding. However, He is omniscient, meaning He knows everything—the past, present, and future—along with our thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Just and Omnipotent&lt;/strong&gt;: God is just and does not show favoritism. He is also omnipotent, possessing all power. However, His actions are always in line with His character.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Omnipresent and Sovereign&lt;/strong&gt;: God is omnipresent, meaning He is present everywhere. Yet, this does not mean that God is everything. Additionally, God is sovereign—supreme over all creation, with all of His purposes prevailing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YfeZSRnQnI8" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spirit and Truth&lt;/strong&gt;: God is spirit, invisible to human eyes. He cannot be seen with physical senses but can be experienced through faith. Moreover, God is truth itself; He cannot lie or be corrupt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Holy and Gracious&lt;/strong&gt;: God is holy, separate from all moral defilement and hostile toward evil. He sees all wrongdoings and hates them. However, He is also gracious and extends His goodness, kindness, mercy, and love to us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One and Righteous&lt;/strong&gt;: God is one; there is no other like Him who can meet the deepest needs of our hearts. He alone deserves our worship and devotion. Furthermore, God is righteous—He cannot overlook wrongdoing, which required Jesus to experience God's wrath for our sins to be forgiven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the attributes of God is crucial for our faith. It helps us develop a proper understanding of who God is and how we should relate to Him. Knowing that God is eternal, immutable, and omnipotent gives us confidence in His promises and trustworthiness. Recognizing God's justice and righteousness reminds us of the seriousness of sin and the need for forgiveness through Jesus Christ. Understanding God's holiness and grace helps us appreciate His love and mercy towards us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reflecting on the attributes of God can lead us to a deeper appreciation of His character and nature. Consider the following questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does knowing that God is eternal and unchanging impact your trust in Him?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In what ways does understanding God's justice and righteousness affect your view of sin and the need for forgiveness?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does recognizing God's holiness and grace influence your understanding of His love for you?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By pondering these questions, we can deepen our relationship with God and grow in our understanding of His attributes.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/The Nature of God/The Basics"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Discover the Unwavering Presence of God: A Guide for Christian Believers</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/god-omnipresent/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-07-30T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-07-30T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-07-30:/god-omnipresent/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;God's Omnipresence&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The concept of God's omnipresence is rooted in Latin, with the prefix "omni" meaning "all." When we say that God is omnipresent, we mean that God is present everywhere. In Christianity and Judaism, the belief in God's omnipresence is further divided into transcendence and immanence. Transcendence refers to the idea that God is not fully immersed in the fabric of creation (pantheism), but rather exists beyond it. Immanence, on the other hand, emphasizes that God is present everywhere at all times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Understanding God's omnipresence helps us develop a deeper appreciation for His immeasurable power and influence. It reminds us that we are never alone and that God is always with us, regardless of our circumstances. Recognizing His presence can provide comfort, guidance, and assurance in our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; Reflect on moments when you have felt God's presence in your life. How did it affect you? How can remembering His omnipresence impact your daily life and relationship with Him?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Continuous Presence&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God's presence is continuous throughout all of creation, although it may not be revealed in the same way at the same time to everyone. Sometimes, He may actively manifest His presence in a situation, while in other circumstances, He may not reveal Himself. The Bible teaches that God can be both manifestly present to individuals (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/46/Psalm-46-1.html"&gt;Psalm 46:1&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/57/Isaiah-57-15.html"&gt;Isaiah 57:15&lt;/a&gt;) and present in every situation within creation at any given time (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/33/Psalm-33-13.html"&gt;Psalm 33:13-14&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; Consider moments when you have recognized God's manifest presence in your life or the lives of others. How did it impact your faith or understanding of Him? Reflect on how His continuous presence in all of creation can bring hope and encouragement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Omnipresence in Time and Space&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VEfRuQpInJE" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;God's omnipresence means that He is present in all ranges of both time and space. He is not limited by any specific location or moment. God is everywhere, encompassing every now. No particle is too small for His presence, and no galaxy is too vast for Him to encompass. Even if we were to remove creation, God would still be aware of it, as He knows all possibilities, whether actualized or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Understanding God's omnipresence in time and space highlights His sovereignty and power over the universe. It reminds us that there is nowhere we can go where God is not already present, and that He is intimately aware of every aspect of our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; Reflect on how knowing that God is present in every moment and place can bring a sense of peace and security. How does this truth impact your perspective on life's challenges and uncertainties?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;God's Presence in Creation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God is naturally present in every aspect of the natural world, at all times and in all places (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/40/Isaiah-40-12.html"&gt;Isaiah 40:12&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Nahum/1/Nahum-1-3.html"&gt;Nahum 1:3&lt;/a&gt;). He is actively present in every event throughout history, guiding human affairs (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/48/Psalm-48-7.html"&gt;Psalm 48:7&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/2-Chronicles/20/2-Chronicles-20-37.html"&gt;2 Chronicles 20:37&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Daniel/5/Daniel-5-5.html"&gt;Daniel 5:5-6&lt;/a&gt;). Additionally, God is specially attentive to those who call upon His name, intercede for others, adore Him, petition Him, and earnestly seek forgiveness (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/46/Psalm-46-1.html"&gt;Psalm 46:1&lt;/a&gt;). His presence is supremely manifested in His Son, Jesus Christ (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Colossians/2/Colossians-2-19.html"&gt;Colossians 2:19&lt;/a&gt;), and mystically present in the universal Church that spans the earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Recognizing God's presence in creation helps us understand that He is actively involved in our lives and has a plan for each one of us. It also encourages us to seek a deeper relationship with Him through prayer, worship, and fellowship with other believers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; Consider how you can cultivate a greater awareness of God's presence in your daily life. How can you actively seek His guidance and depend on His strength in every situation?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Paradox of God's Presence&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as the concept of God's omniscience presents paradoxes due to our limited human understanding, so does the notion of His omnipresence. One significant paradox is the presence of God in hell, the place where the wicked are said to suffer the eternal fury of God due to their sin. Some argue that hell is a place of separation from God (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/25/Matthew-25-41.html"&gt;Matthew 25:41&lt;/a&gt;), which would suggest that God cannot be present in a place separated from Him. However, &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Revelation/14/Revelation-14-10.html"&gt;Revelation 14:10&lt;/a&gt; speaks of the torment of the wicked in the presence of the Lamb. This paradox can be explained by recognizing that God can be present even in those places separated from His blessings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; Reflect on the tension between God's presence in both heaven and hell. How does this paradox challenge your understanding of His character? Consider how it deepens your appreciation for His justice and mercy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Returning to God&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While God is present everywhere, sin can create a separation between us and Him (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/52/Isaiah-52-9.html"&gt;Isaiah 52:9&lt;/a&gt;). He is far from the wicked (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Proverbs/15/Proverbs-15-29.html"&gt;Proverbs 15:29&lt;/a&gt;) and has ordained that the godless will depart to a place of eternal punishment. Yet, even in these instances, God remains present. He knows the suffering experienced by those in hell, their anguish, cries for respite, tears, and grief over their eternal state. His perpetual presence serves as a constant reminder of their sin and the chasm it creates between them and every possible blessing. However, through repentance and faith, we can return to God without having to physically move (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/57/Isaiah-57-16.html"&gt;Isaiah 57:16&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Recognizing that God is present even in times of separation and punishment reveals His love for us and His desire for reconciliation. It reminds us that no matter how far we may have strayed, we can always turn to Him and find forgiveness and restoration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; Consider the incredible grace of God that allows us to return to Him despite our sinfulness. How does this truth impact your view of yourself and others? How does it encourage you to extend grace and forgiveness to those around you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, the concept of God's omnipresence teaches us that He is present everywhere at all times. His presence is continuous throughout creation, yet He can manifest Himself in different ways to different people. God's omnipresence extends to all ranges of time and space, emphasizing His sovereignty over the universe. He is present in nature, history, and the lives of individuals, manifesting His love, guidance, and power. Even in places of separation or punishment, God's presence remains, reminding us of His justice and mercy. Understanding God's omnipresence can deepen our faith, provide comfort in difficult times, and inspire us to seek a closer relationship with Him.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/The Nature of God/Time and Place"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>The Divine Immanence: Understanding God's Presence in Christianity</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/immanence-of-god/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-07-30T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-07-30T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-07-30:/immanence-of-god/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;The Immanence of God&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The concept of the immanence of God refers to His presence within His creation. It is the belief that God is present in all aspects of His creation while remaining distinct from it. This should not be confused with the timing of Jesus' return to earth. The immanence of God emphasizes that there is no place where God is not present. He exercises His sovereign control over all things simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Understanding Immanence&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To better understand the immanence of God, it is important to differentiate it from other belief systems that may distort our understanding. Pantheism, for example, teaches that everything is God or a part of God. In this view, God is considered equal to His creation and unable to act upon it. Deism, on the other hand, acknowledges that God is distinct from His creation but denies His active involvement in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wL8VCCLeNvU" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Contrary to these false views, the Bible teaches that God is both different from His creation and actively upholds it. The attributes of transcendence and immanence are both ascribed to God. &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Jeremiah/23/Jeremiah-23-23.html"&gt;Jeremiah 23:23&lt;/a&gt; tells us that He is both "nearby" and "far away." &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/55/Isaiah-55-9.html"&gt;Isaiah 55:9&lt;/a&gt; states, "As the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts." This highlights God's transcendence. Additionally, &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Colossians/1/Colossians-1-17.html"&gt;Colossians 1:17&lt;/a&gt; declares that "in him all things hold together," illustrating His immanence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;God's Omnipresence&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept of God's omnipresence closely relates to His immanence. &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/139/Psalm-139-1.html"&gt;Psalm 139:1-10&lt;/a&gt; beautifully describes this attribute in detail. In the New Testament, Paul affirms that God Himself gives life and breath to all and that in Him we live, move, and have our being (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Acts/17/Acts-17-25.html"&gt;Acts 17:25&lt;/a&gt;, 28). These verses emphasize how God guides, governs, and provides for His creation while remaining above it (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Ephesians/1/Ephesians-1-11.html"&gt;Ephesians 1:11&lt;/a&gt;; 4:6).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Immanence of God in Scripture&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bible as a whole supports the idea of God's immanence. The very existence of God's Word in written form testifies to His interest and action in the world. The survival of Israel throughout biblical history and the Incarnation of Jesus are powerful examples of God's presence and involvement. &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/1/Hebrews-1-3.html"&gt;Hebrews 1:3&lt;/a&gt; affirms that God is "sustaining all things by His powerful word." Furthermore, Jesus is referred to as Immanuel, which means "God with us." This title highlights the immanence of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the immanence of God has significant implications for our faith and relationship with Him. It reminds us that God is not distant or detached from His creation but actively involved in every aspect of our lives. This understanding can bring comfort, knowing that we are never alone, and that God is intimately aware of our needs and circumstances. It also calls us to recognize and appreciate the presence of God in everyday life, leading us to worship and depend on Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reflecting on the immanence of God encourages us to consider our perspective of Him. Do we view Him as a distant deity or as an intimately involved Creator? How does our understanding of God's immanence impact our daily lives? How can we cultivate a greater awareness of His presence and seek to align ourselves with His will? Taking time to ponder these questions can deepen our faith and transform our relationship with God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, the immanence of God emphasizes His presence within His creation while remaining distinct from it. It is a concept supported by Scripture and highlights both God's transcendence and immanence. Understanding God's immanence has practical implications for our faith and calls us to recognize and appreciate His continuous presence in our lives.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/The Nature of God/Time and Place"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Discovering the Divine: Unveiling the Nature of God in Christianity</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/nature-of-god/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-07-30T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-07-30T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-07-30:/nature-of-god/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;The Nature of God&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;God's Holiness&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most important aspects of God's nature is His holiness. Holiness means being set apart, and God is clearly separate from His creation based on His nature and attributes. In the Bible, &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Revelation/15/Revelation-15-4.html"&gt;Revelation 15:4&lt;/a&gt; says, "You alone are holy," and &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Revelation/4/Revelation-4-8.html"&gt;Revelation …&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;The Nature of God&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;God's Holiness&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most important aspects of God's nature is His holiness. Holiness means being set apart, and God is clearly separate from His creation based on His nature and attributes. In the Bible, &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Revelation/15/Revelation-15-4.html"&gt;Revelation 15:4&lt;/a&gt; says, "You alone are holy," and &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Revelation/4/Revelation-4-8.html"&gt;Revelation 4:8&lt;/a&gt; describes the four living creatures singing to God day and night, "Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God Almighty." God's holiness makes Him a "consuming fire" that will judge all sin (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/12/Hebrews-12-29.html"&gt;Hebrews 12:29&lt;/a&gt;). Throughout Scripture, there are beautiful doxologies that exalt God's holiness, such as &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/99/Psalm-99-9.html"&gt;Psalm 99:9&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/33/Psalm-33-21.html"&gt;Psalm 33:21&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/77/Psalm-77-13.html"&gt;Psalm 77:13&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/89/Psalm-89-18.html"&gt;Psalm 89:18&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/105/Psalm-105-3.html"&gt;Psalm 105:3&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Understanding God's holiness helps us recognize His uniqueness and separateness from the world. It reminds us that we should approach Him with reverence and awe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; How does recognizing God's holiness impact your worship and relationship with Him?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Trinity&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God is an eternal spirit who has always existed in three distinct persons: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. He is one God (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Deuteronomy/6/Deuteronomy-6-4.html"&gt;Deuteronomy 6:4&lt;/a&gt;) but exists as three Persons. While God does not have a physical body, the Son became incarnate in Jesus Christ. Denying the Trinity or viewing God the Father as a man is a false doctrine. It is essential to affirm both the humanity and deity of Christ (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/2-John/1/2-John-1-7.html"&gt;2 John 1:7&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Understanding the Trinity teaches us about the complexity and unity within the nature of God. It also helps us understand how each person of the Trinity plays a unique role in our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; How does recognizing the Trinity affect your understanding of salvation?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;God's Sovereignty&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God, by nature, is sovereign. He has absolute authority over the entire universe and everything in it. His sovereignty is expressed in many ways, including His omnipotence. All of God's ways are right (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/145/Psalm-145-17.html"&gt;Psalm 145:17&lt;/a&gt;), and He is not constrained by time or place. He has a plan that has been in place from eternity past, and His purpose will be accomplished (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Daniel/4/Daniel-4-37.html"&gt;Daniel 4:37&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/115/Psalm-115-3.html"&gt;Psalm 115:3&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QPywCD-TSd0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Recognizing God's sovereignty helps us trust in His plans and purposes even when we don't understand them. It reminds us that God is ultimately in control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; How does understanding God's sovereignty impact your faith and trust in Him?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;God's Immutability&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God does not change; He is the same "yesterday, today, and forever" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/13/Hebrews-13-8.html"&gt;Hebrews 13:8&lt;/a&gt;). He explicitly states in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Malachi/3/Malachi-3-6.html"&gt;Malachi 3:6&lt;/a&gt;, "I the LORD do not change." Because of His unchanging nature, we can depend on His blessings. &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/James/1/James-1-17.html"&gt;James 1:17&lt;/a&gt; says, "Every good and perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of the heavenly lights, who does not change like shifting shadows."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Understanding God's immutability reassures us that His character and promises remain steadfast. We can rely on Him to be consistent in His love, mercy, and faithfulness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; How does knowing that God does not change impact your relationship with Him?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;God's Omniscience&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God knows everything from eternity past to eternity future. He knows everything we think, do, and say. He has personal knowledge of every person who has ever lived or will live, knowing them intimately in every way. &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Jeremiah/1/Jeremiah-1-5.html"&gt;Jeremiah 1:5&lt;/a&gt; says, "Before I formed you in the womb I knew you, before you were born, I set you apart."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Recognizing God's omniscience brings comfort and assurance. It reminds us that we are known and loved by a God who understands us completely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; How does the knowledge that God knows everything impact your prayer life and sense of security?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;God's Love and Wrath&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God's nature encompasses both love and wrath. He has a righteous anger against sin (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/7/Psalm-7-11.html"&gt;Psalm 7:11&lt;/a&gt;). However, out of His love for the world, He sent His only Son, Jesus Christ, to redeem us (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/3/John-3-16.html"&gt;John 3:16&lt;/a&gt;). God is not only loving but is love itself (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-John/4/1-John-4-16.html"&gt;1 John 4:16&lt;/a&gt;). His love is eternal, unchanging, perfect, and holy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Understanding God's love and wrath helps us grasp the depth of His character and the significance of our salvation through Jesus Christ. It also highlights the importance of sharing the gospel message with others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; How does knowing God's love and wrath impact your understanding of salvation and your relationship with others?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nature of God is multifaceted and complex. He is holy, separate from His creation. He exists as three distinct persons in the Trinity while being one God. God is sovereign, immutable, omniscient, loving, and just. Understanding these aspects of God's nature deepens our faith, shapes our worship, and strengthens our relationship with Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Our understanding of God's nature shapes our theology and informs how we live out our faith daily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The existence of God is evident in both creation and the human conscience, as stated in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/14/Psalm-14-1.html"&gt;Psalm 14:1&lt;/a&gt;. Therefore, the Bible does not attempt to prove God's existence but assumes it from the beginning (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/1/Genesis-1-1.html"&gt;Genesis 1:1&lt;/a&gt;). Instead, the Bible reveals God's nature, character, and …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Who is God?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The existence of God is evident in both creation and the human conscience, as stated in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/14/Psalm-14-1.html"&gt;Psalm 14:1&lt;/a&gt;. Therefore, the Bible does not attempt to prove God's existence but assumes it from the beginning (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/1/Genesis-1-1.html"&gt;Genesis 1:1&lt;/a&gt;). Instead, the Bible reveals God's nature, character, and work. It is crucial to have a correct understanding of God because false ideas about Him lead to idolatry. In simple terms, God can be defined as the Supreme Being, the Creator and Ruler of all things, and the Self-existent One who is perfect in power, goodness, and wisdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Characteristics of God&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;God's Spiritual Nature&lt;/strong&gt;: God is a spirit and cannot be physically perceived (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/4/John-4-24.html"&gt;John 4:24&lt;/a&gt;). This means that He does not have a physical body like humans do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Trinity&lt;/strong&gt;: While God is One, He exists as three distinct Persons - God the Father, God the Son (Jesus Christ), and God the Holy Spirit (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/3/Matthew-3-16.html"&gt;Matthew 3:16-17&lt;/a&gt;). This concept is difficult to fully comprehend but can be understood through an analogy of water existing in three forms: solid (ice), liquid (water), and gas (steam). Although different forms, they are all H2O.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;God's Attributes&lt;/strong&gt;: God possesses various attributes that define His nature. Some of these include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Infinite&lt;/strong&gt;: God has no limits or boundaries (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-Timothy/1/1-Timothy-1-17.html"&gt;1 Timothy 1:17&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Incomparable&lt;/strong&gt;: There is no one like God (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/2-Samuel/7/2-Samuel-7-22.html"&gt;2 Samuel 7:22&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unchanging&lt;/strong&gt;: God remains the same throughout time (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Malachi/3/Malachi-3-6.html"&gt;Malachi 3:6&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Omnipresent&lt;/strong&gt;: God exists everywhere simultaneously (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/139/Psalm-139-7.html"&gt;Psalm 139:7-12&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Omniscient&lt;/strong&gt;: God knows everything (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/147/Psalm-147-5.html"&gt;Psalm 147:5&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/40/Isaiah-40-28.html"&gt;Isaiah 40:28&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All-powerful&lt;/strong&gt;: God has all power and authority (Ephesians 1; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Revelation/19/Revelation-19-6.html"&gt;Revelation 19:6&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_ie9musGEqQ" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;God's Moral Attributes&lt;/strong&gt;: God is just, loving, truthful, and holy. He shows compassion, mercy, and grace. He judges sin but also offers forgiveness (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Acts/17/Acts-17-31.html"&gt;Acts 17:31&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Ephesians/2/Ephesians-2-4.html"&gt;Ephesians 2:4-5&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/14/John-14-6.html"&gt;John 14:6&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-John/1/1-John-1-5.html"&gt;1 John 1:5&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/2-Corinthians/1/2-Corinthians-1-3.html"&gt;2 Corinthians 1:3&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/9/Romans-9-15.html"&gt;Romans 9:15&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/5/Romans-5-17.html"&gt;Romans 5:17&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/5/Psalm-5-5.html"&gt;Psalm 5:5&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/130/Psalm-130-4.html"&gt;Psalm 130:4&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Understanding God through His Works&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To understand God fully, we must examine His works because what God does flows from who He is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Creation&lt;/strong&gt;: God is the Creator of the world (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/1/Genesis-1-1.html"&gt;Genesis 1:1&lt;/a&gt;) and everything in it. He brought the universe into existence out of nothing. The complexity and beauty of creation point to God's intelligence and creativity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sustenance&lt;/strong&gt;: God actively sustains the world by upholding its existence (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Colossians/1/Colossians-1-17.html"&gt;Colossians 1:17&lt;/a&gt;). Every breath we take and every moment we live is a result of God's sustaining power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Redemption&lt;/strong&gt;: God has an eternal plan that involves redeeming humanity from the curse of sin and death (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Ephesians/1/Ephesians-1-11.html"&gt;Ephesians 1:11&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Galatians/3/Galatians-3-13.html"&gt;Galatians 3:13-14&lt;/a&gt;). This plan centers around Jesus Christ, who became incarnate as the Son of Man to bridge the gap between God and humanity (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/1/John-1-14.html"&gt;John 1:14&lt;/a&gt;). Through Jesus, we can have forgiveness of sins, reconciliation with God, and eternal salvation (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Ephesians/1/Ephesians-1-7.html"&gt;Ephesians 1:7&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/15/John-15-15.html"&gt;John 15:15&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/5/Romans-5-10.html"&gt;Romans 5:10&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/2-Timothy/2/2-Timothy-2-10.html"&gt;2 Timothy 2:10&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Divine Intervention&lt;/strong&gt;: God is actively involved in our lives. He draws people to Jesus (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/6/John-6-44.html"&gt;John 6:44&lt;/a&gt;), disciplines His children (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/12/Hebrews-12-6.html"&gt;Hebrews 12:6&lt;/a&gt;), and will judge the world in the future (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Revelation/20/Revelation-20-11.html"&gt;Revelation 20:11-15&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding who God is and His nature is essential for our faith and relationship with Him. It helps us avoid idolatry and worshiping false gods. Knowing that God is just, loving, merciful, and gracious gives us confidence in His character. Recognizing His power and authority helps us trust that He is in control of all things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does knowing that God is present everywhere and knows everything impact your daily life?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does understanding God's attributes affect your perspective on difficult situations?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In what ways can you apply the knowledge of God's character and works to your relationship with Him?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, God is the Supreme Being, the Creator and Ruler of all things, who reveals Himself through creation, conscience, and His Word. He possesses various attributes that define His nature, including being infinite, incomparable, unchanging, omnipresent, omniscient, and all-powerful. God's moral attributes include justice, love, truthfulness, holiness, compassion, mercy, grace, judgment of sin, and forgiveness. Understanding God's works, such as creation, sustenance, redemption through Jesus Christ, and divine intervention, helps us grasp the depth of His love and involvement in our lives. Knowing who God is deepens our faith and relationship with Him.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/The Nature of God/The Basics"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Unlocking the Depths of Theology Proper: A Christian's Essential Guide</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/theology-proper/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-07-13T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-07-13T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-07-13:/theology-proper/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Theology Proper: Understanding God and His Attributes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Theology proper is the study of God and His attributes. It focuses on understanding God the Father and delves into questions such as the existence of God, His attributes, and the nature of the Trinity. In this article, we will explore theology proper in a simplified manner while maintaining a biblical perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Does God Exist?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The very fact that some people aggressively try to disprove God's existence is actually an argument for His existence. The truth is, everyone ultimately knows that God exists. The evidence for God's existence is all around us, from the complexity of creation to the innate sense of morality within us. The study of theology proper affirms this truth and deepens our understanding of God's existence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Understanding God's Attributes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God possesses numerous attributes that define His nature. Some of these attributes include being immortal, invisible, all-wise, blessed, glorious, ancient, almighty, and victorious. These attributes are beautifully expressed in a hymn: "Immortal, invisible, God only wise...most blessed, most glorious, the Ancient of Days, Almighty, Victorious, thy great name we praise." Recognizing and understanding these attributes help us glorify and praise Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Mystery of the Trinity&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Trinity is one of the central doctrines in Christianity. While we can grasp some facts about the relationship between the different persons of the Trinity, it ultimately remains incomprehensible to our human minds. However, just because our finite minds struggle to fully comprehend it doesn't mean it is untrue or not based on biblical teachings. Theology proper acknowledges this mystery and encourages us to embrace and worship the triune God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Sovereignty vs. Free Will&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question of whether God is sovereign or if we have free will often arises when discussing matters of salvation. While our free will may come into play in certain areas of life (such as choosing what to eat for dinner), the focus in theology proper is primarily on our eternal destiny. The study of God's sovereignty and our free will in relation to salvation helps us understand that it is through God's grace that we are saved, and yet we are still responsible for making a choice to accept or reject His gift of salvation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Exploring God's Attributes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Theology proper delves into various attributes of God, including His omnipresence, omniscience, omnipotence, and eternality. These attributes help us understand who God is and what He does. For example, God's omnipresence means that He is present everywhere at all times. His omniscience means that He knows everything, past, present, and future. His omnipotence means that He is all-powerful and capable of doing anything. And His eternality means that He exists outside the constraints of time. Understanding these attributes helps us develop a deeper relationship with God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Correcting Misconceptions About God&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many people have misconceptions about God that affect how they relate to Him. Some view Him as a brutal tyrant with no love or grace, while others see Him solely as a loving friend with no justice or anger. Both of these perceptions are incorrect. Theology proper guides us in understanding that God is both full of mercy, love, and grace, as well as righteous, holy, and just. He grants mercy and executes judgment. He punishes sin and forgives sin. The study of theology proper helps us gain a more accurate understanding of who God truly is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study of theology proper matters because it helps us develop a deeper understanding of God's nature and character. It enables us to worship and relate to Him in a more meaningful way. By gaining knowledge about His attributes, we can grow in our appreciation for who He is and how He works in our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Think About It&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take a moment to reflect on your own understanding of God. How do you perceive His attributes? Are there any misconceptions you may have about Him? Consider how studying theology proper can help you develop a more accurate and comprehensive understanding of God.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/The Nature of God/The Basics"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Unveiling the Divine Mystery: Understanding the Trinity in Christian Faith</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/what-is-the-trinity/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-07-05T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-07-05T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-07-05:/what-is-the-trinity/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;What is the Trinity?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The term "Trinity" is used to describe the triunity or three-ness of God. While the word itself is not found in the Bible, it is a helpful term to describe the unity and plurality of the persons of God. From the very beginning of the Bible, there is evidence of plurality within God. For example, the Hebrew word used for God, Elohim, is in the plural form in Genesis 1 and throughout much of the Old Testament. Additionally, God is distinguished from the Spirit of God (Ruach Elohim) in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/1/Genesis-1-1.html"&gt;Genesis 1:1-2&lt;/a&gt;, and the Lord God (Yahweh Elohim) is identified as the Creator in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/2/Genesis-2-4.html"&gt;Genesis 2:4&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout biblical history, the Lord God (Yahweh) interacts with humanity in various forms. This interaction often occurs through what is referred to as "the angel of the Lord," who is sometimes even referred to as "a man." These early references illustrate that there are three distinct persons who are one in essence and equality: God, the Spirit of God, and the Representative of God to humanity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to note that while there have been alternative explanations for the plurality attributed to God, such as suggesting three separate gods or viewing the trinity as three modes of one person, these views are not compatible with what the Bible teaches. The Bible consistently presents a plurality and singularity within God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God directly asserts His triunity in Isaiah 48. In this passage, the One who named Israel refers to Himself as "the first and the last," identifies Himself as Yahweh, and claims to be the Creator. He also mentions being sent by His Father and empowered by His Spirit. All these attributes are applied to Jesus in the New Testament. Jesus is identified as Yahweh who interacted with Abraham, born to be the King of Israel, referred to as "the first and the last," and recognized as the Creator. He was sent by His Father and empowered by the Spirit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The triunity of God as one God and three persons, known as the Trinity, is a central biblical teaching and a central point of Jesus' own teachings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the concept of the Trinity is essential to grasping the nature of God as revealed in the Bible. It helps us comprehend the unity and plurality of God, and how God interacts with humanity. The Trinity highlights the divine nature of Jesus Christ and His role as the Savior. It also deepens our understanding of the Holy Spirit's work in our lives. Recognizing and accepting the Trinity allows us to have a more complete understanding of God's character and His plan for salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The concept of the Trinity is one of the most challenging aspects of Christianity to fully comprehend. It is a concept that is beyond human understanding, as God is infinitely greater than we are. While we may not be able to fully grasp the intricacies of the Trinity, it is important to recognize that it is based on the teachings of the Bible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One God, Three Persons&lt;/strong&gt;: The Bible teaches that there is only one God (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Deuteronomy/6/Deuteronomy-6-4.html"&gt;Deuteronomy 6:4&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-Corinthians/8/1-Corinthians-8-4.html"&gt;1 Corinthians 8:4&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Galatians/3/Galatians-3-20.html"&gt;Galatians 3:20&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-Timothy/2/1-Timothy-2-5.html"&gt;1 Timothy 2:5&lt;/a&gt;), but it also reveals that God exists in three distinct Persons - the Father, the Son (Jesus), and the Holy Spirit (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/1/Genesis-1-1.html"&gt;Genesis 1:1&lt;/a&gt;, 26; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/3/Matthew-3-16.html"&gt;Matthew 3:16-17&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/2-Corinthians/13/2-Corinthians-13-14.html"&gt;2 Corinthians 13:14&lt;/a&gt;). The term "Trinity" is not found in Scripture, but it is used to describe this triune nature of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Plurality within God&lt;/strong&gt;: In several instances throughout the Bible, there is an indication of plurality within God. For example, in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/1/Genesis-1-26.html"&gt;Genesis 1:26&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/6/Isaiah-6-8.html"&gt;Isaiah 6:8&lt;/a&gt;, God uses plural pronouns like "us" and "our" when referring to Himself. This plurality suggests that God consists of more than one Person. Additionally, the Hebrew word for "God," "Elohim," allows for a plural interpretation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Distinct Persons&lt;/strong&gt;: The members of the Trinity are distinguishable from one another. In passages like &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/110/Psalm-110-1.html"&gt;Psalm 110:1&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/45/Psalm-45-6.html"&gt;Psalm 45:6-7&lt;/a&gt;, the LORD (God the Father) is distinguished from the Lord (God the Son). The Holy Spirit is also distinguished from both the Father and Jesus in various passages (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Numbers/27/Numbers-27-18.html"&gt;Numbers 27:18&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/51/Psalm-51-10.html"&gt;Psalm 51:10-12&lt;/a&gt;). These distinctions demonstrate that each Person of the Trinity has a unique role.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6_LAZZCm_Ko" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deity of Each Person&lt;/strong&gt;: The Bible affirms that each member of the Trinity is fully God. The Father is referred to as God (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/6/John-6-27.html"&gt;John 6:27&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/1/Romans-1-7.html"&gt;Romans 1:7&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-Peter/1/1-Peter-1-2.html"&gt;1 Peter 1:2&lt;/a&gt;), Jesus is identified as God (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/1/John-1-1.html"&gt;John 1:1&lt;/a&gt;, 14; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Colossians/2/Colossians-2-9.html"&gt;Colossians 2:9&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/1/Hebrews-1-8.html"&gt;Hebrews 1:8&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-John/5/1-John-5-20.html"&gt;1 John 5:20&lt;/a&gt;), and the Holy Spirit is described as God (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Acts/5/Acts-5-3.html"&gt;Acts 5:3-4&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-Corinthians/3/1-Corinthians-3-16.html"&gt;1 Corinthians 3:16&lt;/a&gt;). This emphasizes the divine nature of each Person within the Trinity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Subordination within the Trinity&lt;/strong&gt;: While each Person of the Trinity is fully God, there is a sense of subordination among them. Scripture reveals that the Holy Spirit is subordinate to both the Father and the Son, and Jesus is subordinate to the Father. This internal relationship does not diminish the deity of any Person within the Trinity but reflects the mystery of their unity and roles (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/22/Luke-22-42.html"&gt;Luke 22:42&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/5/John-5-36.html"&gt;John 5:36&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/16/John-16-13.html"&gt;John 16:13-14&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Distinct Roles&lt;/strong&gt;: Each member of the Trinity has different tasks. The Father is the ultimate source and initiator of creation, revelation, salvation, and Jesus' works (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-Corinthians/8/1-Corinthians-8-6.html"&gt;1 Corinthians 8:6&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/3/John-3-16.html"&gt;John 3:16-17&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/5/John-5-17.html"&gt;John 5:17&lt;/a&gt;). The Son acts as the agent through whom the Father accomplishes these works (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/1/John-1-3.html"&gt;John 1:3&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/16/John-16-12.html"&gt;John 16:12-15&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/11/Matthew-11-27.html"&gt;Matthew 11:27&lt;/a&gt;). The Holy Spirit serves as the means by which the Father carries out His works (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/1/Genesis-1-2.html"&gt;Genesis 1:2&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/16/John-16-13.html"&gt;John 16:13-14&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Acts/10/Acts-10-38.html"&gt;Acts 10:38&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the intricacies of the Trinity can be challenging, but it is important to remember that our finite minds cannot fully comprehend an infinite God. While efforts have been made to illustrate the Trinity through analogies like an egg or water, these analogies fall short in capturing the true essence of the Trinity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept of the Trinity holds significant theological importance because it shapes our understanding of God's nature and His relationship with humanity. Recognizing the triune nature of God allows us to comprehend how God can be both personal and transcendent, immanent and active in our lives. It also helps us appreciate the love and unity within the Godhead, as each Person of the Trinity is intimately involved in our salvation and spiritual growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reflect on how the concept of the Trinity impacts your understanding of God's nature and relationship with humanity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consider the implications of the Trinity for your own spiritual life. How does it affect your view of prayer, worship, and fellowship with God?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does recognizing the distinct roles within the Trinity deepen your appreciation for the work of each Person in your salvation?&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Bible, as the word of God, contains accurate prophetic content. One example is the prophecy that Christ would be born in Bethlehem of Judea, which was foretold in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Micah/5/Micah-5-2.html"&gt;Micah 5:2&lt;/a&gt;. Micah made this prophecy around 700 B.C., and it was fulfilled centuries …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;God's Knowledge of the Future&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bible, as the word of God, contains accurate prophetic content. One example is the prophecy that Christ would be born in Bethlehem of Judea, which was foretold in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Micah/5/Micah-5-2.html"&gt;Micah 5:2&lt;/a&gt;. Micah made this prophecy around 700 B.C., and it was fulfilled centuries later when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/2/Luke-2-1.html"&gt;Luke 2:1-20&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/2/Matthew-2-1.html"&gt;Matthew 2:1-12&lt;/a&gt;). This fulfillment demonstrates the accuracy and reliability of the Bible's prophetic claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peter Stoner, in his book "Science Speaks," has shown that the probability of coincidence in prophetic Scripture is extremely low. By examining just eight prophecies concerning Christ, Stoner found that the chance of any one man fulfilling all eight prophecies is 1 in 10 to the 17th power. That would be 1 chance in 100,000,000,000,000,000. Considering Jesus fulfilled many more than just eight prophecies, it is evident that the Bible accurately foretells the future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bible declares that God has the ability to foretell the future. &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/46/Isaiah-46-9.html"&gt;Isaiah 46:9-10&lt;/a&gt; states, "Remember the former things long past, for I am God, and there is no other; I am God and there is no one like Me, declaring the end from the beginning, and from ancient times things which have not been done, saying, 'My purpose will be established, and I will accomplish all My good pleasure.'" This passage emphasizes that God is unmatched in His ability to declare the end from the beginning. He can stand at the start and accurately predict what will happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God possesses omniscience; He knows everything that is actual and possible. Additionally, God is eternal (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/90/Psalm-90-2.html"&gt;Psalm 90:2&lt;/a&gt;). As an eternal and omniscient being, He has experienced our past, present, and future. He is the Alpha and Omega, the Beginning and the End (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Revelation/21/Revelation-21-6.html"&gt;Revelation 21:6&lt;/a&gt;). This means that God has complete knowledge of all time periods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there are still prophecies in the Bible that await fulfillment, we can trust that they will come to pass because God knows the future. Events are unfolding according to His plan and timing. As believers, we can take comfort in knowing that the one true, personal, eternal, and all-knowing God of the Bible holds the future in His hands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z9EeVRD43qA" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding God's knowledge of the future is crucial because it assures us of His sovereignty and trustworthiness. It demonstrates that God has a plan for our lives and for the world as a whole. This knowledge helps us navigate through uncertain times with confidence, knowing that God is in control. It also encourages us to seek His guidance and trust in His promises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does the fact that God knows the future impact your perspective on life's uncertainties?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does God's ability to accurately predict the future strengthen your faith in Him?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can you think of any other biblical prophecies that have been fulfilled? How does this reinforce your belief in the accuracy of God's word?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In what ways can understanding God's knowledge of the future bring comfort and hope in challenging times?&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The concept of an eternal God refers to a being who has no beginning and no end. In the Bible, we are told that God is eternal, existing from everlasting to everlasting (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/90/Psalm-90-2.html"&gt;Psalm 90:2&lt;/a&gt;). This means that God has always been, and will continue to exist forever …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Eternal God&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept of an eternal God refers to a being who has no beginning and no end. In the Bible, we are told that God is eternal, existing from everlasting to everlasting (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/90/Psalm-90-2.html"&gt;Psalm 90:2&lt;/a&gt;). This means that God has always been, and will continue to exist forever. It can be difficult for us, as humans who measure everything in time, to fully grasp the idea of something that has no beginning or end. However, the Bible simply starts with the statement "In the beginning God..." (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/1/Genesis-1-1.html"&gt;Genesis 1:1&lt;/a&gt;), implying that God already existed at the start of recorded time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Self-Existence of God&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Moses asked God what His name was, God replied, "I AM WHO I AM" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Exodus/3/Exodus-3-14.html"&gt;Exodus 3:14&lt;/a&gt;). This name signifies the real being of God, His self-existence. It means that He is the Being of beings and describes His eternality, immutability, and constancy in fulfilling His promises. The name "I AM" encompasses all time—past, present, and future. It emphasizes that not only is God what He is at present, but He has always been and will always be. This declaration from God Himself speaks to us through the pages of Scripture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Jesus Christ: The Eternal God Incarnate&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus Christ, as the incarnation of God, also affirmed His deity and eternality during His time on Earth. He declared to the people, "Before Abraham was born, I AM" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/8/John-8-58.html"&gt;John 8:58&lt;/a&gt;). By making this statement, Jesus was claiming to be God in human form. The Jews considered this blasphemy and sought to stone Him to death because declaring oneself to be the eternal God was seen as a grave offense. The apostle John further affirmed this truth about Jesus' nature when he wrote, "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/1/John-1-1.html"&gt;John 1:1&lt;/a&gt;). Jesus and His Father are one in essence, existing outside of time, and equally sharing the attribute of eternality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Creation Reveals God's Eternality&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_z6JL9eL_LQ" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/1/Romans-1-20.html"&gt;Romans 1:20&lt;/a&gt; tells us that God's eternal nature and power are evident through His creation. When we observe the natural world, we can see evidence of God's eternality. The sun and the heavenly bodies continue in their predictable orbits, season after season comes and goes, and trees produce leaves in spring and shed them in the fall. These consistent patterns testify to God's eternal power and plan for the Earth. Just as creation continues on its course, one day, God will create a new heaven and a new earth that will also endure for eternity. As believers in Christ, we will share in this eternal existence with our God, as we are created in His image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding God's eternality is essential because it reveals His infinite nature and sovereignty over all things. Recognizing that He has no beginning or end helps us grasp His timeless wisdom, love, and faithfulness. It reassures us that He is in control of our lives and has a plan that extends beyond our earthly existence. Knowing that Jesus Christ is the eternal God incarnate gives us confidence in His ability to save us and provide eternal life through faith in Him. It also challenges our understanding of time and encourages us to trust in God's perspective rather than our limited human understanding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take a moment to reflect on the concept of eternity. How does understanding God's eternality impact your view of Him? How does it influence your perspective on time? In what ways can you rely on God's timeless wisdom and love in your daily life? Consider how embracing the eternal nature of Christ can shape your faith and give you hope for the future.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/The Nature of God/Time and Place"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Unveiling the Divine Mystery of the Godhead: A Christian Exploration</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/godhead/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-06-30T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-06-30T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-06-30:/godhead/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Godhead&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The term "Godhead" appears three times in the King James Version of the Bible: &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Acts/17/Acts-17-29.html"&gt;Acts 17:29&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/1/Romans-1-20.html"&gt;Romans 1:20&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Colossians/2/Colossians-2-9.html"&gt;Colossians 2:9&lt;/a&gt;. Although these verses use slightly different Greek words, they all convey the same meaning: "deity" or "divine nature." The term "Godhead" refers to God's essential …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Godhead&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The term "Godhead" appears three times in the King James Version of the Bible: &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Acts/17/Acts-17-29.html"&gt;Acts 17:29&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/1/Romans-1-20.html"&gt;Romans 1:20&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Colossians/2/Colossians-2-9.html"&gt;Colossians 2:9&lt;/a&gt;. Although these verses use slightly different Greek words, they all convey the same meaning: "deity" or "divine nature." The term "Godhead" refers to God's essential nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Acts/17/Acts-17-29.html"&gt;Acts 17:29&lt;/a&gt; - The Only True God&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Acts 17, the apostle Paul is speaking to the philosophers of Athens on Mars Hill. As he argues against idolatry, Paul says, "Forasmuch then as we are the offspring of God, we ought not to think that the Godhead is like unto gold, or silver, or stone, graven by art and man's device" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Acts/17/Acts-17-29.html"&gt;Acts 17:29&lt;/a&gt;, KJV).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul uses the term "Godhead" to emphasize that there is only one true God. The Greek word used here is "theos," which is a general term used by the Greeks to denote any deity. By using this term, Paul is referring to the only true God in contrast to the false gods made by human hands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Understanding that there is only one true God helps us avoid idolatry and recognize the importance of worshiping Him alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; In what ways do people today create their own idols or false gods?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/1/Romans-1-20.html"&gt;Romans 1:20&lt;/a&gt; - God's Divine Nature Revealed&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Romans 1, Paul begins to make the case that all humanity stands guilty before God. In verse 20, he says, "For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse" (KJV).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, the Greek word for "Godhead" is "theiotēs," which refers to divine nature. Paul's argument is that all of creation reveals God's existence and attributes. The natural world, with its intricate design and complexity, bears witness to God's eternal power and divine nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Recognizing God's divine nature in creation helps us understand His greatness and appreciate the beauty and complexity of the world around us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; How does observing nature reveal God's eternal power and divine nature to you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Colossians/2/Colossians-2-9.html"&gt;Colossians 2:9&lt;/a&gt; - The Deity of Christ&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Colossians/2/Colossians-2-9.html"&gt;Colossians 2:9&lt;/a&gt; is one of the clearest statements in the Bible regarding the deity of Christ. It says, "For in him [Christ] dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily." The Greek word used here for "Godhead" is "theotēs."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to this verse, Jesus Christ is the incarnation of the Godhead. He embodies the fullness of God's divine essence. This truth aligns with &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Colossians/1/Colossians-1-19.html"&gt;Colossians 1:19&lt;/a&gt;, which states that God was pleased to have all His fullness dwell in Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Understanding the deity of Christ helps us grasp the significance of His life, death, and resurrection. It also reveals His unique role in our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; How does knowing that Jesus embodies the fullness of the Godhead affect your understanding of His identity and purpose?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary, the term "Godhead" refers to the essence of the Divine Being. It emphasizes that there is only one true God and serves as a reminder to worship Him alone. The concept of Godhead also highlights how creation reveals God's eternal power and divine nature. Furthermore, &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Colossians/2/Colossians-2-9.html"&gt;Colossians 2:9&lt;/a&gt; confirms the deity of Christ, emphasizing that Jesus embodies the fullness of the Godhead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remembering these truths can deepen our understanding of God's nature and His plan for our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/The Nature of God/Singularity"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>7 Powerful Reasons Why God is Great: A Christian's Ultimate Guide to Divine Greatness</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/god-is-great/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-06-27T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-06-27T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-06-27:/god-is-great/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;God is Great&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Bible, God is described as great in numerous verses, such as &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/145/Psalm-145-3.html"&gt;Psalm 145:3&lt;/a&gt; which declares, “Great is the LORD and most worthy of praise; his greatness no one can fathom.” The word "great" in this context means preeminent, above the norm, or distinguished. It …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;God is Great&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Bible, God is described as great in numerous verses, such as &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/145/Psalm-145-3.html"&gt;Psalm 145:3&lt;/a&gt; which declares, “Great is the LORD and most worthy of praise; his greatness no one can fathom.” The word "great" in this context means preeminent, above the norm, or distinguished. It signifies God's superior character and quality, setting Him apart from human beings we may consider great. When the Bible describes God as great, it calls attention to His worthiness to be worshiped and adored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout the Bible, we see evidence of God's greatness through His wondrous works. He is described as having great love (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-John/3/1-John-3-1.html"&gt;1 John 3:1&lt;/a&gt;), great patience (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/9/Romans-9-22.html"&gt;Romans 9:22&lt;/a&gt;), great faithfulness (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Lamentations/3/Lamentations-3-22.html"&gt;Lamentations 3:22&lt;/a&gt;–23), and incomparably great power (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Ephesians/1/Ephesians-1-19.html"&gt;Ephesians 1:19&lt;/a&gt;). Jesus is referred to as our great God and Savior (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Titus/2/Titus-2-13.html"&gt;Titus 2:13&lt;/a&gt;) and a great priest over the house of God (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/10/Hebrews-10-21.html"&gt;Hebrews 10:21&lt;/a&gt;). The crowd was amazed at the greatness of God when Jesus cast out a demon from a boy (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/9/Luke-9-43.html"&gt;Luke 9:43&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Limitless Greatness of God&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God's greatness cannot be compared to anything or anyone else. He created everything in existence, making Him far superior to His creations. He is bigger than any being and cannot be confined by time or space. His wisdom surpasses human understanding, using what may seem foolish to confound those who think themselves wise. While all created things are finite, God is infinite. He defines greatness itself, and all other uses of the word are mere echoes of His greatness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the greatness of God helps us develop a proper perspective of His sovereignty and majesty. It reminds us that He is above all and worthy of our worship and adoration. Recognizing God's greatness also humbles us, as we realize our own limitations and the need to rely on Him for wisdom, guidance, and salvation. It encourages us to approach Him with awe and reverence, seeking to align our lives with His will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take a moment to reflect on the greatness of God. Consider His wondrous works throughout history and how they reveal His power and love. How does recognizing God's greatness impact your relationship with Him? In what ways can you express your awe and reverence for Him in your daily life?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Greatness of God in Creation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the ways we see the greatness of God is through His creation. &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/1/Genesis-1-1.html"&gt;Genesis 1:1&lt;/a&gt; tells us that "In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth." This act of creation demonstrates His immense power and wisdom. The complexity and beauty we observe in the natural world point to a Creator who is far greater than anything we can comprehend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Marvels of the Universe&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we look up at the night sky and contemplate the vastness of the universe, we are reminded of God's greatness. The countless stars, galaxies, and celestial bodies all testify to His power and creativity. The sheer size and intricacy of the cosmos reveal a Creator who is beyond our comprehension. As &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/19/Psalm-19-1.html"&gt;Psalm 19:1&lt;/a&gt; says, "The heavens declare the glory of God; the skies proclaim the work of his hands."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Wonder of Life&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another testament to God's greatness can be seen in the complexity of life. From microscopic organisms to majestic animals, each creature showcases His design and purpose. The intricate systems within our bodies, such as the circulatory, respiratory, and nervous systems, highlight His wisdom and attention to detail. Even the tiniest cell contains a level of complexity that defies human understanding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recognizing the greatness of God in creation helps us appreciate His handiwork and understand our place in the world. It reminds us that we are part of a much larger story, intricately woven by a Creator who is infinitely greater than ourselves. Understanding that God is the source of all life and beauty can lead us to worship and praise Him for His marvelous works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KBD18rsVJHk" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take a moment to observe the natural world around you. Consider the diversity of plants and animals, the awe-inspiring landscapes, and the delicate balance of ecosystems. How does acknowledging God's greatness in creation impact your appreciation for the world? How can you be a better steward of the environment to honor and reflect God's greatness?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Greatness of God in History&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God's greatness is not only evident in creation but also in His interaction with humanity throughout history. From the Old Testament to the New Testament, we see His mighty acts and His faithfulness to His people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Exodus and the Red Sea&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most significant displays of God's greatness is seen in the Exodus story. God delivered the Israelites from slavery in Egypt through a series of miraculous events. The parting of the Red Sea, allowing the Israelites to cross on dry ground while drowning their pursuers, demonstrated God's power over nature and His commitment to His chosen people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Miracles of Jesus&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the New Testament, we witness the greatness of God through the ministry of Jesus Christ. Jesus performed numerous miracles, including healing the sick, raising the dead, and calming storms. These miracles showcased His authority over sickness, death, and creation itself. Each miracle pointed to His divine nature and revealed God's great love for humanity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding God's greatness in history helps us trust in His faithfulness and power in our own lives. Just as He acted mightily in the past, we can have confidence that He will continue to work in our present circumstances. Recognizing God's greatness in history also encourages us to seek His guidance and align our lives with His purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reflect on the stories of God's greatness in the Bible, such as the Exodus and the miracles of Jesus. How do these stories impact your faith and trust in God? In what ways can you look for God's greatness in your own life and circumstances?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Greatness of God in Salvation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God's greatness is ultimately revealed in His plan of salvation for humanity. Through Jesus Christ, God demonstrated His immense love and mercy, providing a way for us to be reconciled to Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Cross and Resurrection&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pinnacle of God's greatness is seen in the sacrificial death and resurrection of Jesus Christ. On the cross, Jesus bore the weight of humanity's sin, paying the price for our redemption. His resurrection from the dead conquered sin and death, displaying God's power over the forces that held humanity captive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Gift of Grace&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God's greatness is also evident in His offer of salvation by grace through faith. &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Ephesians/2/Ephesians-2-8.html"&gt;Ephesians 2:8-9&lt;/a&gt; declares, "For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith—and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God—not by works so that no one can boast." This gift of salvation demonstrates God's great love and mercy towards us, as we are unable to earn or deserve it on our own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding God's greatness in salvation brings hope, assurance, and gratitude. It reminds us that our salvation is not based on our own efforts but on God's unfathomable love and grace. Recognizing His greatness in salvation also compels us to share this good news with others, so they too can experience the life-transforming power of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider the magnitude of what God has accomplished through Jesus' death and resurrection. How does recognizing God's greatness in salvation impact your understanding of His love for you? How can you share this message of salvation with others and demonstrate God's greatness through your own life?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Response to God's Greatness&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In light of God's greatness, our response should be one of humble worship and adoration. &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/150/Psalm-150-2.html"&gt;Psalm 150:2&lt;/a&gt; urges us to praise Him for His acts of power and surpassing greatness. Recognizing His greatness should lead us to seek a deeper relationship with Him and align our lives with His will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Trust and Surrender&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trusting in God's greatness means surrendering our own plans and desires to His perfect will. It involves acknowledging that He knows what is best for us and submitting to His guidance. Trusting in His greatness also means relying on His strength and wisdom rather than our own understanding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Gratitude and Praise&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Expressing gratitude and offering praise are natural responses to God's greatness. When we recognize the immense love, power, and faithfulness of God, it should stir within us a deep sense of gratitude. We should offer Him our heartfelt thanks for His great works in our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Responding to God's greatness with trust, surrender, gratitude, and praise deepens our relationship with Him. It helps us grow in faith and draws us closer to His heart. As we actively live out our response to God's greatness, we become witnesses of His goodness and love to those around us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reflect on your own response to God's greatness. Are you trusting Him fully and surrendering your plans to His will? Are you expressing gratitude and offering praise for His work in your life? How can you actively respond to God's greatness today and live as a witness of His love?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God is truly great beyond measure. From the wonders of creation to the mighty acts throughout history to the salvation offered through Jesus Christ, His greatness is evident. Recognizing God's greatness helps us develop a proper perspective of His sovereignty, power, and love. It humbles us and leads us to worship and adore Him. Let us respond to God's greatness by trusting Him, surrendering to His will, expressing gratitude, and offering praise. May we continually seek a deeper relationship with Him and live as witnesses of His greatness in the world.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/The Nature of God/Attributes"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Divine Goodness Unveiled: Embracing the Ultimate Goodness of God</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/god-is-good/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-06-04T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-06-04T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-06-04:/god-is-good/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;God is Good&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God's goodness is an essential aspect of His nature. The Bible tells us that "God is light; in Him, there is no darkness at all" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-John/1/1-John-1-5.html"&gt;1 John 1:5&lt;/a&gt;). This means that God always acts according to what is right, true, and good. His goodness is inherent …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;God is Good&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God's goodness is an essential aspect of His nature. The Bible tells us that "God is light; in Him, there is no darkness at all" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-John/1/1-John-1-5.html"&gt;1 John 1:5&lt;/a&gt;). This means that God always acts according to what is right, true, and good. His goodness is inherent and cannot be separated from Him. God is the standard of all that is good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Nature of God's Goodness&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God's goodness means that He has no evil within Him. His intentions and motivations are always good, and He consistently does what is right. The outcome of His plan is always good as well (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/50/Genesis-50-20.html"&gt;Genesis 50:20&lt;/a&gt;). God's goodness extends from His nature to everything He does (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/119/Psalm-119-68.html"&gt;Psalm 119:68&lt;/a&gt;). It is a fundamental part of who He is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;God's Creation and Goodness&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything that God created was initially good (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/1/Genesis-1-31.html"&gt;Genesis 1:31&lt;/a&gt;). God's goodness is evident in the beauty and harmony of His creation. He can only create what is good because He Himself is fully good. Evil, on the other hand, is the absence of goodness and anything contrary to God's nature (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Habakkuk/1/Habakkuk-1-13.html"&gt;Habakkuk 1:13&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-John/1/1-John-1-5.html"&gt;1 John 1:5&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rGHMHVaKVy0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The Law as a Reflection of God's Goodness&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God's goodness is showcased in the Law He gave to Israel. The Law is holy, righteous, and good (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/7/Romans-7-12.html"&gt;Romans 7:12&lt;/a&gt;). It reflects God's character and reveals His standards for righteousness and justice. The Law was given for the well-being and benefit of His people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Thankfulness for God's Goodness&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God's goodness should lead us to thankfulness. We are encouraged to give thanks to the Lord because He is good (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/107/Psalm-107-1.html"&gt;Psalm 107:1&lt;/a&gt;). However, people often choose to reject or ignore God's goodness due to their sinful nature (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/3/John-3-19.html"&gt;John 3:19&lt;/a&gt;). In the Old Testament, the Israelites repeatedly forgot God's goodness and turned away from Him (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/78/Psalm-78-11.html"&gt;Psalm 78:11&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;God's Goodness and Redemption&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God's goodness is most clearly seen in His plan to redeem humanity from sin. The gospel is the "good news" that God sent His Son as the perfect sacrifice to forgive our sins. God desires that all people come to repentance and experience His goodness (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/2-Peter/3/2-Peter-3-9.html"&gt;2 Peter 3:9&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/2/Romans-2-4.html"&gt;Romans 2:4&lt;/a&gt;). Through Jesus, we can taste and see that the Lord is good (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/34/Psalm-34-8.html"&gt;Psalm 34:8&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding and acknowledging God's goodness is crucial for our relationship with Him. It helps us recognize His love, faithfulness, and righteousness. Knowing that God is good gives us hope and assurance in times of difficulty, knowing that He works all things for our ultimate good (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/8/Romans-8-28.html"&gt;Romans 8:28&lt;/a&gt;). It also challenges us to respond with gratitude and obedience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does recognizing God's goodness impact your view of Him and your relationship with Him?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In what ways can you cultivate a heart of thankfulness for God's goodness in your life?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does understanding God's goodness give you hope and assurance in challenging circumstances?&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the book of Genesis, there are verses that refer to God using plural constructions. For example, &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/1/Genesis-1-26.html"&gt;Genesis 1:26&lt;/a&gt; states, "Then God said, 'Let us make man in our image, in our likeness, and let them rule over the fish of the sea and the birds of the air, over the livestock, over all the earth, and over all the creatures that move along the ground.'" This raises the question of why God would refer to Himself in the plural.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a few possible explanations for this. One is that God was including the angels in His statement. In saying "us" and "our," God may have been speaking of all the heavenly host, including Himself. However, it's important to note that the Bible does not state that angels have the same "image" or "likeness" as God. These descriptions are given to humanity alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another possible explanation is that these verses represent a conversation within the Trinity. The Trinity is a Christian doctrine that teaches that God exists in three Persons: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. So when God refers to Himself in the plural, He could be having a "conversation" within the Trinity. The Old Testament hints at the plurality of God, and the New Testament clarifies this plurality with the doctrine of the Trinity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's important to understand that when we talk about God being plural, we do not mean that there are multiple gods. The Bible clearly states that there is only one God. For example, in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/45/Isaiah-45-5.html"&gt;Isaiah 45:5&lt;/a&gt;, 6, and 18, God says, "I am the LORD, and there is no other; there is no God besides Me." Polytheism, which is belief in multiple gods, contradicts countless other Scriptures that affirm the oneness of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we may not fully understand how the Trinity works, God has given us enough information to know that He exists as three Persons in one God. This concept is unique to Christianity and sets it apart from other religions. It is a mystery that we can explore and reflect on, deepening our understanding of God's nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/K1tmSZXgUu8" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the plural references to God in the Bible is important because it helps us grasp the complexity of God's nature. It shows us that God is not limited to our human understanding. The Trinity reveals that God is not just a distant, impersonal force, but a relational Being who desires to have a personal relationship with us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recognizing the plurality of God also highlights the importance of unity within the Christian faith. If God exists as a community of Persons, then we, as His followers, are called to live in unity and love with one another. The Trinity serves as a model for how we should relate to one another and work together for the common good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does the concept of the Trinity impact your understanding of God's love for you?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In what ways can the idea of God's plurality encourage unity within the Church?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reflect on your own understanding of God's nature. How does it align with the biblical teaching on the Trinity? Is there anything you need to adjust or learn more about?&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book of Revelation mentions the "seven spirits of God" several times, but their identity and significance may not be immediately clear. In order to understand the meaning behind this phrase, we need to carefully examine the context and symbolism presented in the book. Let's explore this topic further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Mention of the Seven Spirits of God in Revelation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book of Revelation refers to the seven spirits of God in several passages. In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Revelation/1/Revelation-1-4.html"&gt;Revelation 1:4-5&lt;/a&gt;, John addresses the seven churches in Asia and speaks of grace and peace coming from "him who is, and who was, and who is to come," the seven spirits before God's throne, and Jesus Christ. In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Revelation/3/Revelation-3-1.html"&gt;Revelation 3:1&lt;/a&gt;, Jesus is described as holding the seven spirits of God. Additionally, in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Revelation/4/Revelation-4-5.html"&gt;Revelation 4:5&lt;/a&gt;, there is a depiction of seven lamps blazing before God's throne, symbolizing the seven spirits of God. Finally, in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Revelation/5/Revelation-5-6.html"&gt;Revelation 5:6&lt;/a&gt;, the Lamb (referring to Jesus) is described as having seven eyes, which are identified as the seven spirits of God sent out into all the earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Identifying the Seven Spirits&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the passages do not explicitly state the identity of the seven spirits, we can arrive at a proper interpretation by examining other biblical references and considering the context. It is important to note that these spirits cannot be seven angelic beings like seraphim or cherubim because of the context provided in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Revelation/1/Revelation-1-4.html"&gt;Revelation 1:4&lt;/a&gt;. John attributes grace and peace to three sources: "him who is, and who was, and who is to come," the seven spirits before God's throne, and Jesus Christ. This triadic structure suggests a depiction of the Trinity—grace and peace are given by the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Revelation/3/Revelation-3-1.html"&gt;Revelation 3:1&lt;/a&gt;, Jesus is mentioned as holding the seven spirits of God. This aligns with &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/15/John-15-26.html"&gt;John 15:26&lt;/a&gt;, where Jesus states that He will send the Holy Spirit from the Father. These passages highlight the role of the Son as superior and the Spirit as subordinate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Revelation/4/Revelation-4-5.html"&gt;Revelation 4:5&lt;/a&gt; portrays the seven spirits of God as seven burning lamps before God's throne. This imagery resonates with Zechariah's vision (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Zechariah/4/Zechariah-4-2.html"&gt;Zechariah 4:2&lt;/a&gt;) where the Holy Spirit is symbolized as a solid gold lampstand with seven lamps. This connection strengthens the interpretation that the "seven spirits" refer to the Holy Spirit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Revelation/5/Revelation-5-6.html"&gt;Revelation 5:6&lt;/a&gt;, the "seven spirits" are equated with the "seven eyes" of the Lamb (Jesus). These eyes represent the omniscience of the Holy Spirit and Jesus, while their being sent out into all the earth indicates their omnipresence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Significance of "Seven"&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qAXZG6RUEdU" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once we identify the "seven spirits" as the Holy Spirit, we may wonder why there are specifically seven spirits mentioned. In biblical symbolism, the number seven often represents perfection and completion. Therefore, John's vision in Revelation includes a depiction of the perfect and complete Holy Spirit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/11/Isaiah-11-2.html"&gt;Isaiah 11:2&lt;/a&gt; also provides a seven-fold description of the Holy Spirit: "The Spirit of the LORD will rest on him—the Spirit of wisdom and of understanding, the Spirit of counsel and of power, the Spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the LORD." This prophecy describes how the Messiah would be empowered by one Spirit, but with seven distinct attributes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Spirit of the LORD&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Spirit of wisdom&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Spirit of understanding&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Spirit of counsel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Spirit of power&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Spirit of knowledge&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Spirit of the fear of the Lord&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This further supports the idea that the "seven spirits" in Revelation symbolize the Holy Spirit in the perfection of His manifold ministry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the meaning behind the "seven spirits of God" in Revelation helps us grasp the significance of the Holy Spirit's role in our lives. The Holy Spirit is not merely an impersonal force, but a divine Person within the Trinity. He plays a vital role in empowering and guiding believers, as depicted by the seven attributes mentioned in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/11/Isaiah-11-2.html"&gt;Isaiah 11:2&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recognizing the perfection and completion associated with the number seven also highlights the completeness of the Holy Spirit's work. As believers, we can find comfort and assurance knowing that the Holy Spirit, in all His fullness, is at work in us and throughout the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider how your understanding of the Holy Spirit might be deepened by recognizing His role as depicted in the "seven spirits of God." How does this knowledge impact your relationship with God and your reliance on the Holy Spirit's guidance?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you meditate on the significance of the number seven, contemplate how it reflects God's perfection and completeness. How does this understanding enhance your appreciation for God's work in your life and in the world?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, the "seven spirits of God" mentioned in the book of Revelation symbolize the Holy Spirit in His perfect and complete ministry. While specific identification is not explicitly provided, biblical context and symbolism support this interpretation. Understanding this symbolism enriches our understanding of the Holy Spirit's role in empowering and guiding believers. The number seven represents perfection and completion, emphasizing the completeness of the Holy Spirit's work. May this knowledge deepen our appreciation for God's presence and guidance through His Spirit.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/The Nature of God/Singularity"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Understanding the First Person of the Trinity: Unveiling the Mystery of God's Triune Nature</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/first-person-of-the-trinity/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-05-24T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-05-24T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-05-24:/first-person-of-the-trinity/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;The First Person of the Trinity&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Trinity is a concept in Christianity that describes God as existing eternally as three distinct Persons: the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Although the word "Trinity" is not found in the New Testament, Christians believe it best represents the nature of God as revealed to us. In this article, we will focus on the first Person of the Trinity, namely God the Father.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Concept of the Trinity&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/e2YZ0WweRQM" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The term Trinity does not imply a hierarchy or levels of importance among the Persons of the godhead. Instead, it emphasizes the equality and unity of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. As stated in the Athanasian Creed, "We worship one God in Trinity, and Trinity in Unity, neither confounding the persons, nor dividing the substance. For there is one Person of the Father, another of the Son, and another of the Holy Spirit. But the godhead of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit is all one, the glory equal, the majesty co-eternal." Thus, while each Person of the Trinity is co-eternal and co-equal ontologically (in their being), they play different roles when relating to humanity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The First Person of the Trinity&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/28/Matthew-28-19.html"&gt;Matthew 28:19&lt;/a&gt;, where Jesus gives the Trinitarian formula for baptism, He presents the Father first: "Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit." This order suggests that within the economic Trinity (how God relates to creation), the Father holds a primary position. However, it is important to note that this does not imply superiority or greater significance; rather, it signifies His role as initiator and leader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to being listed first in this formula, we can understand why God the Father is referred to as "first" by considering His priority within the economic Trinity. This is comparable to the head of a household who holds a leadership role. The Father sent Jesus into the world (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/6/John-6-57.html"&gt;John 6:57&lt;/a&gt;), and Jesus lived on earth in submission to the Father, doing only what He saw the Father doing (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/5/John-5-19.html"&gt;John 5:19&lt;/a&gt;). Furthermore, it is the Father who raised Jesus from the dead (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Acts/2/Acts-2-32.html"&gt;Acts 2:32&lt;/a&gt;) and will be glorified in the redemption of humanity (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Philippians/2/Philippians-2-9.html"&gt;Philippians 2:9&lt;/a&gt;–11).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the concept of the first Person of the Trinity helps us grasp how God reveals Himself and relates to humanity. It emphasizes the unity and equality of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit while acknowledging their distinct roles. Recognizing God the Father as the first Person of the Trinity highlights His position as leader and initiator within the godhead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider how knowing that God the Father holds a leadership role within the Trinity can impact your perception of God's character and His relationship with humanity. Reflect on how this understanding influences your own perspective on leadership and submission in your own life.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/The Nature of God/The Trinity"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Revealing God's Presence in Hell: A Christian Perspective</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/god-in-hell/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-05-24T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-05-24T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-05-24:/god-in-hell/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;God in Hell&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hell is a topic that has captured the curiosity and imagination of many throughout history. People often wonder about the nature of hell and whether or not God is present there. In this article, we will explore this question from a biblical perspective and seek to gain a deeper understanding of the relationship between God and hell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Omnipresence of God&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To begin our exploration, it is important to establish the concept of God's omnipresence. The Bible teaches that God is everywhere present. He is not confined to a specific location but fills the entirety of creation with His presence. &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/139/Psalm-139-7.html"&gt;Psalm 139:7-12&lt;/a&gt; beautifully expresses this truth, stating that no matter where we go, even to the depths of Sheol (which can be understood as the grave or the place of the dead), God is still there with us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is crucial to note that while God is present everywhere, His presence does not guarantee a relationship or fellowship with Him. This distinction becomes significant when considering the nature of hell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Hell as Separation from God&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ykt3e1x6Z_U" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hell is commonly understood as a place of punishment for those who reject Jesus Christ as their Savior. It is described as a place where people are removed from the presence of God (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/25/Matthew-25-41.html"&gt;Matthew 25:41&lt;/a&gt;). While God is omnipresent and aware of what transpires in hell, those who reside there do not have a relationship or communication with Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This concept can be challenging to grasp, as it seems contradictory for God to be present in hell while also being separated from it. However, by examining specific passages in the Bible, we can gain further insight into this apparent paradox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Different Terminology, Different Meanings&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two passages shed light on this topic: &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/2-Thessalonians/1/2-Thessalonians-1-7.html"&gt;2 Thessalonians 1:7-9&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Revelation/14/Revelation-14-10.html"&gt;Revelation 14:10&lt;/a&gt;. These verses initially appear to contradict each other regarding the presence of God in hell. However, a closer examination reveals that the original Greek language used in these passages offers a solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Revelation/14/Revelation-14-10.html"&gt;Revelation 14:10&lt;/a&gt;, the word "presence" is a literal translation of the Greek word "enopion," which implies spatial proximity. It suggests a measurable distance between God and those who are tormented. On the other hand, in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/2-Thessalonians/1/2-Thessalonians-1-7.html"&gt;2 Thessalonians 1:7-9&lt;/a&gt;, the word "presence" is translated from the Greek term "prosopon," which primarily refers to a person's face or outward appearance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drawing from these distinctions, we can understand that while God may be spatially present in hell, His favor and fellowship are entirely absent. Hell becomes a place of complete separation from the blessings and wholeness that come from being in communion with God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the presence of God in hell has significant implications for our understanding of His justice and righteousness. God's omnipresence necessitates that He knows what occurs in hell, and His justice demands punishment for those who reject Him. The existence of hell serves as a testament to God's justice, as it is the consequence of rejecting the salvation offered through Jesus Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, recognizing the separation between God and hell emphasizes the importance of choosing a relationship with Him in this life. The Bible repeatedly urges us to seek God, accept His grace, and trust in Jesus for salvation to avoid the eternal separation from Him that hell represents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contemplating the presence of God in hell can evoke several questions and reflections:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does the idea of God's omnipresence influence your understanding of His character and attributes?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does the concept of hell challenge your view of God's love and justice? How do you reconcile these seemingly conflicting aspects?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What does it mean to have a relationship with God? How does this understanding impact your choices and priorities in life?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does knowing that God is present in hell, yet separated from it, affect your appreciation for the salvation offered through Jesus Christ?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we grapple with these questions, it is essential to approach the topic of God in hell with humility and reverence. While we may not fully comprehend the complexities of this subject, we can trust in the wisdom and righteousness of God, who holds all things in His hands.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/The Nature of God/Time and Place"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>God Rock Heavy Lift: Discover the Ultimate Power of Faith</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/god-rock-heavy-lift/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-05-24T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-05-24T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-05-24:/god-rock-heavy-lift/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Can God Create a Rock So Heavy He Cannot Lift It?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One common question asked by skeptics of God, the Bible, and Christianity is whether God can create a rock so heavy that He cannot lift it. This question challenges the concept of God's omnipotence, suggesting that if He can …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Can God Create a Rock So Heavy He Cannot Lift It?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One common question asked by skeptics of God, the Bible, and Christianity is whether God can create a rock so heavy that He cannot lift it. This question challenges the concept of God's omnipotence, suggesting that if He can create such a rock, then He is not truly all-powerful. On the other hand, if He cannot create such a rock, then He is also not all-powerful. This argument posits that omnipotence is self-contradictory, therefore concluding that God cannot be omnipotent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, this question is based on a misunderstanding of the terms "almighty" or "omnipotent." These terms do not imply that God can do absolutely anything. Rather, they describe the extent of God's power. Power is the ability to effect change or make something happen. The Bible affirms that God has unlimited power (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Job/11/Job-11-7.html"&gt;Job 11:7-11&lt;/a&gt;, 37:23; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/2-Corinthians/6/2-Corinthians-6-18.html"&gt;2 Corinthians 6:18&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Revelation/4/Revelation-4-8.html"&gt;Revelation 4:8&lt;/a&gt;). Therefore, God can do whatever is possible to be done. However, He cannot do things that are actually impossible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea of true impossibility is not based on the amount of power one possesses but on what is genuinely possible. Adding more power does not make the truly impossible possible. Thus, unless context indicates otherwise, impossibility has the same meaning regardless of God's involvement (e.g., &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/19/Matthew-19-26.html"&gt;Matthew 19:26&lt;/a&gt; contrasting man's ability with God's).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the limits of God's omnipotence is crucial for grasping the nature of God and His relationship with creation. It helps us avoid misconceptions about what it means for God to be all-powerful and ensures that we approach theological questions with a clear understanding of His attributes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LcJkyarOQCk" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider how our understanding of God's omnipotence affects our perspective on His character and the nature of reality. How does recognizing the difference between what is possible and impossible affect our faith in God's power? How might this understanding impact our trust in God's promises and His ability to fulfill them?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;God's Nature and the Nature of Reality&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bible itself acknowledges certain things that God cannot do, such as lying or denying Himself (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/6/Hebrews-6-18.html"&gt;Hebrews 6:18&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/2-Timothy/2/2-Timothy-2-13.html"&gt;2 Timothy 2:13&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Titus/1/Titus-1-2.html"&gt;Titus 1:2&lt;/a&gt;). These limitations arise from the nature of God and the nature of reality itself. God cannot do what is genuinely impossible to be done, like creating a two-sided triangle or a married bachelor. These things are contradictions and truly impossible within the framework of reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The notion that God can create a rock so heavy that He cannot lift it falls into the category of a contradiction. In order for a rock to defeat an infinite amount of lifting power, it would need to be infinitely large. However, material objects cannot be infinite, only God is infinite. The concept of two infinites is contradictory, and therefore, such a rock cannot exist. Consequently, the question of whether God can create a rock that He cannot lift is essentially asking if God can make a contradiction, which is something He cannot do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recognizing the limits of what God can do helps us grasp His nature more fully. It prevents us from assigning contradictory expectations to Him and allows us to understand that some things are inherently impossible due to their contradictory nature. This understanding deepens our appreciation for the coherence and consistency of God's character.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider how understanding that God cannot do what is genuinely impossible affects your perception of His reliability and trustworthiness. How does this understanding impact your understanding of the biblical accounts and miracles performed by Jesus? Does it challenge or reinforce your faith in God's power?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, the question of whether God can create a rock so heavy that He cannot lift it is based on a misconception of God's omnipotence. Being almighty does not mean that God can do anything, but rather, that He possesses unlimited power within the bounds of what is genuinely possible. True impossibility is not overcome by adding more power. God's inability to do what is genuinely impossible does not diminish His omnipotence but instead highlights the consistency and coherence of His nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the limits of God's power helps us avoid misconceptions and deepen our understanding of His character. Recognizing that some things are inherently impossible due to their contradictory nature allows us to approach theological questions with clarity and discernment. Ultimately, this understanding reinforces our faith in God's power and reliability as we trust in His ability to accomplish what is possible within His nature and the scope of reality.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/The Nature of God/Attributes"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>How Old is God According to the Bible</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/how-old-is-god/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-05-24T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-05-24T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-05-24:/how-old-is-god/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;How Old is God According to the Bible?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the Bible, God has no age as He exists eternally, without beginning or end. Scripture states "Before the mountains were brought forth... from everlasting to everlasting you are God" (Psalm 90:2). As the Creator of time itself, God exists outside temporal limitations. Biblical names like "I AM" (Exodus 3:14) and "Alpha and Omega" (Revelation 1:8) emphasize His eternal nature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Understanding Time in the Bible&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;God's Creation of Time&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bible shows God existed before time and created it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Creation of Time Markers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/1/Genesis-1-1.html"&gt;Genesis 1:1&lt;/a&gt;: "In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/1/Genesis-1-14.html"&gt;Genesis 1:14&lt;/a&gt;: "Let there be lights in the expanse of the heavens to separate the day from the night. And let them be for signs and for seasons, and for days and years"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;God's Relationship to Time&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/2-Peter/3/2-Peter-3-8.html"&gt;2 Peter 3:8&lt;/a&gt;: "With the Lord one day is as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/102/Psalm-102-24.html"&gt;Psalm 102:24-27&lt;/a&gt;: "Your years endure throughout all generations... they will perish, but you will remain"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Biblical Timeline and God's Existence&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bible presents a clear timeline showing God's existence:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Before Creation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;God exists eternally&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No beginning point mentioned&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Active before universe creation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Creation Week&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;God creates time (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/1/Genesis-1-1.html"&gt;Genesis 1:1-5&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Establishes day/night cycle&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sets up celestial time markers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Throughout History&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Present in all biblical events&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consistently described as eternal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Never changes or ages&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Future Eternity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Revelation/1/Revelation-1-4.html"&gt;Revelation 1:4&lt;/a&gt;: "who is and who was and who is to come"&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Exists beyond end of current creation&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The Meaning of "I AM"&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When God revealed Himself to Moses in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Exodus/3/Exodus-3-14.html"&gt;Exodus 3:14&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hebrew Name Explanation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;YHWH (יהוה) means "I AM WHO I AM"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Indicates eternal present existence&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shows existence independent of time&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Biblical Usage&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Used over 6,800 times in Old Testament&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consistently represents eternal nature&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Connected to God's unchanging character&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;El Olam (עוֹלָם אֵל)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Meaning: The Everlasting God&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First used in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/21/Genesis-21-33.html"&gt;Genesis 21:33&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emphasizes God's eternal existence&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ancient of Days&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Used in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Daniel/7/Daniel-7-9.html"&gt;Daniel 7:9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Represents eternal authority&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shows God's existence before time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Common Questions About God's Age&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Does God Have a Beginning?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bible clearly teaches that God has no beginning:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Biblical Evidence&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Never mentions God's beginning&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Describes God before creation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uses terms indicating eternal existence&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scriptural Support&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/93/Psalm-93-2.html"&gt;Psalm 93:2&lt;/a&gt;: "Your throne is established from of old; you are from everlasting"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/43/Isaiah-43-13.html"&gt;Isaiah 43:13&lt;/a&gt;: "From eternity I am He"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Can We Calculate God's Age?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bible shows why God's age cannot be calculated:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Beyond Time&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exists outside time framework&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Created time itself&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not bound by temporal limits&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Biblical Perspective&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No starting point to measure from&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eternal nature transcends measurement&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exists in eternal present&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Biblical Summary of God's Age&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Scripture:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;God is Eternal&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No beginning&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No end&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outside time itself&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Biblical Proof&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consistent testimony throughout Scripture&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Multiple divine names indicating eternality&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clear statements about God's timeless nature&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Truth&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;God doesn't have an age in human terms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exists eternally past and future&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Created and transcends time itself&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This biblical understanding shows that asking "How old is God?" reflects our time-bound perspective. The Bible consistently teaches that God exists eternally, without beginning or end, transcending the very concept of age itself.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/The Nature of God/Time and Place"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Unveiling the Limitations of What God Cannot Do: A Christian Perspective</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/god-cannot/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-05-16T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-05-16T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-05-16:/god-cannot/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;God's Limitless Power and Wisdom&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we gaze up at the stars on a clear night, we are reminded of the awe-inspiring power and wisdom of God. Genesis 1 tells us that God created every single star in the universe. Just think about the incredible power contained within one star! But it's not just about raw power; there is also intelligence and design woven into every aspect of our universe, from the smallest DNA strand to the tiniest subatomic particle. God's power and wisdom are truly beyond our comprehension.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/18/Genesis-18-14.html"&gt;Genesis 18:14&lt;/a&gt;, the Lord asks Abraham, "Is anything too hard for the Lord?" This rhetorical question emphasizes that nothing is too difficult or impossible for God. Similarly, when Moses questioned how God could possibly provide enough meat for several million Israelites in the wilderness, God responded by asking Moses if His arm was too short (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Numbers/11/Numbers-11-23.html"&gt;Numbers 11:23&lt;/a&gt;). In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-Samuel/14/1-Samuel-14-6.html"&gt;1 Samuel 14:6&lt;/a&gt;, Jonathan tells his armor bearer that victory does not require a large army because the Lord can bring about triumph with just a few soldiers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Jeremiah/32/Jeremiah-32-17.html"&gt;Jeremiah 32:17&lt;/a&gt; proclaims, "Ah Lord God! Behold, You have made the heavens and the earth by Your great power and outstretched arm. There is nothing too hard for You" (KJV). This verse affirms that God's power knows no bounds. Even in the spiritual realm, those who seem far from salvation are not beyond God's reach (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/10/Mark-10-25.html"&gt;Mark 10:25-27&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God's power extends to His love and mercy as well. He loves us to such an extent that He was willing to send His own Son, Jesus Christ, to die on the cross of Calvary and pay the penalty for our sins. This act of supreme sacrifice demonstrates His immense love and mercy towards fallen humanity. &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/3/John-3-16.html"&gt;John 3:16&lt;/a&gt; beautifully captures this truth: "For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life" (KJV). God's love is not limited to "good" people because there are none. Instead, His love is extended to all of us, sinful and rebellious as we are (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/3/Romans-3-10.html"&gt;Romans 3:10-23&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Limits of God's Actions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5MChgCghLJg" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While God's power is limitless, there are certain things that He cannot do because they would contradict His character and nature. For example, &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Titus/1/Titus-1-2.html"&gt;Titus 1:2&lt;/a&gt; tells us that God cannot lie. This is rooted in His holiness, for He is completely without sin (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/6/Isaiah-6-3.html"&gt;Isaiah 6:3&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-Peter/1/1-Peter-1-16.html"&gt;1 Peter 1:16&lt;/a&gt;). Furthermore, because of His justice, God cannot simply overlook sin. However, through the sacrifice of Jesus Christ, He is able to forgive those who place their faith in Him (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/53/Isaiah-53-1.html"&gt;Isaiah 53:1-12&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/3/Romans-3-26.html"&gt;Romans 3:26&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the limitless power and wisdom of God has profound implications for our lives as Christians. It reminds us that no matter what challenges we face, God is more than capable of handling them. We can trust in His strength and wisdom to guide us through any trial or difficulty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recognizing the depth of God's love and mercy also helps us grasp the incredible grace extended to us through the sacrifice of Jesus Christ. We are reminded that we do not deserve this forgiveness, yet it is freely offered to us. This knowledge should inspire gratitude and motivate us to live lives that honor and serve God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Think About It&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does contemplating the power and wisdom of God impact your faith?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In what ways can you rely on God's strength and wisdom in your own life?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does understanding the depth of God's love and mercy affect how you view yourself and others?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consider the sacrifice of Jesus on the cross. How does this act of love demonstrate the extent of God's love for humanity?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can you express gratitude for God's forgiveness and respond to it in your daily life?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By reflecting on these questions, we can deepen our understanding of God's limitless power, wisdom, love, and mercy. May we continually seek to honor and trust in Him, knowing that He is always present and ready to help us in times of trouble (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/46/Psalm-46-1.html"&gt;Psalm 46:1&lt;/a&gt;, ESV).&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/The Nature of God/Attributes"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Ultimate Guide: Is God Logical?

&lt;p&gt;Belief in God and the idea of God can be approached from two perspectives: whether it is logical to believe in God and whether God Himself is a logical being. Both perspectives lead us to the conclusion that yes, God is logical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1. Logical Answers to Philosophical …&lt;/h3&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Is God Logical?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Belief in God and the idea of God can be approached from two perspectives: whether it is logical to believe in God and whether God Himself is a logical being. Both perspectives lead us to the conclusion that yes, God is logical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1. Logical Answers to Philosophical Questions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Believing in God is logical because it provides consistent answers to important philosophical questions. For example, the concept of an infinite amount of past time is illogical since it would mean we are currently at the "end" of an infinite string of moments. Therefore, there must have been a beginning moment, which necessitates a cause that is itself non-caused. Logically, this cause is God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2. Fine-Tuning of the Universe&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another reason belief in God is logical is that the universe appears to be precisely designed to allow for life, particularly complex life that is self-aware. This intricate arrangement leaves us with two possible explanations: some kind of God or random luck. However, attributing it to mere luck is not a logical answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;3. The Existence of Logic Itself&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact that human beings think logically supports the idea of God as a rational belief. If God does not exist, then intelligence, purpose, and meaning are merely illusions created by physics and chemistry. Without God, our thoughts lack meaning and cannot be relied upon as accurate reflections of reality. Belief in logic requires belief in some kind of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;4. Objectivity, Eternality, and Non-Materiality&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those who believe in the laws of logic rely on something objective, eternal, and non-material. It would be hypocritical for someone who values logic to object to the idea of an immaterial, eternal, and objective God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;5. Logical Nature of God&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God Himself is logical based on His words and actions. He plans, communicates, discusses, and acts. He even speaks of "reasoning" with human beings. God distinguishes between truth and falsehood, a fundamental aspect of basic logic. Although His actions may not always align with human preferences, this does not make them illogical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eINsKdc7K-k" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;6. The Nature of a Perfect Being&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact that there are certain things God "cannot" do, such as lie or change, is evidence of His logical nature. A truly perfect being, by definition, cannot change without ceasing to be perfect. Therefore, God cannot contradict His own nature without violating the laws of logic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the logical nature of God helps us to strengthen our faith and provides a rational foundation for our beliefs. It allows us to engage in meaningful discussions and address philosophical questions that may arise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider how the existence of logic itself points towards the existence of God. Reflect on the implications of a logical God and how it aligns with your understanding of His character and actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, God is indeed logical. Belief in God provides consistent answers to important philosophical questions, the fine-tuning of the universe supports the existence of a Creator, and the fact that we think logically points towards a rational belief in God. Furthermore, God's words and actions demonstrate His logical nature, and His inability to contradict His own nature affirms His adherence to the laws of logic. Understanding the logical nature of God strengthens our faith and provides a rational basis for our beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/The Nature of God/Attributes"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Unveiling the Divine: 5 Communicable and Incommunicable Attributes of God</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/communicable-incommunicable-attributes/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-05-15T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-05-15T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-05-15:/communicable-incommunicable-attributes/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Communicable and Incommunicable Attributes of God&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The attributes of God can be divided into two categories: communicable and incommunicable. Communicable attributes are those that humans can also possess, although only to a finite extent. Incommunicable attributes, on the other hand, are exclusive to God and cannot be shared with His creatures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Communicable Attributes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Love&lt;/strong&gt;: God is love, and humans can also love, although imperfectly. Our ability to love is derived from God's love for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Justice&lt;/strong&gt;: While humans have a sense of justice and can carry out justice, we do so imperfectly. God, however, is perfectly just.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Creativity&lt;/strong&gt;: God is the Creator, and while humans are creative, we cannot create ex nihilo (out of nothing) as God can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grace and Mercy&lt;/strong&gt;: God extends grace and mercy towards us, and as we grow in Christ and are transformed by the Holy Spirit, we can also exhibit these attributes in a more meaningful and perfected sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Goodness&lt;/strong&gt;: God is inherently good, and we are called to reflect His goodness in our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Truthfulness&lt;/strong&gt;: God is the source of all truth, and as followers of Christ, we are called to live in truthfulness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rational Thought&lt;/strong&gt;: Humans have been created in the image of God, which includes the capacity for rational thought and reasoning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Relationality&lt;/strong&gt;: God exists in perfect relationship within the Trinity, and we are created for relationship with Him and with others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the communicable attributes of God helps us to realize that as His image-bearers, we have been designed to reflect His character in our lives. It also highlights our need for the transforming work of the Holy Spirit to help us grow in these attributes and become more like Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can you grow in exhibiting the communicable attributes of God in your own life? &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In what ways do you see these attributes reflected in the lives of other believers?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Incommunicable Attributes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bcbL6J7vzbQ" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Omnipotence&lt;/strong&gt;: God is all-powerful, and His power is beyond human comprehension. We can define this attribute, but we cannot fully comprehend or possess it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Immutable&lt;/strong&gt;: God is unchanging, while humans are subject to change and growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Self-Existence&lt;/strong&gt;: God exists independently of anything else, whereas humans are dependent on Him for our existence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recognizing and honoring the incommunicable attributes of God reminds us of His uniqueness and greatness. It calls us to revere, worship, trust, and praise the Creator who possesses these attributes that are beyond our comprehension.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does recognizing God's omnipotence, immutability, and self-existence impact your understanding of who He is?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can focusing on these incommunicable attributes deepen your awe and reverence for God?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, the communicable attributes of God are those that humans can possess to a finite extent. These include love, justice, creativity, grace, mercy, goodness, truthfulness, rational thought, and relationality. As we grow in Christ and are transformed by the Holy Spirit, we can exhibit these attributes more meaningfully. On the other hand, the incommunicable attributes of God are exclusive to Him and include omnipotence, immutability, and self-existence. Recognizing both sets of attributes helps us understand our relationship with God and our purpose as His image-bearers. Let us strive to reflect His communicable attributes while acknowledging and revering His incommunicable attributes.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/The Nature of God/Attributes"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Discovering the Divine: What God is Really Like</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/what-is-god-like/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-05-15T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-05-15T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-05-15:/what-is-god-like/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;What is God Like?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every culture throughout history has had its own understanding of what God is like. Some have believed that God controls the weather and depicted Him as a storm god throwing lightning bolts (Baal worship in Canaan). Others worshiped the sun, considering it the most powerful entity (Ra worship in Egypt). Pantheistic beliefs saw God as being present in everything, while some turned to agnosticism or worshiped an "Unknown God" to cover all bases (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Acts/17/Acts-17-23.html"&gt;Acts 17:23&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, these assumptions only provide a partial picture of who God truly is. While it is true that God controls the weather, He also has control over much more. He is more powerful than the sun, and He transcends everything. Thankfully, even though there are aspects of God that we may not fully understand, He has revealed Himself to us through the Bible. In fact, God desires to be known (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/46/Psalm-46-10.html"&gt;Psalm 46:10&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Norman Geisler and Frank Turek, in their book "I Don't Have Enough Faith to Be an Atheist," provide some important insights into the nature of truth. They state that truth is discovered, not invented, and it exists independently of anyone's knowledge of it. Truth is also transcultural, meaning that if something is true, it applies to all people, everywhere, at all times. Furthermore, truth is unchanging even though our beliefs about truth may change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, as we seek to understand what God is like, we are simply seeking to discover truths that already exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;God's Existence&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First and foremost, the Bible asserts that God exists. It does not argue for His existence; it simply states it. The fact that God exists should be self-evident through the works He has created (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/19/Psalm-19-1.html"&gt;Psalm 19:1-6&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/1/Genesis-1-1.html"&gt;Genesis 1:1&lt;/a&gt; declares, "In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth." This simple yet powerful statement reveals that God created the entire universe, including time, space, matter, and energy, by His own decree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Albert Einstein's Theory of General Relativity affirms that all time, space, and matter had a definite, simultaneous beginning. According to the law of causality, what has a beginning has a cause. Therefore, God serves as the ultimate cause behind the existence of all things. He is not only the creator of everything but also almighty (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Joel/1/Joel-1-15.html"&gt;Joel 1:15&lt;/a&gt;), eternally self-existent (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/90/Psalm-90-2.html"&gt;Psalm 90:2&lt;/a&gt;), and beyond everything in creation (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/97/Psalm-97-9.html"&gt;Psalm 97:9&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the same God who created all things also exercises control over them. He is sovereign (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/46/Isaiah-46-10.html"&gt;Isaiah 46:10&lt;/a&gt;). A person who creates something owns it and possesses the authority to utilize it as they see fit. As &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/44/Isaiah-44-24.html"&gt;Isaiah 44:24&lt;/a&gt; states, God is the One "who has made all things, who alone stretched out the heavens, who spread out the earth by myself." The following verse emphasizes that He can overthrow the knowledge of the wise and render it meaningless. Clearly, God possesses the power to do as He pleases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Nature of God&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God is not a physical being that can be represented by any created thing. In fact, any attempt to create such a representation is considered blasphemous (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Exodus/20/Exodus-20-4.html"&gt;Exodus 20:4-6&lt;/a&gt;). Instead, God is spirit (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/4/John-4-24.html"&gt;John 4:24&lt;/a&gt;), existing in a non-physical form. He is unchanging (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Malachi/3/Malachi-3-6.html"&gt;Malachi 3:6&lt;/a&gt;), meaning His character and attributes remain constant throughout time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gs_gY1K1AMU" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;God is all-knowing (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-John/3/1-John-3-20.html"&gt;1 John 3:20&lt;/a&gt;) and present everywhere (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/139/Psalm-139-7.html"&gt;Psalm 139:7-13&lt;/a&gt;). His knowledge encompasses everything, and He is present in every corner of creation. Additionally, God is holy and glorious (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/6/Isaiah-6-3.html"&gt;Isaiah 6:3&lt;/a&gt;), meaning He is set apart and possesses an awe-inspiring majesty. He is just (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Deuteronomy/32/Deuteronomy-32-4.html"&gt;Deuteronomy 32:4&lt;/a&gt;) and will righteously judge all sin and unrighteousness (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Jude/1/Jude-1-15.html"&gt;Jude 1:15&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept of God's judgment highlights another important aspect of His nature: He is a moral being. C. S. Lewis, in his book "Mere Christianity," argues that just as there are observable laws of nature (such as gravity and entropy), there are also observable laws of morality. Lewis states, "First, that human beings, all over the earth, have this curious idea that they ought to behave in a certain way, and cannot really get rid of it. Secondly, that they do not in fact behave in that way. They know the Law of Nature; they break it." This universal belief in right and wrong reflects the nature of God who created us in His image (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/1/Genesis-1-26.html"&gt;Genesis 1:26&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Ecclesiastes/3/Ecclesiastes-3-11.html"&gt;Ecclesiastes 3:11&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Jesus Reveals God&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus Christ, during His time on Earth, provided a unique glimpse into the nature of God. He declared that anyone who had seen Him had seen the Father (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/14/John-14-7.html"&gt;John 14:7-9&lt;/a&gt;). Through Jesus, we come to understand that God seeks to save the lost (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/19/Luke-19-10.html"&gt;Luke 19:10&lt;/a&gt;). He embodies compassion (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/14/Matthew-14-14.html"&gt;Matthew 14:14&lt;/a&gt;), mercy (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/6/Luke-6-36.html"&gt;Luke 6:36&lt;/a&gt;), and forgiveness (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/9/Matthew-9-1.html"&gt;Matthew 9:1-8&lt;/a&gt;). Simultaneously, Jesus revealed that God would judge unrepentant sin (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/13/Luke-13-5.html"&gt;Luke 13:5&lt;/a&gt;) and expressed His anger towards those who lived falsely and refused to acknowledge the truth (Matthew 23).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Above all, Jesus demonstrated that God is love (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-John/4/1-John-4-8.html"&gt;1 John 4:8&lt;/a&gt;). Out of love, God sent His Son into the world (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/3/John-3-16.html"&gt;John 3:16&lt;/a&gt;), who willingly died on the cross for sinners (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/5/Romans-5-8.html"&gt;Romans 5:8&lt;/a&gt;). It is through love that God still calls sinners to repentance and offers the grace to be called children of God (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-John/3/1-John-3-1.html"&gt;1 John 3:1&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding what God is like has significant implications for our lives. Recognizing that God exists and is in control reminds us that we are not alone or without purpose. It also reaffirms our need to acknowledge Him as the ultimate authority in our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Realizing that God is a moral being helps us understand the importance of living according to His standards. It prompts us to seek righteousness and avoid sinful behaviors. Moreover, comprehending that God is love encourages us to embrace His forgiveness, grace, and mercy in our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take a moment to reflect on your understanding of God. How does your perception align with the biblical description presented here? Consider how knowing what God is like can impact your relationship with Him and shape your actions and attitudes towards others.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/The Nature of God/The Basics"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Does God Possess a Soul? Exploring the Divine Essence</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/does-god-have-a-soul/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-05-14T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-05-14T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-05-14:/does-god-have-a-soul/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Does God Have a Soul?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept of a soul is first mentioned in the Bible in the context of the creation of Adam. In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/2/Genesis-2-7.html"&gt;Genesis 2:7&lt;/a&gt;, it states that "the LORD God formed a man from the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Does God Have a Soul?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept of a soul is first mentioned in the Bible in the context of the creation of Adam. In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/2/Genesis-2-7.html"&gt;Genesis 2:7&lt;/a&gt;, it states that "the LORD God formed a man from the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and the man became a living being" (or "a living soul" in the KJV). This shows that humans have a non-physical part known as a soul.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout Scripture, people are referred to as having a soul (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/62/Psalm-62-5.html"&gt;Psalm 62:5&lt;/a&gt;; 104:1; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/1/Luke-1-46.html"&gt;Luke 1:46&lt;/a&gt;). Since humans are created in God's image (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/1/Genesis-1-26.html"&gt;Genesis 1:26&lt;/a&gt;–27), some may wonder if this means that God also has a soul. While there are passages that indicate that God has a soul (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Leviticus/26/Leviticus-26-11.html"&gt;Leviticus 26:11&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Judges/10/Judges-10-16.html"&gt;Judges 10:16&lt;/a&gt;), we must be cautious in interpreting these verses. Scripture often uses anthropomorphism, attributing human qualities to God in a figurative sense. Just as God is described as having hands or a face, it could be that biblical descriptions of God's "soul" are also anthropomorphisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/b8UmAQq6n7A" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is important to note that Scripture does not explicitly state that God has a soul. God is Spirit (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/4/John-4-24.html"&gt;John 4:24&lt;/a&gt;), but nowhere does it say that He is Soul or that He possesses a soul. However, when we consider Jesus, who is fully God and fully man, we can be more certain. In His incarnation, Jesus took on a sinless human nature, which included a truly human soul. In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/26/Matthew-26-38.html"&gt;Matthew 26:38&lt;/a&gt;, during His agony in the Garden of Gethsemane, Jesus said, "My soul is overwhelmed with sorrow to the point of death." This indicates that Jesus had a distinct human soul that experienced emotions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The definition of the word "soul" plays a significant role in this discussion. If we equate the word soul with personhood, then it can be said that God has a soul because He possesses a mind, emotions, and a will. If we define the soul as the ability to express emotions, then God also has a soul. However, in the context of humanity, the word soul is often understood as the immaterial part that connects the spirit and the body. In this sense, God does not have a human-like soul because He is Spirit and not human.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding whether God has a soul or not may seem like a theological curiosity, but it has practical implications. It helps us grasp the nature of God and His relationship with us as His creation. By recognizing that humans have souls created in the image of God, we can better understand our own identity and purpose. Additionally, recognizing Jesus' fully human nature allows us to appreciate the depth of His sacrifice on the cross and His ability to empathize with our human experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does the concept of God having a soul or not impact your understanding of His nature?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What does it mean for you as a believer to have a soul created in the image of God?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reflect on Jesus' humanity and His ability to relate to our experiences. How does this impact your relationship with Him?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, while Scripture does not explicitly state that God has a soul, it does refer to people having souls and describes God using anthropomorphic language. Jesus, being fully God and fully man, possessed a human soul. The definition of "soul" is crucial in understanding this topic, as it affects how we perceive God's nature and our own identity as His creation. Recognizing Jesus' humanity allows us to appreciate His sacrifice and relate to Him on a deeper level.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/The Nature of God/The Basics"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Unveiling the Divine Mystery of the Third Person of the Trinity</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/third-person-of-the-trinity/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-04-29T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-04-29T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-04-29:/third-person-of-the-trinity/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;The Third Person of the Trinity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Trinity is a fundamental concept in Christianity that describes God's nature as three distinct persons in one being: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. While all three members of the Trinity are coexistent, co-eternal, and co-equal, the Holy Spirit is often referred to as …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;The Third Person of the Trinity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Trinity is a fundamental concept in Christianity that describes God's nature as three distinct persons in one being: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. While all three members of the Trinity are coexistent, co-eternal, and co-equal, the Holy Spirit is often referred to as the third person of the Trinity. In this article, we will explore the significance of the Holy Spirit and its role within the Trinity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Revelation of the Holy Spirit&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Holy Spirit is called the third person of the Trinity because, in the progression of revelation, it was the third person to be revealed as an individual person. In the book of Genesis, we see a reference to the Spirit of God hovering over the waters at creation. However, at that time, this reference would have been understood as "the power of God" rather than a specific personality who is God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VM2UE6MIKzM" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is not until Jesus came to earth that we begin to understand the Trinity more fully. Jesus, who is considered the second person of the Trinity, spoke about sending a third person who is God—the Holy Spirit. In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/14/John-14-16.html"&gt;John 14:16&lt;/a&gt;–17 and 16:12–15, Jesus explains that when He leaves the world, He will send another Helper, who is identified as the Holy Spirit. From these words, it becomes clear that the Holy Spirit is not just an impersonal power of God but a distinct person who is fully God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Understanding the Role of the Holy Spirit&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Christians use terms like first, second, and third in relation to the persons of the Trinity, they are not implying that one person is more important than another. Each person of the Trinity is equally significant and fully God. The Athanasian Creed beautifully expresses this by stating that all three persons are coeternal and coequal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, within their interactions with humanity, each person of the Trinity has taken on specific roles. The Holy Spirit, in particular, directs attention to the Son, while the Son directs attention to the Father. This interplay within the Trinity allows us to understand more fully the nature of God and His relationship with humanity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the Holy Spirit as the third person of the Trinity is crucial for Christians because it helps us grasp the fullness of God's nature and His presence in our lives. The Holy Spirit, as a distinct person, plays a vital role in guiding and empowering believers. Recognizing this enables us to cultivate a deeper relationship with God and rely on the Holy Spirit's guidance in our daily lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The concept of the Trinity can be challenging to comprehend fully. How does recognizing the Holy Spirit as a distinct person help you understand God more deeply?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In what ways have you experienced the guidance or empowerment of the Holy Spirit in your life? Take a moment to reflect on these experiences and express gratitude for the Holy Spirit's work in your life.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can you cultivate a greater awareness of the Holy Spirit's presence and guidance in your daily life? Consider setting aside time for prayer and reflection, asking the Holy Spirit to reveal Himself more fully to you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, the Holy Spirit is recognized as the third person of the Trinity. While all three persons are equal and fully God, understanding the distinct role of the Holy Spirit allows us to comprehend more fully God's nature and His interaction with humanity. As Christians, we can cultivate a deeper relationship with God by acknowledging and relying on the guidance and empowerment of the Holy Spirit in our lives.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/The Nature of God/The Trinity"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Divine Acts: Unveiling God's Purpose in Our Lives</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/god-doing/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-04-28T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-04-28T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-04-28:/god-doing/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;God's Activities Before Creation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our human minds struggle to comprehend the existence of God before the creation of the universe. However, the Bible provides some insight into what God was doing during this time. It reveals that before time began, God existed in three Persons: the Father, the Son (Jesus Christ), and the Holy Spirit. In this article, we will explore what God was doing before creation and how this information impacts our understanding of Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1. The Trinity in Eternity Past&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before the universe came into existence, God existed in perfect harmony and flawlessness as the Trinity. The Father, Son, and Holy Spirit were together in fellowship with one another from all eternity. They loved each other deeply and experienced complete joy. Just as David stated in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalms/16/Psalms-16-11.html"&gt;Psalms 16:11&lt;/a&gt;, being in the presence of God carries an overwhelming sense of joy, fulfillment, and pleasure. Therefore, God dwelt joyfully alone in eternity as the Trinity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Understanding that God exists eternally as a loving relationship between three distinct Persons helps us grasp the depth of His love and fellowship. It highlights His self-sufficiency and fulfillment within Himself and encourages us to seek a similar relationship with Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; Reflect on the idea that God did not create us out of necessity but out of overflow from His own joy and love. How does this impact your understanding of His desire for relationship with you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2. The Preincarnate Christ&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/1/John-1-1.html"&gt;John 1:1&lt;/a&gt; tells us that Jesus also existed before creation: “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.” The preincarnate Christ was intimately united with the Father and partook of His glory. In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/17/John-17-5.html"&gt;John 17:5&lt;/a&gt;, Jesus Himself explains that He had glory with the Father before the world existed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Recognizing that Jesus, as the preincarnate Christ, existed alongside the Father before creation emphasizes His eternal nature and His role in the plan of redemption. It deepens our understanding of His sacrifice on the cross and strengthens our faith in Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; Consider the profound love and humility displayed by Jesus in willingly leaving His glory behind to become human and offer Himself as a sacrifice for our sins. How does this inspire you to live out your faith?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QPywCD-TSd0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;3. The Holy Spirit's Presence&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Holy Spirit was present before the creation of the universe. &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/1/Genesis-1-2.html"&gt;Genesis 1:2&lt;/a&gt; describes the Spirit as "hovering over the face" of the dark and formless earth. This presence indicates that the Holy Spirit played a role in the work of creation, bringing order out of chaos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Understanding that the Holy Spirit was present from the beginning emphasizes His active involvement in the work of God. It reminds us of His ongoing work in our lives today, empowering and guiding us as believers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; Consider how the presence of the Holy Spirit in your life brings order, peace, and guidance. How can you rely more on His power and leading?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;4. God's Complete Joy and Fulfillment&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before creating the universe, God experienced absolute satisfaction in Himself. As a loving Trinity, God found complete joy and fulfillment in beholding and communing with Himself. He possessed perfect knowledge of Himself and dwelt in eternal, complete joy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Recognizing God's self-sufficiency challenges our tendency to seek fulfillment in worldly pursuits or relationships. It encourages us to find our ultimate satisfaction in Him rather than relying on external circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; Reflect on times when you have sought fulfillment outside of your relationship with God. How can you shift your focus back to finding true joy and fulfillment in Him alone?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;5. Mystery Surrounding God's Activities&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the Bible provides some insight into what God was doing before creation, much remains a mystery. We know that at some point, the Trinity discussed the redemption of mankind. However, the specific details and timing of these discussions are not revealed to us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Embracing the mystery surrounding God's activities before creation humbles us, reminding us that our finite minds cannot fully comprehend the infinite God. It encourages us to trust in His wisdom and sovereignty even when we don't have all the answers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; Consider how your faith can grow when you trust in God's wisdom and embrace the mysteries of His ways. How can you cultivate a deeper sense of awe and wonder in your relationship with Him?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before the universe was created, God existed eternally as the Trinity. The Father, Son, and Holy Spirit experienced perfect joy and fulfillment within their loving relationship. Jesus, as the preincarnate Christ, shared in this glory and existed alongside the Father from eternity past. The Holy Spirit played an active role in creation. While much about God's activities before creation remains a mystery, embracing this mystery deepens our faith and encourages us to find our ultimate satisfaction in Him alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we contemplate what God was doing before creation, may we be filled with awe and wonder at His eternal nature and perfect love. May we seek to know Him more deeply and find our true joy and fulfillment in Him.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/The Nature of God/Time and Place"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Unveiling the Divine Mystery: Understanding Tritheism and the Holy Trinity</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/tritheism-trinity/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-04-26T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-04-26T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-04-26:/tritheism-trinity/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Tritheism and the Trinity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The doctrine of the Trinity is a central belief in Christianity. It affirms that God is one in being while existing as three co-equal, co-eternal Persons: God the Father, God the Son (Jesus Christ), and God the Holy Spirit. Some people argue that the doctrine of …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Tritheism and the Trinity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The doctrine of the Trinity is a central belief in Christianity. It affirms that God is one in being while existing as three co-equal, co-eternal Persons: God the Father, God the Son (Jesus Christ), and God the Holy Spirit. Some people argue that the doctrine of the Trinity logically leads to tritheism, which is the belief in three separate gods. However, this criticism is not valid. The early Christians upheld the monotheism of the Old Testament while affirming the full deity of three distinct Persons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Point 1: Monotheism in the Bible&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bible clearly teaches that there is only one God. Verses such as &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/43/Isaiah-43-10.html"&gt;Isaiah 43:10&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-Corinthians/8/1-Corinthians-8-4.html"&gt;1 Corinthians 8:4&lt;/a&gt; affirm monotheism. The Old Testament also emphasizes the deity of God the Father, with passages like &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/6/John-6-27.html"&gt;John 6:27&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/1/Romans-1-7.html"&gt;Romans 1:7&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-Peter/1/1-Peter-1-2.html"&gt;1 Peter 1:2&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Understanding that monotheism is a foundational belief in Christianity helps us grasp the significance of the Trinity. Even though there are three divine Persons, they are united as one God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; Consider how monotheism influences your understanding of God's nature and character.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Point 2: Deity of Jesus and the Holy Spirit&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bible not only affirms the deity of God the Father but also of Jesus Christ and the Holy Spirit. Verses like &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/1/John-1-1.html"&gt;John 1:1-3&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/1/Hebrews-1-2.html"&gt;Hebrews 1:2&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Titus/2/Titus-2-13.html"&gt;Titus 2:13&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Colossians/1/Colossians-1-16.html"&gt;Colossians 1:16-17&lt;/a&gt; establish Jesus' divine nature. The Holy Spirit's deity is supported by &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Acts/5/Acts-5-3.html"&gt;Acts 5:3-4&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-Corinthians/3/1-Corinthians-3-16.html"&gt;1 Corinthians 3:16&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Recognizing that Jesus and the Holy Spirit are fully divine helps us understand their role in salvation and their significance in the Christian faith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; Reflect on how your understanding of Jesus and the Holy Spirit impacts your relationship with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Point 3: Distinct Persons&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VM2UE6MIKzM" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biblical writers go out of their way to emphasize that the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are distinct from each other. &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/28/Matthew-28-19.html"&gt;Matthew 28:19&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/15/Romans-15-30.html"&gt;Romans 15:30&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/2-Corinthians/13/2-Corinthians-13-14.html"&gt;2 Corinthians 13:14&lt;/a&gt; are examples of passages that highlight this distinction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Understanding the distinction between the three Persons of the Trinity helps us appreciate their unique roles and interactions within the Godhead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; Consider how recognizing the distinctiveness of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit impacts your understanding of their relationships with one another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Point 4: Personhood in the Trinity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we speak of personhood in the context of the Trinity, we are describing self-distinctions within God. Each Person possesses a center of self-consciousness and has attributes of deity. The three divine Persons can communicate with each other (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/17/John-17-1.html"&gt;John 17:1-26&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/1/Hebrews-1-8.html"&gt;Hebrews 1:8-9&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Recognizing the personhood within the Trinity helps us understand how God can be both one and three simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; Consider how understanding personhood within the Trinity deepens your appreciation for the complexity of God's nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Point 5: One Being, Three Persons&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there are three distinct divine Persons in the Trinity, they do not represent three separate gods. The same Scriptures that affirm the divinity of all three Persons also unequivocally affirm monotheism (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Deuteronomy/6/Deuteronomy-6-4.html"&gt;Deuteronomy 6:4&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-Timothy/2/1-Timothy-2-5.html"&gt;1 Timothy 2:5&lt;/a&gt;). The triune God possesses one indivisible essence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Understanding that God is one Being but three Persons helps us maintain monotheism while appreciating the complexity and unity within the Trinity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; Reflect on how the unity of God impacts your understanding of His nature and the implications it has for your faith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Point 6: Concept vs. Word&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the word "Trinity" is not found in the Bible, the concept of the Trinity is clearly present. The early Christians used this concept to describe the relationship between the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Recognizing that the word "Trinity" may not be explicitly stated in Scripture helps us understand that theological concepts are often used to describe biblical truths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; Consider how the use of theological concepts can aid our understanding and communication of biblical truths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, the doctrine of the Trinity is a complex but essential belief in Christianity. It upholds monotheism while affirming the full deity of God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit. Understanding the distinction between the three Persons and their unity within one Being deepens our appreciation for God's nature and character. While the word "Trinity" may not be explicitly mentioned in Scripture, its concept is clearly present and helps us articulate this foundational belief.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/The Nature of God/The Trinity"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Discovering the True Nature of God: A Comprehensive Guide for Christian Believers</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/what-is-god/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-04-26T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-04-26T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-04-26:/what-is-god/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;What is God?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Points:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;God's nature is beyond human comprehension.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;God revealed Himself as "I AM WHO I AM."&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;God is a self-existent and necessary being.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;God is personal and has a purpose.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;God is a Triune being.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;God is love.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A. W. Tozer rightly pointed …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;What is God?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Points:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;God's nature is beyond human comprehension.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;God revealed Himself as "I AM WHO I AM."&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;God is a self-existent and necessary being.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;God is personal and has a purpose.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;God is a Triune being.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;God is love.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;God's Incomprehensible Nature&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A. W. Tozer rightly pointed out that we cannot fully comprehend what God is like in Himself. The book of Job asks, "Can you discover the depths of God? Can you discover the limits of the Almighty?" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Job/11/Job-11-7.html"&gt;Job 11:7-8&lt;/a&gt;). However, while we cannot fully comprehend God's essence, He has revealed aspects of Himself that we can understand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;"I AM WHO I AM"&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Moses asked God what His name was, God replied, "I AM WHO I AM" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Exodus/3/Exodus-3-14.html"&gt;Exodus 3:14&lt;/a&gt;). This name signifies that God is pure existence or pure actuality. He is the only one who can say, "I be that I be." While many things have existence, only God is Being itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Self-Existence and First Cause&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QPywCD-TSd0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;God is a self-existent being and the first cause of everything else that exists. He has life in Himself (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/5/John-5-26.html"&gt;John 5:26&lt;/a&gt;) and does not depend on anything or anyone else for His existence (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Acts/17/Acts-17-25.html"&gt;Acts 17:25&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Necessary Being&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God is a necessary being, meaning His nonexistence is impossible. All other things are contingent beings, meaning they could not exist without Him. If God did not exist, nothing else would exist either (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Job/34/Job-34-14.html"&gt;Job 34:14-15&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Personal and Purposeful&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God is a personal being with intent and will. He has a purpose, creates, and directs events according to His plan (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/46/Isaiah-46-9.html"&gt;Isaiah 46:9-10&lt;/a&gt;). While the word "personal" doesn't refer to personality traits, it emphasizes that God has intentions and acts purposefully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Triune Nature of God&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bible affirms that there is only one God (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Deuteronomy/6/Deuteronomy-6-4.html"&gt;Deuteronomy 6:4&lt;/a&gt;), but it also reveals a plurality within the Godhead. Jesus commanded His disciples to baptize in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/28/Matthew-28-19.html"&gt;Matthew 28:19&lt;/a&gt;). This indicates a unity and diversity within the Godhead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout Scripture, the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are referred to as God. Jesus is described as the first cause of everything and possessing self-existence (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/1/John-1-3.html"&gt;John 1:3-4&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Colossians/1/Colossians-1-17.html"&gt;Colossians 1:17&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;God is Love&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/4/John-4-8.html"&gt;John 4:8&lt;/a&gt; simply states, "God is love." While many things can possess and experience love, only God is love itself. This aspect of God's nature is fundamental to understanding His character and His relationship with humanity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding what God is like helps us develop a more accurate view of Him and deepens our relationship with Him. Recognizing His self-existence and necessary being helps us grasp His sovereignty and understand that He is the ultimate source of all life. Knowing that God is personal and purposeful assures us that He has intentions for our lives and directs events according to His plan. Recognizing the triune nature of God helps us comprehend how He can be both one and yet exist in a relational community. Understanding that God is love allows us to experience His love more fully and reflect that love in our relationships with others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Think About It&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does understanding God's nature as self-existent and necessary impact your view of His sovereignty?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In what ways does recognizing God as personal and purposeful affect your understanding of His involvement in your life?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does contemplating the triune nature of God deepen your appreciation for the complexity and unity within the Godhead?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reflect on the statement "God is love." How does this reality impact your understanding of His character and His love for you?&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The concept of subordination within the Trinity may seem confusing at first. After all, Jesus and the Father are described as being "one" in the Bible (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/10/John-10-30.html"&gt;John 10:30&lt;/a&gt;).

&lt;p&gt;The concept of subordination within the Trinity may seem confusing at first. After all, Jesus and the Father are described as being "one" in the Bible (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/10/John-10-30.html"&gt;John 10:30&lt;/a&gt;). However, it is important to understand that there are different types of subordination when discussing the triune nature of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Equal in Nature&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First and foremost, it is crucial to recognize that all three Persons of the Trinity—God the Father, Jesus the Son, and the Holy Spirit—are equal in nature. They share the same divine attributes and possess the same divine nature. This means that there is no difference in essence between them. The Trinity is not composed of greater and lesser gods; rather, there is one God existing eternally in three co-equal Persons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Economic Subordination&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VM2UE6MIKzM" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While there is no ontological subordination (difference in essence) within the Trinity, there is what theologians refer to as economic (or relational) subordination. This form of subordination refers to the roles or activities that each Person of the Trinity voluntarily submits to in relation to creation and salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, we see in Scripture that the Father sent the Son into the world (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-John/4/1-John-4-10.html"&gt;1 John 4:10&lt;/a&gt;). This sending does not imply a lower rank or subservient position but highlights the distinct role that each Person plays. The Son willingly submits to this role in obedience to the Father. Similarly, Jesus perfectly submitted His will to the Father's will (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/22/Luke-22-42.html"&gt;Luke 22:42&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/10/Hebrews-10-7.html"&gt;Hebrews 10:7&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Holy Spirit is also sent by Jesus and "proceeds from the Father" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/14/John-14-26.html"&gt;John 14:26&lt;/a&gt;; 15:26). The Spirit testifies of Christ and His work. These roles are never reversed or interchangeable. Each Person of the Trinity has specific responsibilities within creation and salvation, highlighting their relational subordination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;An Analogy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To better understand this concept of economic subordination, we can consider an analogy. Imagine a team of three individuals working together on a project. Each member has a unique role to play in achieving the project's goals. While they are all equal in value and importance, each person has different responsibilities and tasks. In this analogy, the team members voluntarily submit to one another's roles for the successful completion of the project. Similarly, within the Trinity, each Person voluntarily submits to one another's roles for the fulfillment of God's purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the concept of subordination within the Trinity is essential for several reasons. Firstly, it helps us grasp the nature of God more fully. While He is one God, He exists eternally in three Persons who are equal in essence yet distinct in their roles. This understanding enriches our knowledge of who God is and how He relates to us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, it safeguards against heretical views that suggest a hierarchy or inequality within the Trinity. The orthodox Christian view affirms that all three Persons are fully God and equal in nature. They are not separate gods or lesser beings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, comprehending subordination within the Trinity sheds light on our own lives as followers of Christ. It reminds us of the importance of submission and obedience to God's will. Just as Jesus submitted Himself to the Father's will, we are called to submit ourselves to God's plan and purpose for our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does understanding subordination within the Trinity deepen your appreciation for God's love and work in your life?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consider how the concept of submission within the Trinity can influence your relationships with others. How can you emulate Christ's submission in your interactions with others?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reflect on the implications of subordination within the Trinity for your understanding of God's sovereignty and plan for redemption.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary, while there is no ontological subordination within the Trinity, there is an economic or relational subordination. This means that each Person of the Trinity voluntarily submits to specific roles and responsibilities for the purposes of creation and salvation. It is crucial to recognize that all three Persons are equal in nature, sharing the same divine attributes. Understanding this concept helps us appreciate the nature of God more fully and encourages us to emulate Christ's submission in our own lives.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/The Nature of God/The Trinity"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Is God a Person: Exploring the Divine Nature in Christianity</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/is-god-a-person/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-04-10T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-04-10T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-04-10:/is-god-a-person/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Is God a Person?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, God is a person, but it's important to understand that when we say "person," we don't mean that God is a human being. Instead, we mean that God possesses a personality and is a rational being with self-awareness. The Bible teaches that God exists in …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Is God a Person?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, God is a person, but it's important to understand that when we say "person," we don't mean that God is a human being. Instead, we mean that God possesses a personality and is a rational being with self-awareness. The Bible teaches that God exists in three Persons: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Nature of God as a Person&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we talk about God being a person, we are referring to an individual being with a mind, emotions, and a will. Just like humans, God has intellect, emotions, and volition. For example, the Bible tells us that God has intellect by stating that His thoughts are vast and incomprehensible (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/139/Psalm-139-17.html"&gt;Psalm 139:17&lt;/a&gt;). It also describes His emotions, such as anger (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/78/Psalm-78-41.html"&gt;Psalm 78:41&lt;/a&gt;), and His will, which is evident in His commandments and instructions (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-Corinthians/1/1-Corinthians-1-1.html"&gt;1 Corinthians 1:1&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Tri-Unity of God&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept of the tri-unity of God can be challenging to grasp, but it is supported by biblical evidence. In various passages of the Bible, we see references to the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit as distinct Persons in the Trinity. For instance, &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/48/Isaiah-48-16.html"&gt;Isaiah 48:16&lt;/a&gt; and 61:1 depict the Son speaking while making reference to the Father and the Holy Spirit. In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/4/Luke-4-14.html"&gt;Luke 4:14&lt;/a&gt;–19, Jesus also refers to Himself as anointed by the Holy Spirit. Additionally, &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/3/Matthew-3-16.html"&gt;Matthew 3:16&lt;/a&gt;–17 describes Jesus' baptism where God the Holy Spirit descends on God the Son while the Father proclaims His pleasure in the Son. Other verses like &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/28/Matthew-28-19.html"&gt;Matthew 28:19&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/2-Corinthians/13/2-Corinthians-13-14.html"&gt;2 Corinthians 13:14&lt;/a&gt; further emphasize the existence of three distinct Persons in the Trinity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ITEzXLcpKZs" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The Personhood of Each Member of the Trinity&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each person of the Trinity—Father, Son, and Holy Spirit—exhibits personal characteristics. God the Father possesses a mind, emotions, and a will. His thoughts and ways are higher than ours (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/55/Isaiah-55-8.html"&gt;Isaiah 55:8&lt;/a&gt;–9). He experiences emotions like compassion (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/78/Psalm-78-40.html"&gt;Psalm 78:40&lt;/a&gt;) and has a will that is expressed through His commandments and plans (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-Peter/2/1-Peter-2-15.html"&gt;1 Peter 2:15&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, God the Son, Jesus Christ, is also a person. He has a mind, emotions, and a will. During His earthly life, Jesus grew in wisdom and knowledge (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/2/Luke-2-52.html"&gt;Luke 2:52&lt;/a&gt;), experienced emotions like sadness (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/11/John-11-35.html"&gt;John 11:35&lt;/a&gt;), and expressed His will when He prayed to the Father (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/22/Luke-22-42.html"&gt;Luke 22:42&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God the Holy Spirit is also a person with a mind, emotions, and a will. The Holy Spirit intercedes for believers according to God's will (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/8/Romans-8-27.html"&gt;Romans 8:27&lt;/a&gt;), can be grieved by our actions (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Ephesians/4/Ephesians-4-30.html"&gt;Ephesians 4:30&lt;/a&gt;), and has a will that can be resisted (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Galatians/5/Galatians-5-17.html"&gt;Galatians 5:17&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;God's Personal Nature&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God's personal nature is evident in the way He interacts with humanity. Throughout the Bible, we find numerous examples of God expressing anger, laughter, compassion, love, hatred, teaching, reproving, and leading. All of these actions imply that God is indeed a person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding that God is a person with personality helps us relate to Him on a deeper level. It reminds us that we have been created in His image and that we can develop a personal relationship with Him. Recognizing God's personhood also helps us appreciate His attributes and character more fully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Think About It&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider how different your perception of God would be if you didn't view Him as a person. How does recognizing God's personhood impact your understanding of His love, care, and involvement in your life? Take a moment to reflect on the personal nature of God and how it affects your relationship with Him.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/The Nature of God/The Basics"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Unveiling God's Time: Understanding Divine Timing for Christian Believers</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/god-time/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-04-08T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-04-08T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-04-08:/god-time/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;God and Time&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We live in a physical world with four known dimensions: length, width, height, and time. However, God exists in a different realm—the spirit realm—beyond our physical perception. While God is real, He is not limited by the physical laws and dimensions that govern our world …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;God and Time&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We live in a physical world with four known dimensions: length, width, height, and time. However, God exists in a different realm—the spirit realm—beyond our physical perception. While God is real, He is not limited by the physical laws and dimensions that govern our world (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/57/Isaiah-57-15.html"&gt;Isaiah 57:15&lt;/a&gt;). So, what is God's relationship to time?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;God's Timelessness&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/90/Psalm-90-4.html"&gt;Psalm 90:4&lt;/a&gt;, Moses used an analogy to describe the timelessness of God: "For a thousand years in Your sight are like a day that has just gone by, or like a watch in the night." This contrast between the eternity of God and the temporality of man highlights that our lives are short and frail, while God remains unchanging and timeless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From God's perspective, time is irrelevant because He transcends it. In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/2-Peter/3/2-Peter-3-8.html"&gt;2 Peter 3:8&lt;/a&gt;, Peter reminds his readers that God's perspective on time is vastly different from ours. The passing of time on Earth is inconsequential to God's timeless perspective. A second is no different from an eon; a billion years pass like seconds to the eternal God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to note that we, as finite beings, cannot fully comprehend the concept of eternity or the timelessness of God. We can only grasp it in part and describe Him as a God without a beginning or end—eternal, infinite, and everlasting (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/90/Psalm-90-2.html"&gt;Psalm 90:2&lt;/a&gt;). To put it simply, time is a measure of duration and change. Our clocks mark change, indicating the passage of time. However, for God, who does not change, time has no meaning or relation to Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Beginning of Time&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The science of physics tells us that time is a property resulting from the existence of matter. Time exists when matter exists. However, God is not matter; He created matter. Therefore, time began when God created the universe. Before that, God simply existed without the existence of matter, and time had no meaning or relation to Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eternity is a term used to express the concept of something that has no end or beginning. While God has no beginning or end, He cannot be wholly defined by eternity as a measure of time. Eternity is one of God’s attributes, but He is greater than time and exists outside of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vf1jy0nCHnA" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scripture reveals that God lives outside the bounds of time as we know it. Our destiny was planned "before the beginning of time" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/2-Timothy/1/2-Timothy-1-9.html"&gt;2 Timothy 1:9&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Titus/1/Titus-1-2.html"&gt;Titus 1:2&lt;/a&gt;) and "before the creation of the world" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Ephesians/1/Ephesians-1-4.html"&gt;Ephesians 1:4&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-Peter/1/1-Peter-1-20.html"&gt;1 Peter 1:20&lt;/a&gt;). The physical universe we experience was created by God from a source independent of the physical dimensions we can perceive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Timeless God&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While God is timeless, it is important to note that He is in time with us right now. He is not unreachably transcendent but present in this very moment. This understanding brings comfort to believers, knowing that God can respond to our needs and prayers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding God's relationship to time helps us grasp His eternal nature and transcendent power. It reminds us that God is not confined by the limitations and constraints of our physical world but exists beyond them. This knowledge deepens our awe and reverence for Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Think About It&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take a moment to reflect on the concept of eternity and the timelessness of God. How does this understanding impact your perception of His power and presence in your life? Consider how knowing that God transcends time can bring comfort and hope in times of difficulty or uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/The Nature of God/Time and Place"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Divine Omniscience: Unveiling God's Infinite Knowledge for Believers</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/god-omniscient/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-04-05T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-04-05T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-04-05:/god-omniscient/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;God's Omniscience&lt;/h2&gt;

This means that He has complete knowledge and understanding of all things. His omniscience is not limited to any one person in the Godhead …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;God's Omniscience&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Omniscience is the state of having total knowledge, the quality of knowing everything. In the Christian faith, it is believed that God is omniscient. This means that He has complete knowledge and understanding of all things. His omniscience is not limited to any one person in the Godhead—Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are all by nature omniscient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What Does God Know?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God's omniscience extends to every aspect of His creation. He knows not only the smallest details of our lives but also everything that happens around us. He even knows when a sparrow falls or when we lose a single hair. Nothing escapes His knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, God's knowledge encompasses not only the present but also the past and future. He knows what will occur until the end of history itself. His knowledge is not limited by time or space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The New Testament Perspective&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the New Testament, Jesus' omniscience is evident. In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Acts/1/Acts-1-24.html"&gt;Acts 1:24&lt;/a&gt;, the apostles pray, "Lord, you know everyone's heart," implying Jesus' omniscience. This is necessary for Him to be able to receive petitions and intercede at God's right hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During His earthly ministry, Jesus demonstrated His omniscience by knowing people's thoughts and details about their lives before even meeting them. For example, He knew about the woman at the well's marital history and also informed His disciples about the death of Lazarus while being physically distant from him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Paradox of Jesus' Omniscience&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Jesus demonstrated omniscience on earth, there are instances where He asked questions that imply a lack of knowledge. However, these questions were often for the benefit of His audience rather than Himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's important to note that Jesus took on human nature and experienced limitations as a man. He "grew in wisdom and stature" and learned obedience through suffering. This controlled lack of knowledge, such as not knowing when the world would end, can be seen as an act of humility in order to fully share in our human nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Significance of God's Omniscience&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God's omniscience has significant implications for our faith and relationship with Him. We can find security in knowing that there is nothing too hard for an omniscient God. He has known us from eternity, even before creation. He foresaw our sin and yet, in His love, drew us to Himself through Jesus Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our knowledge of God will never be complete, but we can rest in the assurance that He promises never to fail us as long as we continue in Him. Our wonder, love, and praise for Him will continue to grow as we bask in the rays of His heavenly love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iWkM-s28kiM" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Understanding God's omniscience helps us develop a deep trust in Him. Knowing that God has complete knowledge and understanding of everything brings comfort and reassurance. It also reminds us of His sovereignty and power over all things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recognizing God's omniscience challenges us to surrender to His wisdom and guidance. When we acknowledge that God knows better than we do, we can trust His plans for our lives even when they don't align with our own desires or understanding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowing that God is all-knowing also encourages us to approach Him with honesty and openness. We can confidently bring our thoughts, concerns, and desires before Him, knowing that He already knows them and desires an intimate relationship with us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Think About It&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How does the concept of God's omniscience impact your view of His sovereignty and control over your life?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In what ways can understanding God's omniscience deepen your trust and reliance on Him?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How does recognizing God's omniscience change the way you approach prayer and seek guidance from Him?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reflect on the comfort and reassurance that comes from knowing that God sees and understands every aspect of your life, even the smallest details.&lt;/p&gt;

All of God's attributes, such as holiness, love, and wisdom, are infinite and perfect …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;God: Unlimited and Unmeasurable&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Christian faith, God is often described as unlimited and unmeasurable. This means that God is free from all limitations and cannot be confined or restricted by anything in the universe. All of God's attributes, such as holiness, love, and wisdom, are infinite and perfect. It's important to note that when we say something is "unmeasurable," it doesn't necessarily mean it is infinite or unlimited in the same way that God is. The concept of being unmeasurable or unlimited is subject to the limitations of the measurer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a logical perspective, there has to be a single "First Cause" that is necessary for everything else to exist. Rather than making God impossible, logic actually makes Him necessary. God is not just a part of reality; He is reality itself. While there are things in existence that are not God, He is still the ultimate source and foundation of their existence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's also worth mentioning that infinity, when it comes to God, is not a property that can be present in some attributes but not others. One must either be entirely infinite or not infinite at all. For example, to be omnipotent (having all power), one must also be omniscient (having all knowledge) and omnipresent (being present everywhere). All of God's attributes come from the same source - He is the one and only ultimate and necessary being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We break down God's attributes into different categories like omnipotence, omniscience, eternality, etc., to make it easier for our finite minds to comprehend Him. However, in reality, all of these attributes stem from the fact that God is the source of everything else. He simply is - as expressed in His own words when He called Himself "I AM."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qSdRDurOhHE" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's important to note that while God is infinite and unlimited, other beings cannot be truly infinite in the same sense as God. Everything that exists apart from God is a result of His creative work, and every created thing must be fundamentally different from God. Therefore, it is impossible for beings to be truly infinite like God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God is not just an impersonal force or energy; He is a personal being who describes Himself as such in the Bible. This is why our reality operates the way it does. We can't expect to see communication, unity, and relationship in the created world if those properties were not present in the First Cause. In God's nature, we see the Trinity, which embodies communication, unity, and relationship. Without these properties in the First Cause, we would never witness them in the creation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the unlimited and unmeasurable nature of God has significant implications for our faith. It reminds us that God is above and beyond anything we can comprehend or measure. It humbles us and encourages us to approach Him with reverence and awe. Recognizing God's infinitude also helps us grasp His power, wisdom, and love more fully, knowing that they are limitless and perfect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This understanding also helps us differentiate between God and everything else in creation. While there are aspects of creation that reflect God's attributes to some extent, they are not on the same level as God Himself. This prevents us from idolizing or worshiping created things and directs our focus solely on the Creator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does the concept of God being unlimited and unmeasurable impact your understanding of His attributes?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In what ways does recognizing God's infinitude affect your perspective on the created world?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does understanding that God is a personal being impact your relationship with Him?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consider how recognizing God's infinitude might shape your approach to worshiping Him.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reflect on how the concept of an infinite and unlimited God offers comfort and assurance in times of difficulty or uncertainty.&lt;/li&gt;

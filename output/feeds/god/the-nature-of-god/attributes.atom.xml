&lt;p&gt;The concept of omnificence refers to the ability to create all things, possessing unlimited power to bring forth existence. In the Bible, the first verse of Genesis affirms God's omnificence: "In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth." This divine …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;God's Omnificence: The Power to Create All Things&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept of omnificence refers to the ability to create all things, possessing unlimited power to bring forth existence. In the Bible, the first verse of Genesis affirms God's omnificence: "In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth." This divine attribute is also emphasized in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Colossians/1/Colossians-1-15.html"&gt;Colossians 1:15&lt;/a&gt;–17, which speaks of Jesus, the second Person of the Trinity, as the image of the invisible God and affirms that all things were created through Him and for Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God's omnificence stems from His omnipotence, which denotes His infinite power. Scripture attests that God is stronger and more powerful than any created being or object. &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Job/37/Job-37-23.html"&gt;Job 37:23&lt;/a&gt; states, "The Almighty is beyond our reach and exalted in power; in his justice and great righteousness, he does not oppress." In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Jeremiah/32/Jeremiah-32-17.html"&gt;Jeremiah 32:17&lt;/a&gt;, it is acknowledged that God made the heavens and the earth by His great power and outstretched arm, with nothing being too hard for Him. Thus, God possesses the power to do all things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another attribute closely related to God's omnificence is His omniscience, which characterizes Him as infinite in knowledge. In the act of creation, God's omniscience worked hand in hand with His omnificence. &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Proverbs/3/Proverbs-3-19.html"&gt;Proverbs 3:19&lt;/a&gt; reveals that by wisdom the Lord laid the earth's foundations and by understanding He set the heavens in place. Being omnificent, having created all things, naturally equips God with comprehensive knowledge. First &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/3/John-3-20.html"&gt;John 3:20&lt;/a&gt; asserts that God is greater than our hearts and knows all things. &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/46/Isaiah-46-10.html"&gt;Isaiah 46:10&lt;/a&gt; further elucidates that God knows the future as well as the past, making known the end from the beginning. Even our thoughts are known to Him before they are formed: "Before a word is on my tongue you, LORD, know it completely" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/139/Psalm-139-4.html"&gt;Psalm 139:4&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bible unveils numerous other attributes of God, many of which find expression in His creative work. &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/1/Romans-1-20.html"&gt;Romans 1:20&lt;/a&gt; affirms that since the creation of the world, God's invisible qualities—His eternal power and divine nature—have been clearly seen and understood through what has been made. Psalm 104 is a psalm replete with praise for our omnificent God. It marvels at the multitude of His works and acknowledges the wisdom displayed in their creation. The psalm extols the creation of light, clouds, wind, seas, mountains, valleys, beasts of the field, birds of the sky, trees, sun and moon, and the very rhythm of life. All these serve as testaments to God's omnificence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NjZPqX5Gdns" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/40/Psalm-40-5.html"&gt;Psalm 40:5&lt;/a&gt; contemplates the depth of God's omnificence and acknowledges that His wonders are too numerous to declare: "Many, LORD my God, are the wonders you have done. . . . None can compare with you; were I to speak and tell of your deeds, they would be too many to declare." God's creative power is limitless and surpasses our ability to fully comprehend. He is our omnificent Creator, Sustainer, and the sole source of eternal life. &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Acts/17/Acts-17-28.html"&gt;Acts 17:28&lt;/a&gt; encapsulates this truth by stating that in Him we live, move, and have our being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding God's omnificence is vital because it reminds us of His unmatched power and authority over all creation. Recognizing that everything around us is a product of His divine creativity deepens our appreciation for His greatness. Moreover, comprehending God's omniscience reveals His intimate knowledge of us and His meticulous involvement in our lives. This understanding fosters a sense of awe and reverence towards our Creator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reflect on the complexity and diversity of creation. How does the reality of God's omnificence impact your perception of His creative work?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consider the implications of God's omniscience for your life. How does knowing that God knows you completely and is involved in every aspect of your existence affect your relationship with Him?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Meditate on the fact that God's power and knowledge are far beyond human comprehension. How does this deepen your trust in Him and His plans for your life?&lt;/li&gt;

Exploring Divine Autonomy in Christianity</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/does-god-have-free-will/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-08-19T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-08-19T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-08-19:/does-god-have-free-will/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Does God Have Free Will?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To understand whether God has free will, we first need to define what we mean by "free will." For the purpose of this discussion, we will define free will as "the capacity of a conscious mind to make decisions and choices without any external constraints or coercion."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on this definition, we can say that God certainly possesses free will. God has a mind, is conscious, and has the capacity to make decisions and choices. He does not answer to any authority, is not limited by any external constraints, and cannot be coerced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God created human beings with a form of free will as well. It is part of what distinguishes us from rocks and animals. However, the volition we possess is of a lesser sort than God's. Unlike humans, God has completely free will in the sense that He is not limited by anything apart from Himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Limited Free Will for Humans&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Human beings have a certain aspect of decision-making that is unconstrained by natural laws. Many events in the world are determined by natural laws, such as objects falling due to gravity or animals following their instincts. However, our choices in matters like what shoes to wear or what breakfast to order are not governed by these natural laws.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While humans have a limited autonomy within the natural world, there are always limitations on our choices. We cannot choose to do things that are physically impossible, like flapping our arms and flying to the moon. Therefore, human beings have a form of free will that is constrained by external factors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;God's Unconstrained Free Will&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast to humans, God's free will is unconstrained in every aspect. The natural world operates subsidiary to His realm. He is not bound by natural laws; in fact, He established those laws and is sovereign over them. God could have created the universe in any number of ways, but the way it exists is due to His choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even the act of creation itself was the result of God's free will. His choice to create was not influenced by any necessity or obligation. God's volition is absolute; His actions are neither deterministically constrained nor controlled by someone else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Fed9hwmJNSE" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;God's Intrinsic Nature and Limitations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While God has complete free will, there are certain things that He is incapable of doing because of His perfect and holy nature. For example, &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Titus/1/Titus-1-2.html"&gt;Titus 1:2&lt;/a&gt; states that God "cannot lie." This limitation does not suggest any external control but rather identifies an intrinsic property of God's own character. God cannot be unfaithful to Himself, break His Word, or be less than perfect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, there are certain things that God is incapable of doing because of the very nature of reality. For instance, He cannot make a triangular square. These statements reflect the fact that God does not deal in absurdities or fallacies but operates within the bounds of reality that He established.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God's inability to lie or sin or engage in illogical actions does not diminish His freedom in any way. Instead, it is a result of His own intrinsic nature. External influences have no hold on Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding whether God has free will has important implications for our understanding of His nature and sovereignty. Recognizing that God possesses free will helps us grasp His absolute authority and control over all things. It highlights the fact that He is not subject to external constraints or limitations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, acknowledging our own limited free will humbles us before God and reminds us of our dependence on Him. It reinforces the truth that we are creatures created by God and subject to His authority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Think About It&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reflect on the concept of free will as defined in this article. How does this definition align with your understanding of free will?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider the limitations on human free will discussed in this article. How do these limitations affect your perspective on the choices you make?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does it mean for God to have complete free will? How does this understanding impact your view of God's sovereignty and authority?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reflect on the idea that God's inability to lie or sin is a result of His perfect and holy nature. How does this reinforce your trust in His character?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can a deeper understanding of God's free will and our limited free will impact how we approach decision-making and submit to God's authority in our lives?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Christianity, one of the attributes ascribed to God is omnipotence, which means having all power. This concept is derived from the combination of the Latin words "omni," meaning "all," and "potens," meaning "power." It follows that if God is infinite and sovereign, then He must also be omnipotent. God has all power over all things at all times and in all ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Creation and Preservation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the clearest demonstrations of God's omnipotence is seen in the act of creation. In the book of Genesis, God spoke into existence everything that exists today. Unlike humans who require tools and materials to create, God simply spoke, and by the power of His word, everything came into being out of nothing. The psalmist affirms this when he says, "By the word of the LORD were the heavens made, their starry host by the breath of his mouth" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/33/Psalm-33-6.html"&gt;Psalm 33:6&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, God's power extends to the preservation of His creation. Every aspect of life on earth is sustained by God's continual provision. He provides us with food, clothing, and shelter, all from renewable resources sustained by His power as the preserver of mankind and animals (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/36/Psalm-36-6.html"&gt;Psalm 36:6&lt;/a&gt;). Even the vast seas are under His control, as He sets their limits so they do not overwhelm us (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Job/38/Job-38-8.html"&gt;Job 38:8-11&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Power Over Governments and Leaders&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God's omnipotence also extends to governments and leaders. He has the ability to restrain or allow them to go their own way according to His plans and purposes. The prophet Daniel acknowledges this when he says, "He changes times and seasons; he deposes kings and raises up others" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Daniel/2/Daniel-2-21.html"&gt;Daniel 2:21&lt;/a&gt;). Even Satan and his demons are subject to God's unlimited power. Satan's attack on Job was limited to certain actions because he was restrained by God's power (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Job/1/Job-1-12.html"&gt;Job 1:12&lt;/a&gt;; 2:6). Jesus Himself reminded Pontius Pilate that the power Pilate had over Him was granted to him by God (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/19/John-19-11.html"&gt;John 19:11&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/I0nXG02tpDw" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Limitations on God's Power&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While God is omnipotent, there are certain things that He cannot do because they are contrary to His holy character. For example, the Bible teaches that God cannot lie (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Numbers/23/Numbers-23-19.html"&gt;Numbers 23:19&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Titus/1/Titus-1-2.html"&gt;Titus 1:2&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/6/Hebrews-6-18.html"&gt;Hebrews 6:18&lt;/a&gt;). Lying goes against His moral perfection. Similarly, although God is all-powerful and hates evil, He allows evil to happen according to His good purpose. He uses certain evil events to accomplish His plans, such as allowing the killing of Jesus Christ for the redemption of mankind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Jesus Christ's Omnipotence&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As God incarnate, Jesus Christ is also omnipotent. His power was evident in the miracles He performed during His earthly ministry. From healing the sick and feeding thousands of people with a few loaves and fishes to calming storms and raising the dead, Jesus displayed His control over life and death (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/6/Mark-6-30.html"&gt;Mark 6:30-44&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/4/Mark-4-37.html"&gt;Mark 4:37-41&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/11/John-11-38.html"&gt;John 11:38-44&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/5/Mark-5-35.html"&gt;Mark 5:35-43&lt;/a&gt;). Ultimately, Jesus came to destroy death itself and bring sinners into a right relationship with God (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-Corinthians/15/1-Corinthians-15-22.html"&gt;1 Corinthians 15:22&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/2/Hebrews-2-14.html"&gt;Hebrews 2:14&lt;/a&gt;). He willingly sacrificed Himself on the cross, even though He had the power to call upon legions of angels for protection (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/26/Matthew-26-53.html"&gt;Matthew 26:53&lt;/a&gt;). Through His death and resurrection, Jesus demonstrated His ultimate power over sin and death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Believers Sharing in God's Power&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The amazing truth is that believers who are united with God through Jesus Christ can share in His power. The apostle Paul recognized this when he said, "Therefore I will boast all the more gladly about my weaknesses, so that Christ’s power may rest on me" (2 Corinthians 12:9b). When we are at our weakest, God's power is most evident in us. He is able to do more than we can ask or imagine by His power at work within us (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Ephesians/3/Ephesians-3-20.html"&gt;Ephesians 3:20&lt;/a&gt;). Despite our sin, it is God's power that keeps us in a state of grace (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/2-Timothy/1/2-Timothy-1-12.html"&gt;2 Timothy 1:12&lt;/a&gt;), and it is His power that keeps us from falling (Jude 24). Throughout eternity, the host of heaven will proclaim God's power (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Revelation/19/Revelation-19-1.html"&gt;Revelation 19:1&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding God's omnipotence is crucial for believers because it reminds us of His sovereignty and control over all things. It reassures us that nothing is beyond God's reach or ability. It encourages us to trust in His power to accomplish His purposes in our lives and in the world. Recognizing God's omnipotence also helps us to surrender our weaknesses and allow Christ's power to work through us, displaying His glory to others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reflect on times when you have seen or experienced God's power in your life. How did it affect your faith and trust in Him?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consider how recognizing God's omnipotence can bring comfort and assurance in difficult circumstances.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In what ways can you allow Christ's power to work through your weaknesses? How might this impact your daily life and relationships?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, God's omnipotence is an essential aspect of His character. He has all power over all things at all times and in all ways. From creation to preservation, from governments to miracles, God's power is evident throughout the Bible. As believers, we have the privilege of sharing in His power through our union with Jesus Christ. Recognizing God's omnipotence strengthens our faith, encourages us to trust in His sovereign control, and empowers us to live for His glory.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/The Nature of God/Attributes"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>7 Powerful Reasons Why God is Great: A Christian's Ultimate Guide to Divine Greatness</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/god-is-great/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-06-27T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-06-27T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-06-27:/god-is-great/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;God is Great&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Bible, God is described as great in numerous verses, such as &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/145/Psalm-145-3.html"&gt;Psalm 145:3&lt;/a&gt; which declares, “Great is the LORD and most worthy of praise; his greatness no one can fathom.” The word "great" in this context means preeminent, above the norm, or distinguished. It …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;God is Great&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Bible, God is described as great in numerous verses, such as &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/145/Psalm-145-3.html"&gt;Psalm 145:3&lt;/a&gt; which declares, “Great is the LORD and most worthy of praise; his greatness no one can fathom.” The word "great" in this context means preeminent, above the norm, or distinguished. It signifies God's superior character and quality, setting Him apart from human beings we may consider great. When the Bible describes God as great, it calls attention to His worthiness to be worshiped and adored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout the Bible, we see evidence of God's greatness through His wondrous works. He is described as having great love (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-John/3/1-John-3-1.html"&gt;1 John 3:1&lt;/a&gt;), great patience (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/9/Romans-9-22.html"&gt;Romans 9:22&lt;/a&gt;), great faithfulness (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Lamentations/3/Lamentations-3-22.html"&gt;Lamentations 3:22&lt;/a&gt;–23), and incomparably great power (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Ephesians/1/Ephesians-1-19.html"&gt;Ephesians 1:19&lt;/a&gt;). Jesus is referred to as our great God and Savior (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Titus/2/Titus-2-13.html"&gt;Titus 2:13&lt;/a&gt;) and a great priest over the house of God (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/10/Hebrews-10-21.html"&gt;Hebrews 10:21&lt;/a&gt;). The crowd was amazed at the greatness of God when Jesus cast out a demon from a boy (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/9/Luke-9-43.html"&gt;Luke 9:43&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Limitless Greatness of God&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God's greatness cannot be compared to anything or anyone else. He created everything in existence, making Him far superior to His creations. He is bigger than any being and cannot be confined by time or space. His wisdom surpasses human understanding, using what may seem foolish to confound those who think themselves wise. While all created things are finite, God is infinite. He defines greatness itself, and all other uses of the word are mere echoes of His greatness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the greatness of God helps us develop a proper perspective of His sovereignty and majesty. It reminds us that He is above all and worthy of our worship and adoration. Recognizing God's greatness also humbles us, as we realize our own limitations and the need to rely on Him for wisdom, guidance, and salvation. It encourages us to approach Him with awe and reverence, seeking to align our lives with His will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take a moment to reflect on the greatness of God. Consider His wondrous works throughout history and how they reveal His power and love. How does recognizing God's greatness impact your relationship with Him? In what ways can you express your awe and reverence for Him in your daily life?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Greatness of God in Creation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the ways we see the greatness of God is through His creation. &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/1/Genesis-1-1.html"&gt;Genesis 1:1&lt;/a&gt; tells us that "In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth." This act of creation demonstrates His immense power and wisdom. The complexity and beauty we observe in the natural world point to a Creator who is far greater than anything we can comprehend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Marvels of the Universe&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we look up at the night sky and contemplate the vastness of the universe, we are reminded of God's greatness. The countless stars, galaxies, and celestial bodies all testify to His power and creativity. The sheer size and intricacy of the cosmos reveal a Creator who is beyond our comprehension. As &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/19/Psalm-19-1.html"&gt;Psalm 19:1&lt;/a&gt; says, "The heavens declare the glory of God; the skies proclaim the work of his hands."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Wonder of Life&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another testament to God's greatness can be seen in the complexity of life. From microscopic organisms to majestic animals, each creature showcases His design and purpose. The intricate systems within our bodies, such as the circulatory, respiratory, and nervous systems, highlight His wisdom and attention to detail. Even the tiniest cell contains a level of complexity that defies human understanding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recognizing the greatness of God in creation helps us appreciate His handiwork and understand our place in the world. It reminds us that we are part of a much larger story, intricately woven by a Creator who is infinitely greater than ourselves. Understanding that God is the source of all life and beauty can lead us to worship and praise Him for His marvelous works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take a moment to observe the natural world around you. Consider the diversity of plants and animals, the awe-inspiring landscapes, and the delicate balance of ecosystems. How does acknowledging God's greatness in creation impact your appreciation for the world? How can you be a better steward of the environment to honor and reflect God's greatness?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Greatness of God in History&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God's greatness is not only evident in creation but also in His interaction with humanity throughout history. From the Old Testament to the New Testament, we see His mighty acts and His faithfulness to His people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Exodus and the Red Sea&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most significant displays of God's greatness is seen in the Exodus story. God delivered the Israelites from slavery in Egypt through a series of miraculous events. The parting of the Red Sea, allowing the Israelites to cross on dry ground while drowning their pursuers, demonstrated God's power over nature and His commitment to His chosen people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Miracles of Jesus&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the New Testament, we witness the greatness of God through the ministry of Jesus Christ. Jesus performed numerous miracles, including healing the sick, raising the dead, and calming storms. These miracles showcased His authority over sickness, death, and creation itself. Each miracle pointed to His divine nature and revealed God's great love for humanity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding God's greatness in history helps us trust in His faithfulness and power in our own lives. Just as He acted mightily in the past, we can have confidence that He will continue to work in our present circumstances. Recognizing God's greatness in history also encourages us to seek His guidance and align our lives with His purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reflect on the stories of God's greatness in the Bible, such as the Exodus and the miracles of Jesus. How do these stories impact your faith and trust in God? In what ways can you look for God's greatness in your own life and circumstances?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Greatness of God in Salvation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God's greatness is ultimately revealed in His plan of salvation for humanity. Through Jesus Christ, God demonstrated His immense love and mercy, providing a way for us to be reconciled to Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Cross and Resurrection&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pinnacle of God's greatness is seen in the sacrificial death and resurrection of Jesus Christ. On the cross, Jesus bore the weight of humanity's sin, paying the price for our redemption. His resurrection from the dead conquered sin and death, displaying God's power over the forces that held humanity captive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Gift of Grace&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God's greatness is also evident in His offer of salvation by grace through faith. &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Ephesians/2/Ephesians-2-8.html"&gt;Ephesians 2:8-9&lt;/a&gt; declares, "For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith—and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God—not by works so that no one can boast." This gift of salvation demonstrates God's great love and mercy towards us, as we are unable to earn or deserve it on our own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding God's greatness in salvation brings hope, assurance, and gratitude. It reminds us that our salvation is not based on our own efforts but on God's unfathomable love and grace. Recognizing His greatness in salvation also compels us to share this good news with others, so they too can experience the life-transforming power of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider the magnitude of what God has accomplished through Jesus' death and resurrection. How does recognizing God's greatness in salvation impact your understanding of His love for you? How can you share this message of salvation with others and demonstrate God's greatness through your own life?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Response to God's Greatness&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In light of God's greatness, our response should be one of humble worship and adoration. &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/150/Psalm-150-2.html"&gt;Psalm 150:2&lt;/a&gt; urges us to praise Him for His acts of power and surpassing greatness. Recognizing His greatness should lead us to seek a deeper relationship with Him and align our lives with His will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Trust and Surrender&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trusting in God's greatness means surrendering our own plans and desires to His perfect will. It involves acknowledging that He knows what is best for us and submitting to His guidance. Trusting in His greatness also means relying on His strength and wisdom rather than our own understanding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Gratitude and Praise&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Expressing gratitude and offering praise are natural responses to God's greatness. When we recognize the immense love, power, and faithfulness of God, it should stir within us a deep sense of gratitude. We should offer Him our heartfelt thanks for His great works in our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Responding to God's greatness with trust, surrender, gratitude, and praise deepens our relationship with Him. It helps us grow in faith and draws us closer to His heart. As we actively live out our response to God's greatness, we become witnesses of His goodness and love to those around us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reflect on your own response to God's greatness. Are you trusting Him fully and surrendering your plans to His will? Are you expressing gratitude and offering praise for His work in your life? How can you actively respond to God's greatness today and live as a witness of His love?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God is truly great beyond measure. From the wonders of creation to the mighty acts throughout history to the salvation offered through Jesus Christ, His greatness is evident. Recognizing God's greatness helps us develop a proper perspective of His sovereignty, power, and love. It humbles us and leads us to worship and adore Him. Let us respond to God's greatness by trusting Him, surrendering to His will, expressing gratitude, and offering praise. May we continually seek a deeper relationship with Him and live as witnesses of His greatness in the world.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/The Nature of God/Attributes"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Divine Goodness Unveiled: Embracing the Ultimate Goodness of God</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/god-is-good/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-06-04T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-06-04T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-06-04:/god-is-good/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;God is Good&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God's goodness is an essential aspect of His nature. The Bible tells us that "God is light; in Him, there is no darkness at all" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-John/1/1-John-1-5.html"&gt;1 John 1:5&lt;/a&gt;).

&lt;p&gt;God's goodness is an essential aspect of His nature. The Bible tells us that "God is light; in Him, there is no darkness at all" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-John/1/1-John-1-5.html"&gt;1 John 1:5&lt;/a&gt;). This means that God always acts according to what is right, true, and good. His goodness is inherent and cannot be separated from Him. God is the standard of all that is good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Nature of God's Goodness&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God's goodness means that He has no evil within Him. His intentions and motivations are always good, and He consistently does what is right. The outcome of His plan is always good as well (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/50/Genesis-50-20.html"&gt;Genesis 50:20&lt;/a&gt;). God's goodness extends from His nature to everything He does (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/119/Psalm-119-68.html"&gt;Psalm 119:68&lt;/a&gt;). It is a fundamental part of who He is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;God's Creation and Goodness&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything that God created was initially good (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/1/Genesis-1-31.html"&gt;Genesis 1:31&lt;/a&gt;). God's goodness is evident in the beauty and harmony of His creation. He can only create what is good because He Himself is fully good. Evil, on the other hand, is the absence of goodness and anything contrary to God's nature (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Habakkuk/1/Habakkuk-1-13.html"&gt;Habakkuk 1:13&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-John/1/1-John-1-5.html"&gt;1 John 1:5&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rGHMHVaKVy0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The Law as a Reflection of God's Goodness&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God's goodness is showcased in the Law He gave to Israel. The Law is holy, righteous, and good (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/7/Romans-7-12.html"&gt;Romans 7:12&lt;/a&gt;). It reflects God's character and reveals His standards for righteousness and justice. The Law was given for the well-being and benefit of His people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Thankfulness for God's Goodness&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God's goodness should lead us to thankfulness. We are encouraged to give thanks to the Lord because He is good (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/107/Psalm-107-1.html"&gt;Psalm 107:1&lt;/a&gt;). However, people often choose to reject or ignore God's goodness due to their sinful nature (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/3/John-3-19.html"&gt;John 3:19&lt;/a&gt;). In the Old Testament, the Israelites repeatedly forgot God's goodness and turned away from Him (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/78/Psalm-78-11.html"&gt;Psalm 78:11&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;God's Goodness and Redemption&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God's goodness is most clearly seen in His plan to redeem humanity from sin. The gospel is the "good news" that God sent His Son as the perfect sacrifice to forgive our sins. God desires that all people come to repentance and experience His goodness (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/2-Peter/3/2-Peter-3-9.html"&gt;2 Peter 3:9&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/2/Romans-2-4.html"&gt;Romans 2:4&lt;/a&gt;). Through Jesus, we can taste and see that the Lord is good (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/34/Psalm-34-8.html"&gt;Psalm 34:8&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding and acknowledging God's goodness is crucial for our relationship with Him. It helps us recognize His love, faithfulness, and righteousness. Knowing that God is good gives us hope and assurance in times of difficulty, knowing that He works all things for our ultimate good (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/8/Romans-8-28.html"&gt;Romans 8:28&lt;/a&gt;). It also challenges us to respond with gratitude and obedience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does recognizing God's goodness impact your view of Him and your relationship with Him?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In what ways can you cultivate a heart of thankfulness for God's goodness in your life?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does understanding God's goodness give you hope and assurance in challenging circumstances?&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One common question asked by skeptics of God, the Bible, and Christianity is whether God can create a rock so heavy that He cannot lift it. This question challenges the concept of God's omnipotence, suggesting that if He can create such a rock, then He is not truly all-powerful. On the other hand, if He cannot create such a rock, then He is also not all-powerful. This argument posits that omnipotence is self-contradictory, therefore concluding that God cannot be omnipotent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, this question is based on a misunderstanding of the terms "almighty" or "omnipotent." These terms do not imply that God can do absolutely anything. Rather, they describe the extent of God's power. Power is the ability to effect change or make something happen. The Bible affirms that God has unlimited power (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Job/11/Job-11-7.html"&gt;Job 11:7-11&lt;/a&gt;, 37:23; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/2-Corinthians/6/2-Corinthians-6-18.html"&gt;2 Corinthians 6:18&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Revelation/4/Revelation-4-8.html"&gt;Revelation 4:8&lt;/a&gt;). Therefore, God can do whatever is possible to be done. However, He cannot do things that are actually impossible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea of true impossibility is not based on the amount of power one possesses but on what is genuinely possible. Adding more power does not make the truly impossible possible. Thus, unless context indicates otherwise, impossibility has the same meaning regardless of God's involvement (e.g., &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/19/Matthew-19-26.html"&gt;Matthew 19:26&lt;/a&gt; contrasting man's ability with God's).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the limits of God's omnipotence is crucial for grasping the nature of God and His relationship with creation. It helps us avoid misconceptions about what it means for God to be all-powerful and ensures that we approach theological questions with a clear understanding of His attributes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LcJkyarOQCk" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider how our understanding of God's omnipotence affects our perspective on His character and the nature of reality. How does recognizing the difference between what is possible and impossible affect our faith in God's power? How might this understanding impact our trust in God's promises and His ability to fulfill them?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;God's Nature and the Nature of Reality&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bible itself acknowledges certain things that God cannot do, such as lying or denying Himself (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/6/Hebrews-6-18.html"&gt;Hebrews 6:18&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/2-Timothy/2/2-Timothy-2-13.html"&gt;2 Timothy 2:13&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Titus/1/Titus-1-2.html"&gt;Titus 1:2&lt;/a&gt;). These limitations arise from the nature of God and the nature of reality itself. God cannot do what is genuinely impossible to be done, like creating a two-sided triangle or a married bachelor. These things are contradictions and truly impossible within the framework of reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The notion that God can create a rock so heavy that He cannot lift it falls into the category of a contradiction. In order for a rock to defeat an infinite amount of lifting power, it would need to be infinitely large. However, material objects cannot be infinite, only God is infinite. The concept of two infinites is contradictory, and therefore, such a rock cannot exist. Consequently, the question of whether God can create a rock that He cannot lift is essentially asking if God can make a contradiction, which is something He cannot do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recognizing the limits of what God can do helps us grasp His nature more fully. It prevents us from assigning contradictory expectations to Him and allows us to understand that some things are inherently impossible due to their contradictory nature. This understanding deepens our appreciation for the coherence and consistency of God's character.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider how understanding that God cannot do what is genuinely impossible affects your perception of His reliability and trustworthiness. How does this understanding impact your understanding of the biblical accounts and miracles performed by Jesus? Does it challenge or reinforce your faith in God's power?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, the question of whether God can create a rock so heavy that He cannot lift it is based on a misconception of God's omnipotence. Being almighty does not mean that God can do anything, but rather, that He possesses unlimited power within the bounds of what is genuinely possible. True impossibility is not overcome by adding more power. God's inability to do what is genuinely impossible does not diminish His omnipotence but instead highlights the consistency and coherence of His nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the limits of God's power helps us avoid misconceptions and deepen our understanding of His character. Recognizing that some things are inherently impossible due to their contradictory nature allows us to approach theological questions with clarity and discernment. Ultimately, this understanding reinforces our faith in God's power and reliability as we trust in His ability to accomplish what is possible within His nature and the scope of reality.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/The Nature of God/Attributes"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Unveiling the Limitations of What God Cannot Do: A Christian Perspective</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/god-cannot/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-05-16T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-05-16T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-05-16:/god-cannot/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;God's Limitless Power and Wisdom&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we gaze up at the stars on a clear night, we are reminded of the awe-inspiring power and wisdom of God. Genesis 1 tells us that God created every single star in the universe. Just think about the incredible power contained within one star! But it's not just about raw power; there is also intelligence and design woven into every aspect of our universe, from the smallest DNA strand to the tiniest subatomic particle. God's power and wisdom are truly beyond our comprehension.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/18/Genesis-18-14.html"&gt;Genesis 18:14&lt;/a&gt;, the Lord asks Abraham, "Is anything too hard for the Lord?" This rhetorical question emphasizes that nothing is too difficult or impossible for God. Similarly, when Moses questioned how God could possibly provide enough meat for several million Israelites in the wilderness, God responded by asking Moses if His arm was too short (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Numbers/11/Numbers-11-23.html"&gt;Numbers 11:23&lt;/a&gt;). In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-Samuel/14/1-Samuel-14-6.html"&gt;1 Samuel 14:6&lt;/a&gt;, Jonathan tells his armor bearer that victory does not require a large army because the Lord can bring about triumph with just a few soldiers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Jeremiah/32/Jeremiah-32-17.html"&gt;Jeremiah 32:17&lt;/a&gt; proclaims, "Ah Lord God! Behold, You have made the heavens and the earth by Your great power and outstretched arm. There is nothing too hard for You" (KJV). This verse affirms that God's power knows no bounds. Even in the spiritual realm, those who seem far from salvation are not beyond God's reach (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/10/Mark-10-25.html"&gt;Mark 10:25-27&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God's power extends to His love and mercy as well. He loves us to such an extent that He was willing to send His own Son, Jesus Christ, to die on the cross of Calvary and pay the penalty for our sins. This act of supreme sacrifice demonstrates His immense love and mercy towards fallen humanity. &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/3/John-3-16.html"&gt;John 3:16&lt;/a&gt; beautifully captures this truth: "For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life" (KJV). God's love is not limited to "good" people because there are none. Instead, His love is extended to all of us, sinful and rebellious as we are (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/3/Romans-3-10.html"&gt;Romans 3:10-23&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Limits of God's Actions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5MChgCghLJg" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While God's power is limitless, there are certain things that He cannot do because they would contradict His character and nature. For example, &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Titus/1/Titus-1-2.html"&gt;Titus 1:2&lt;/a&gt; tells us that God cannot lie. This is rooted in His holiness, for He is completely without sin (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/6/Isaiah-6-3.html"&gt;Isaiah 6:3&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-Peter/1/1-Peter-1-16.html"&gt;1 Peter 1:16&lt;/a&gt;). Furthermore, because of His justice, God cannot simply overlook sin. However, through the sacrifice of Jesus Christ, He is able to forgive those who place their faith in Him (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/53/Isaiah-53-1.html"&gt;Isaiah 53:1-12&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/3/Romans-3-26.html"&gt;Romans 3:26&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the limitless power and wisdom of God has profound implications for our lives as Christians. It reminds us that no matter what challenges we face, God is more than capable of handling them. We can trust in His strength and wisdom to guide us through any trial or difficulty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recognizing the depth of God's love and mercy also helps us grasp the incredible grace extended to us through the sacrifice of Jesus Christ. We are reminded that we do not deserve this forgiveness, yet it is freely offered to us. This knowledge should inspire gratitude and motivate us to live lives that honor and serve God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Think About It&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does contemplating the power and wisdom of God impact your faith?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In what ways can you rely on God's strength and wisdom in your own life?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does understanding the depth of God's love and mercy affect how you view yourself and others?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consider the sacrifice of Jesus on the cross. How does this act of love demonstrate the extent of God's love for humanity?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can you express gratitude for God's forgiveness and respond to it in your daily life?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By reflecting on these questions, we can deepen our understanding of God's limitless power, wisdom, love, and mercy. May we continually seek to honor and trust in Him, knowing that He is always present and ready to help us in times of trouble (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/46/Psalm-46-1.html"&gt;Psalm 46:1&lt;/a&gt;, ESV).&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/The Nature of God/Attributes"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Ultimate Guide: Is God Logical?

&lt;p&gt;Believing in God is logical because it provides consistent answers to important philosophical questions. For example, the concept of an infinite amount of past time is illogical since it would mean we are currently at the "end" of an infinite string of moments. Therefore, there must have been a beginning moment, which necessitates a cause that is itself non-caused. Logically, this cause is God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2. Fine-Tuning of the Universe&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another reason belief in God is logical is that the universe appears to be precisely designed to allow for life, particularly complex life that is self-aware. This intricate arrangement leaves us with two possible explanations: some kind of God or random luck. However, attributing it to mere luck is not a logical answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;3. The Existence of Logic Itself&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact that human beings think logically supports the idea of God as a rational belief. If God does not exist, then intelligence, purpose, and meaning are merely illusions created by physics and chemistry. Without God, our thoughts lack meaning and cannot be relied upon as accurate reflections of reality. Belief in logic requires belief in some kind of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;4. Objectivity, Eternality, and Non-Materiality&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those who believe in the laws of logic rely on something objective, eternal, and non-material. It would be hypocritical for someone who values logic to object to the idea of an immaterial, eternal, and objective God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;5. Logical Nature of God&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God Himself is logical based on His words and actions. He plans, communicates, discusses, and acts. He even speaks of "reasoning" with human beings. God distinguishes between truth and falsehood, a fundamental aspect of basic logic. Although His actions may not always align with human preferences, this does not make them illogical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eINsKdc7K-k" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;6. The Nature of a Perfect Being&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact that there are certain things God "cannot" do, such as lie or change, is evidence of His logical nature. A truly perfect being, by definition, cannot change without ceasing to be perfect. Therefore, God cannot contradict His own nature without violating the laws of logic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the logical nature of God helps us to strengthen our faith and provides a rational foundation for our beliefs. It allows us to engage in meaningful discussions and address philosophical questions that may arise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider how the existence of logic itself points towards the existence of God. Reflect on the implications of a logical God and how it aligns with your understanding of His character and actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, God is indeed logical. Belief in God provides consistent answers to important philosophical questions, the fine-tuning of the universe supports the existence of a Creator, and the fact that we think logically points towards a rational belief in God. Furthermore, God's words and actions demonstrate His logical nature, and His inability to contradict His own nature affirms His adherence to the laws of logic. Understanding the logical nature of God strengthens our faith and provides a rational basis for our beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/The Nature of God/Attributes"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Unveiling the Divine: 5 Communicable and Incommunicable Attributes of God</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/communicable-incommunicable-attributes/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-05-15T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-05-15T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-05-15:/communicable-incommunicable-attributes/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Communicable and Incommunicable Attributes of God&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The attributes of God can be divided into two categories: communicable and incommunicable. Communicable attributes are those that humans can also possess, although only to a finite extent.

&lt;p&gt;The attributes of God can be divided into two categories: communicable and incommunicable. Communicable attributes are those that humans can also possess, although only to a finite extent. Incommunicable attributes, on the other hand, are exclusive to God and cannot be shared with His creatures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Communicable Attributes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Love&lt;/strong&gt;: God is love, and humans can also love, although imperfectly. Our ability to love is derived from God's love for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Justice&lt;/strong&gt;: While humans have a sense of justice and can carry out justice, we do so imperfectly. God, however, is perfectly just.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Creativity&lt;/strong&gt;: God is the Creator, and while humans are creative, we cannot create ex nihilo (out of nothing) as God can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grace and Mercy&lt;/strong&gt;: God extends grace and mercy towards us, and as we grow in Christ and are transformed by the Holy Spirit, we can also exhibit these attributes in a more meaningful and perfected sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Goodness&lt;/strong&gt;: God is inherently good, and we are called to reflect His goodness in our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Truthfulness&lt;/strong&gt;: God is the source of all truth, and as followers of Christ, we are called to live in truthfulness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rational Thought&lt;/strong&gt;: Humans have been created in the image of God, which includes the capacity for rational thought and reasoning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Relationality&lt;/strong&gt;: God exists in perfect relationship within the Trinity, and we are created for relationship with Him and with others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the communicable attributes of God helps us to realize that as His image-bearers, we have been designed to reflect His character in our lives. It also highlights our need for the transforming work of the Holy Spirit to help us grow in these attributes and become more like Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can you grow in exhibiting the communicable attributes of God in your own life? &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In what ways do you see these attributes reflected in the lives of other believers?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Incommunicable Attributes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bcbL6J7vzbQ" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Omnipotence&lt;/strong&gt;: God is all-powerful, and His power is beyond human comprehension. We can define this attribute, but we cannot fully comprehend or possess it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Immutable&lt;/strong&gt;: God is unchanging, while humans are subject to change and growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Self-Existence&lt;/strong&gt;: God exists independently of anything else, whereas humans are dependent on Him for our existence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recognizing and honoring the incommunicable attributes of God reminds us of His uniqueness and greatness. It calls us to revere, worship, trust, and praise the Creator who possesses these attributes that are beyond our comprehension.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does recognizing God's omnipotence, immutability, and self-existence impact your understanding of who He is?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can focusing on these incommunicable attributes deepen your awe and reverence for God?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, the communicable attributes of God are those that humans can possess to a finite extent. These include love, justice, creativity, grace, mercy, goodness, truthfulness, rational thought, and relationality. As we grow in Christ and are transformed by the Holy Spirit, we can exhibit these attributes more meaningfully. On the other hand, the incommunicable attributes of God are exclusive to Him and include omnipotence, immutability, and self-existence. Recognizing both sets of attributes helps us understand our relationship with God and our purpose as His image-bearers. Let us strive to reflect His communicable attributes while acknowledging and revering His incommunicable attributes.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/The Nature of God/Attributes"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Divine Omniscience: Unveiling God's Infinite Knowledge for Believers</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/god-omniscient/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-04-05T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-04-05T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-04-05:/god-omniscient/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;God's Omniscience&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Omniscience is the state of having total knowledge, the quality of knowing everything. In the Christian faith, it is believed that God is omniscient. This means that He has complete knowledge and understanding of all things. His omniscience is not limited to any one person in the Godhead—Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are all by nature omniscient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What Does God Know?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God's omniscience extends to every aspect of His creation. He knows not only the smallest details of our lives but also everything that happens around us. He even knows when a sparrow falls or when we lose a single hair. Nothing escapes His knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, God's knowledge encompasses not only the present but also the past and future. He knows what will occur until the end of history itself. His knowledge is not limited by time or space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The New Testament Perspective&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the New Testament, Jesus' omniscience is evident. In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Acts/1/Acts-1-24.html"&gt;Acts 1:24&lt;/a&gt;, the apostles pray, "Lord, you know everyone's heart," implying Jesus' omniscience. This is necessary for Him to be able to receive petitions and intercede at God's right hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During His earthly ministry, Jesus demonstrated His omniscience by knowing people's thoughts and details about their lives before even meeting them. For example, He knew about the woman at the well's marital history and also informed His disciples about the death of Lazarus while being physically distant from him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Paradox of Jesus' Omniscience&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Jesus demonstrated omniscience on earth, there are instances where He asked questions that imply a lack of knowledge. However, these questions were often for the benefit of His audience rather than Himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's important to note that Jesus took on human nature and experienced limitations as a man. He "grew in wisdom and stature" and learned obedience through suffering. This controlled lack of knowledge, such as not knowing when the world would end, can be seen as an act of humility in order to fully share in our human nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Significance of God's Omniscience&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God's omniscience has significant implications for our faith and relationship with Him. We can find security in knowing that there is nothing too hard for an omniscient God. He has known us from eternity, even before creation. He foresaw our sin and yet, in His love, drew us to Himself through Jesus Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our knowledge of God will never be complete, but we can rest in the assurance that He promises never to fail us as long as we continue in Him. Our wonder, love, and praise for Him will continue to grow as we bask in the rays of His heavenly love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iWkM-s28kiM" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Understanding God's omniscience helps us develop a deep trust in Him. Knowing that God has complete knowledge and understanding of everything brings comfort and reassurance. It also reminds us of His sovereignty and power over all things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recognizing God's omniscience challenges us to surrender to His wisdom and guidance. When we acknowledge that God knows better than we do, we can trust His plans for our lives even when they don't align with our own desires or understanding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowing that God is all-knowing also encourages us to approach Him with honesty and openness. We can confidently bring our thoughts, concerns, and desires before Him, knowing that He already knows them and desires an intimate relationship with us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Think About It&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How does the concept of God's omniscience impact your view of His sovereignty and control over your life?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In what ways can understanding God's omniscience deepen your trust and reliance on Him?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How does recognizing God's omniscience change the way you approach prayer and seek guidance from Him?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reflect on the comfort and reassurance that comes from knowing that God sees and understands every aspect of your life, even the smallest details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

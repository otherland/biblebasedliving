&lt;p&gt;The Bible teaches us that "God is spirit" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/4/John-4-24.html"&gt;John 4:24&lt;/a&gt;). This statement was made by Jesus to a woman who had questions about the proper way to worship God. It means that God the Father does not have a human body like we do.

&lt;p&gt;The Bible teaches us that "God is spirit" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/4/John-4-24.html"&gt;John 4:24&lt;/a&gt;). This statement was made by Jesus to a woman who had questions about the proper way to worship God. It means that God the Father does not have a human body like we do. While Jesus, as the Son of God, came to earth in human form, God the Father did not take on a physical body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to note that when the Bible sometimes speaks of God using terms like "hand," "ear," or "eyes," it is using anthropomorphism—a figurative language technique that describes God in terms humans can better understand. These descriptions should not be taken literally but rather help us comprehend certain aspects of God's character.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saying that God is spirit also means that He is invisible. &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Colossians/1/Colossians-1-15.html"&gt;Colossians 1:15&lt;/a&gt; refers to Him as the "invisible God," and &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-Timothy/1/1-Timothy-1-17.html"&gt;1 Timothy 1:17&lt;/a&gt; praises Him as the "immortal, invisible, the only God." Although God is spirit and invisible, He is a living and personal being. We can have a personal relationship with Him and know Him intimately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Nature of God&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God being spirit is essential for understanding His nature. If God had a physical body, He would be limited by time and space. However, as a spirit, He transcends these limitations and can exist in all places simultaneously. This concept helps us grasp His omnipresence—His ability to be present everywhere at once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EKibbFBmD94" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, God's spiritual nature allows us to understand His infiniteness. Being infinite means that there are no restrictions or boundaries on His existence. If God had a physical body, He would be limited in some way. But as a spirit, He is limitless and unbound by any physical or created constraints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Worshiping in Spirit and Truth&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus connects the fact that God is spirit with the idea of worshiping Him in spirit and truth. Worshiping in spirit means that we engage with God from the depths of our soul, with our heart and mind fully dedicated to Him. It is a worship that goes beyond external rituals and traditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Worshiping in truth means worshiping God accurately—the way He has revealed Himself to us through His Word, the Bible. It involves aligning our beliefs and practices with the truth found in Scripture and not relying solely on our own opinions or preferences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding that God is spirit helps us grasp the nature of our relationship with Him. It reminds us that He is not confined to a physical form, but rather a living and personal being who desires to have a genuine connection with us. Recognizing His invisibility also encourages us to seek Him with faith and trust rather than relying solely on what we can see or understand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recognizing that God is spirit also invites us into a deeper understanding of worship. It challenges us to move beyond outward expressions and rituals and instead approach worship with authenticity, sincerity, and reverence. Worshiping in spirit and truth enables us to cultivate a meaningful relationship with God and experience His presence in our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Think About It&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does the concept of God being spirit impact your understanding of who He is? How does it affect your relationship with Him?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In what ways can you engage in worship that goes beyond external rituals and traditions? How can you deepen your worship experience?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reflect on your understanding of worship in truth. How can you ensure that your beliefs and practices align with the truth revealed in Scripture?&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The immutability of God refers to His quality of not changing. It is a concept clearly taught throughout Scripture. In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Malachi/3/Malachi-3-6.html"&gt;Malachi 3:6&lt;/a&gt;, God affirms, "I the Lord do not change." This sentiment is echoed in other verses such as &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Numbers/23/Numbers-23-19.html"&gt;Numbers 23:19&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-Samuel/15/1-Samuel-15-29.html"&gt;1 Samuel 15 …&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;The Immutability of God&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The immutability of God refers to His quality of not changing. It is a concept clearly taught throughout Scripture. In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Malachi/3/Malachi-3-6.html"&gt;Malachi 3:6&lt;/a&gt;, God affirms, "I the Lord do not change." This sentiment is echoed in other verses such as &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Numbers/23/Numbers-23-19.html"&gt;Numbers 23:19&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-Samuel/15/1-Samuel-15-29.html"&gt;1 Samuel 15:29&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/46/Isaiah-46-9.html"&gt;Isaiah 46:9-11&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Ezekiel/24/Ezekiel-24-14.html"&gt;Ezekiel 24:14&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/James/1/James-1-17.html"&gt;James 1:17&lt;/a&gt; also teaches the immutability of God, stating that every good and perfect gift comes from Him and there is no variableness or shadow of turning in Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To understand the immutability of God, we can think of it in terms of the sun. The sun rises and sets, appears and disappears every day. It moves across the sky and casts its shadow. But with God, who is light itself, there is no darkness at all. There is no change with Him, nor anything like it. He is unchangeable in His nature, perfections, purposes, promises, and gifts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several logical reasons why God must be immutable. First, for change to occur, there must be a chronological order. There must be a point in time before the change and a point in time after the change. However, God exists outside of the constraints of time. He is eternal (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/33/Psalm-33-11.html"&gt;Psalm 33:11&lt;/a&gt;; 41:13; 90:2-4; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/17/John-17-5.html"&gt;John 17:5&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/2-Timothy/1/2-Timothy-1-9.html"&gt;2 Timothy 1:9&lt;/a&gt;), and therefore not subject to the limitations of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, the immutability of God is necessary for His perfection. If anything changes, it must either change for the better or the worse. But since God is perfect, He does not need anything. Therefore, He cannot change for the better or the worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thirdly, the immutability of God is related to His omniscience. When someone changes their mind, it is often because new information has come to light or the circumstances have changed. But God is omniscient and knows all things. He cannot learn something new that He did not already know. So, when the Bible speaks of God changing His mind, it is describing a change in dispensation and outward dealings toward man, not a change in God Himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pvhBX_5z0fw" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Numbers/23/Numbers-23-19.html"&gt;Numbers 23:19&lt;/a&gt; affirms the immutability of God, stating that He is not a man that He should lie or change His mind. This verse emphasizes that God does not change His mind. The doctrine of God's immutability is further affirmed throughout Scripture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the immutability of God is important for our faith and relationship with Him. It assures us that God's character and promises remain constant. We can trust in His unchanging nature and rely on His faithfulness. It also reminds us that God's love and grace are not subject to fluctuation or alteration. His love for us is steadfast and unchanging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The immutability of God also has implications for our own lives. If we serve a God who does not change, we can have confidence in His guidance and direction. We don't have to worry about God changing His mind about us or His plans for our lives. This stability and constancy provide us with security and peace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How does the immutability of God impact your understanding of His character?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In what ways does the concept of an unchanging God bring you comfort and assurance?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How does knowing that God does not change affect your trust in Him and your relationship with Him?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Bible provides us with a clear understanding of what God is like and what He is not like. Without relying on the authority of the Bible, any attempt to explain God's attributes would be no better than an opinion, which is often incorrect when it comes to understanding God. It is crucial for us to try to understand what God is like because failure to do so can lead us to set up false gods and worship them against His will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Self-Revealing Nature of God&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God has chosen to reveal knowledge of Himself through creation, the Bible, and the Word made flesh—Jesus Christ. Creation itself offers a glimpse of God's works and reveals His awesomeness through its vastness, complexity, beauty, and order. By considering these aspects of creation, we can begin to grasp the greatness of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Names of God&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reading through some of the names of God can also help us understand what He is like. Here are a few examples:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Elohim - This name refers to God as the strong One, divine.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adonai - It signifies a Lord who establishes a Master-to-servant relationship.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;El Elyon - This name emphasizes that God is the Most High, the strongest One.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;El Roi - It means that God is the strong One who sees everything.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;El Shaddai - This name highlights that God is Almighty.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;El Olam - It signifies that God is the Everlasting God.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yahweh - This name means "I AM" and represents the eternal, self-existent nature of God.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Attributes of God&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eternal and Immutable&lt;/strong&gt;: God is eternal, meaning He had no beginning and will never cease to exist. He is immortal and infinite. Furthermore, God is unchanging (immutable), making Him absolutely reliable and trustworthy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Incomparable and Perfect&lt;/strong&gt;: God is unparalleled in His works and being. He is unequaled and perfect. There is no one like Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inscrutable and Omniscient&lt;/strong&gt;: God is inscrutable, unfathomable, unsearchable, and beyond complete understanding. However, He is omniscient, meaning He knows everything—the past, present, and future—along with our thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Just and Omnipotent&lt;/strong&gt;: God is just and does not show favoritism. He is also omnipotent, possessing all power. However, His actions are always in line with His character.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Omnipresent and Sovereign&lt;/strong&gt;: God is omnipresent, meaning He is present everywhere. Yet, this does not mean that God is everything. Additionally, God is sovereign—supreme over all creation, with all of His purposes prevailing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YfeZSRnQnI8" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spirit and Truth&lt;/strong&gt;: God is spirit, invisible to human eyes. He cannot be seen with physical senses but can be experienced through faith. Moreover, God is truth itself; He cannot lie or be corrupt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Holy and Gracious&lt;/strong&gt;: God is holy, separate from all moral defilement and hostile toward evil. He sees all wrongdoings and hates them. However, He is also gracious and extends His goodness, kindness, mercy, and love to us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One and Righteous&lt;/strong&gt;: God is one; there is no other like Him who can meet the deepest needs of our hearts. He alone deserves our worship and devotion. Furthermore, God is righteous—He cannot overlook wrongdoing, which required Jesus to experience God's wrath for our sins to be forgiven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the attributes of God is crucial for our faith. It helps us develop a proper understanding of who God is and how we should relate to Him. Knowing that God is eternal, immutable, and omnipotent gives us confidence in His promises and trustworthiness. Recognizing God's justice and righteousness reminds us of the seriousness of sin and the need for forgiveness through Jesus Christ. Understanding God's holiness and grace helps us appreciate His love and mercy towards us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reflecting on the attributes of God can lead us to a deeper appreciation of His character and nature. Consider the following questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does knowing that God is eternal and unchanging impact your trust in Him?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In what ways does understanding God's justice and righteousness affect your view of sin and the need for forgiveness?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does recognizing God's holiness and grace influence your understanding of His love for you?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By pondering these questions, we can deepen our relationship with God and grow in our understanding of His attributes.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/The Nature of God/The Basics"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Discovering the Divine: Unveiling the Nature of God in Christianity</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/nature-of-god/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-07-30T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-07-30T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-07-30:/nature-of-god/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;The Nature of God&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;God's Holiness&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most important aspects of God's nature is His holiness. Holiness means being set apart, and God is clearly separate from His creation based on His nature and attributes. In the Bible, &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Revelation/15/Revelation-15-4.html"&gt;Revelation 15:4&lt;/a&gt; says, "You alone are holy," and &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Revelation/4/Revelation-4-8.html"&gt;Revelation …&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;The Nature of God&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;God's Holiness&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most important aspects of God's nature is His holiness. Holiness means being set apart, and God is clearly separate from His creation based on His nature and attributes. In the Bible, &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Revelation/15/Revelation-15-4.html"&gt;Revelation 15:4&lt;/a&gt; says, "You alone are holy," and &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Revelation/4/Revelation-4-8.html"&gt;Revelation 4:8&lt;/a&gt; describes the four living creatures singing to God day and night, "Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God Almighty." God's holiness makes Him a "consuming fire" that will judge all sin (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/12/Hebrews-12-29.html"&gt;Hebrews 12:29&lt;/a&gt;). Throughout Scripture, there are beautiful doxologies that exalt God's holiness, such as &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/99/Psalm-99-9.html"&gt;Psalm 99:9&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/33/Psalm-33-21.html"&gt;Psalm 33:21&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/77/Psalm-77-13.html"&gt;Psalm 77:13&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/89/Psalm-89-18.html"&gt;Psalm 89:18&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/105/Psalm-105-3.html"&gt;Psalm 105:3&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Understanding God's holiness helps us recognize His uniqueness and separateness from the world. It reminds us that we should approach Him with reverence and awe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; How does recognizing God's holiness impact your worship and relationship with Him?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Trinity&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God is an eternal spirit who has always existed in three distinct persons: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. He is one God (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Deuteronomy/6/Deuteronomy-6-4.html"&gt;Deuteronomy 6:4&lt;/a&gt;) but exists as three Persons. While God does not have a physical body, the Son became incarnate in Jesus Christ. Denying the Trinity or viewing God the Father as a man is a false doctrine. It is essential to affirm both the humanity and deity of Christ (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/2-John/1/2-John-1-7.html"&gt;2 John 1:7&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Understanding the Trinity teaches us about the complexity and unity within the nature of God. It also helps us understand how each person of the Trinity plays a unique role in our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; How does recognizing the Trinity affect your understanding of salvation?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;God's Sovereignty&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God, by nature, is sovereign. He has absolute authority over the entire universe and everything in it. His sovereignty is expressed in many ways, including His omnipotence. All of God's ways are right (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/145/Psalm-145-17.html"&gt;Psalm 145:17&lt;/a&gt;), and He is not constrained by time or place. He has a plan that has been in place from eternity past, and His purpose will be accomplished (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Daniel/4/Daniel-4-37.html"&gt;Daniel 4:37&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/115/Psalm-115-3.html"&gt;Psalm 115:3&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QPywCD-TSd0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Recognizing God's sovereignty helps us trust in His plans and purposes even when we don't understand them. It reminds us that God is ultimately in control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; How does understanding God's sovereignty impact your faith and trust in Him?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;God's Immutability&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God does not change; He is the same "yesterday, today, and forever" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/13/Hebrews-13-8.html"&gt;Hebrews 13:8&lt;/a&gt;). He explicitly states in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Malachi/3/Malachi-3-6.html"&gt;Malachi 3:6&lt;/a&gt;, "I the LORD do not change." Because of His unchanging nature, we can depend on His blessings. &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/James/1/James-1-17.html"&gt;James 1:17&lt;/a&gt; says, "Every good and perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of the heavenly lights, who does not change like shifting shadows."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Understanding God's immutability reassures us that His character and promises remain steadfast. We can rely on Him to be consistent in His love, mercy, and faithfulness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; How does knowing that God does not change impact your relationship with Him?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;God's Omniscience&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God knows everything from eternity past to eternity future. He knows everything we think, do, and say. He has personal knowledge of every person who has ever lived or will live, knowing them intimately in every way. &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Jeremiah/1/Jeremiah-1-5.html"&gt;Jeremiah 1:5&lt;/a&gt; says, "Before I formed you in the womb I knew you, before you were born, I set you apart."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Recognizing God's omniscience brings comfort and assurance. It reminds us that we are known and loved by a God who understands us completely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; How does the knowledge that God knows everything impact your prayer life and sense of security?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;God's Love and Wrath&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God's nature encompasses both love and wrath. He has a righteous anger against sin (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/7/Psalm-7-11.html"&gt;Psalm 7:11&lt;/a&gt;). However, out of His love for the world, He sent His only Son, Jesus Christ, to redeem us (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/3/John-3-16.html"&gt;John 3:16&lt;/a&gt;). God is not only loving but is love itself (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-John/4/1-John-4-16.html"&gt;1 John 4:16&lt;/a&gt;). His love is eternal, unchanging, perfect, and holy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Understanding God's love and wrath helps us grasp the depth of His character and the significance of our salvation through Jesus Christ. It also highlights the importance of sharing the gospel message with others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; How does knowing God's love and wrath impact your understanding of salvation and your relationship with others?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nature of God is multifaceted and complex. He is holy, separate from His creation. He exists as three distinct persons in the Trinity while being one God. God is sovereign, immutable, omniscient, loving, and just. Understanding these aspects of God's nature deepens our faith, shapes our worship, and strengthens our relationship with Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Our understanding of God's nature shapes our theology and informs how we live out our faith daily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The existence of God is evident in both creation and the human conscience, as stated in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/14/Psalm-14-1.html"&gt;Psalm 14:1&lt;/a&gt;. Therefore, the Bible does not attempt to prove God's existence but assumes it from the beginning (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/1/Genesis-1-1.html"&gt;Genesis 1:1&lt;/a&gt;). Instead, the Bible reveals God's nature, character, and …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Who is God?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The existence of God is evident in both creation and the human conscience, as stated in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/14/Psalm-14-1.html"&gt;Psalm 14:1&lt;/a&gt;. Therefore, the Bible does not attempt to prove God's existence but assumes it from the beginning (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/1/Genesis-1-1.html"&gt;Genesis 1:1&lt;/a&gt;). Instead, the Bible reveals God's nature, character, and work. It is crucial to have a correct understanding of God because false ideas about Him lead to idolatry. In simple terms, God can be defined as the Supreme Being, the Creator and Ruler of all things, and the Self-existent One who is perfect in power, goodness, and wisdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Characteristics of God&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;God's Spiritual Nature&lt;/strong&gt;: God is a spirit and cannot be physically perceived (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/4/John-4-24.html"&gt;John 4:24&lt;/a&gt;). This means that He does not have a physical body like humans do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Trinity&lt;/strong&gt;: While God is One, He exists as three distinct Persons - God the Father, God the Son (Jesus Christ), and God the Holy Spirit (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/3/Matthew-3-16.html"&gt;Matthew 3:16-17&lt;/a&gt;). This concept is difficult to fully comprehend but can be understood through an analogy of water existing in three forms: solid (ice), liquid (water), and gas (steam). Although different forms, they are all H2O.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;God's Attributes&lt;/strong&gt;: God possesses various attributes that define His nature. Some of these include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Infinite&lt;/strong&gt;: God has no limits or boundaries (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-Timothy/1/1-Timothy-1-17.html"&gt;1 Timothy 1:17&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Incomparable&lt;/strong&gt;: There is no one like God (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/2-Samuel/7/2-Samuel-7-22.html"&gt;2 Samuel 7:22&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unchanging&lt;/strong&gt;: God remains the same throughout time (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Malachi/3/Malachi-3-6.html"&gt;Malachi 3:6&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Omnipresent&lt;/strong&gt;: God exists everywhere simultaneously (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/139/Psalm-139-7.html"&gt;Psalm 139:7-12&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Omniscient&lt;/strong&gt;: God knows everything (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/147/Psalm-147-5.html"&gt;Psalm 147:5&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/40/Isaiah-40-28.html"&gt;Isaiah 40:28&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All-powerful&lt;/strong&gt;: God has all power and authority (Ephesians 1; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Revelation/19/Revelation-19-6.html"&gt;Revelation 19:6&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_ie9musGEqQ" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;God's Moral Attributes&lt;/strong&gt;: God is just, loving, truthful, and holy. He shows compassion, mercy, and grace. He judges sin but also offers forgiveness (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Acts/17/Acts-17-31.html"&gt;Acts 17:31&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Ephesians/2/Ephesians-2-4.html"&gt;Ephesians 2:4-5&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/14/John-14-6.html"&gt;John 14:6&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-John/1/1-John-1-5.html"&gt;1 John 1:5&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/2-Corinthians/1/2-Corinthians-1-3.html"&gt;2 Corinthians 1:3&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/9/Romans-9-15.html"&gt;Romans 9:15&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/5/Romans-5-17.html"&gt;Romans 5:17&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/5/Psalm-5-5.html"&gt;Psalm 5:5&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/130/Psalm-130-4.html"&gt;Psalm 130:4&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Understanding God through His Works&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To understand God fully, we must examine His works because what God does flows from who He is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Creation&lt;/strong&gt;: God is the Creator of the world (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/1/Genesis-1-1.html"&gt;Genesis 1:1&lt;/a&gt;) and everything in it. He brought the universe into existence out of nothing. The complexity and beauty of creation point to God's intelligence and creativity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sustenance&lt;/strong&gt;: God actively sustains the world by upholding its existence (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Colossians/1/Colossians-1-17.html"&gt;Colossians 1:17&lt;/a&gt;). Every breath we take and every moment we live is a result of God's sustaining power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Redemption&lt;/strong&gt;: God has an eternal plan that involves redeeming humanity from the curse of sin and death (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Ephesians/1/Ephesians-1-11.html"&gt;Ephesians 1:11&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Galatians/3/Galatians-3-13.html"&gt;Galatians 3:13-14&lt;/a&gt;). This plan centers around Jesus Christ, who became incarnate as the Son of Man to bridge the gap between God and humanity (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/1/John-1-14.html"&gt;John 1:14&lt;/a&gt;). Through Jesus, we can have forgiveness of sins, reconciliation with God, and eternal salvation (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Ephesians/1/Ephesians-1-7.html"&gt;Ephesians 1:7&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/15/John-15-15.html"&gt;John 15:15&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/5/Romans-5-10.html"&gt;Romans 5:10&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/2-Timothy/2/2-Timothy-2-10.html"&gt;2 Timothy 2:10&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Divine Intervention&lt;/strong&gt;: God is actively involved in our lives. He draws people to Jesus (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/6/John-6-44.html"&gt;John 6:44&lt;/a&gt;), disciplines His children (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/12/Hebrews-12-6.html"&gt;Hebrews 12:6&lt;/a&gt;), and will judge the world in the future (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Revelation/20/Revelation-20-11.html"&gt;Revelation 20:11-15&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding who God is and His nature is essential for our faith and relationship with Him. It helps us avoid idolatry and worshiping false gods. Knowing that God is just, loving, merciful, and gracious gives us confidence in His character. Recognizing His power and authority helps us trust that He is in control of all things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does knowing that God is present everywhere and knows everything impact your daily life?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does understanding God's attributes affect your perspective on difficult situations?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In what ways can you apply the knowledge of God's character and works to your relationship with Him?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, God is the Supreme Being, the Creator and Ruler of all things, who reveals Himself through creation, conscience, and His Word. He possesses various attributes that define His nature, including being infinite, incomparable, unchanging, omnipresent, omniscient, and all-powerful. God's moral attributes include justice, love, truthfulness, holiness, compassion, mercy, grace, judgment of sin, and forgiveness. Understanding God's works, such as creation, sustenance, redemption through Jesus Christ, and divine intervention, helps us grasp the depth of His love and involvement in our lives. Knowing who God is deepens our faith and relationship with Him.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/The Nature of God/The Basics"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Unlocking the Depths of Theology Proper: A Christian''s Essential Guide</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/theology-proper/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-07-13T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-07-13T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-07-13:/theology-proper/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Theology Proper: Understanding God and His Attributes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Theology proper is the study of God and His attributes. It focuses on understanding God the Father and delves into questions such as the existence of God, His attributes, and the nature of the Trinity. In this article, we will explore theology proper in a simplified manner while maintaining a biblical perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Does God Exist?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The very fact that some people aggressively try to disprove God's existence is actually an argument for His existence. The truth is, everyone ultimately knows that God exists. The evidence for God's existence is all around us, from the complexity of creation to the innate sense of morality within us. The study of theology proper affirms this truth and deepens our understanding of God's existence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Understanding God's Attributes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God possesses numerous attributes that define His nature. Some of these attributes include being immortal, invisible, all-wise, blessed, glorious, ancient, almighty, and victorious. These attributes are beautifully expressed in a hymn: "Immortal, invisible, God only wise...most blessed, most glorious, the Ancient of Days, Almighty, Victorious, thy great name we praise." Recognizing and understanding these attributes help us glorify and praise Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Mystery of the Trinity&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Trinity is one of the central doctrines in Christianity. While we can grasp some facts about the relationship between the different persons of the Trinity, it ultimately remains incomprehensible to our human minds. However, just because our finite minds struggle to fully comprehend it doesn't mean it is untrue or not based on biblical teachings. Theology proper acknowledges this mystery and encourages us to embrace and worship the triune God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Sovereignty vs. Free Will&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question of whether God is sovereign or if we have free will often arises when discussing matters of salvation. While our free will may come into play in certain areas of life (such as choosing what to eat for dinner), the focus in theology proper is primarily on our eternal destiny. The study of God's sovereignty and our free will in relation to salvation helps us understand that it is through God's grace that we are saved, and yet we are still responsible for making a choice to accept or reject His gift of salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ad5FTJ07cKs" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Exploring God's Attributes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Theology proper delves into various attributes of God, including His omnipresence, omniscience, omnipotence, and eternality. These attributes help us understand who God is and what He does. For example, God's omnipresence means that He is present everywhere at all times. His omniscience means that He knows everything, past, present, and future. His omnipotence means that He is all-powerful and capable of doing anything. And His eternality means that He exists outside the constraints of time. Understanding these attributes helps us develop a deeper relationship with God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Correcting Misconceptions About God&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many people have misconceptions about God that affect how they relate to Him. Some view Him as a brutal tyrant with no love or grace, while others see Him solely as a loving friend with no justice or anger. Both of these perceptions are incorrect. Theology proper guides us in understanding that God is both full of mercy, love, and grace, as well as righteous, holy, and just. He grants mercy and executes judgment. He punishes sin and forgives sin. The study of theology proper helps us gain a more accurate understanding of who God truly is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study of theology proper matters because it helps us develop a deeper understanding of God's nature and character. It enables us to worship and relate to Him in a more meaningful way. By gaining knowledge about His attributes, we can grow in our appreciation for who He is and how He works in our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Think About It&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take a moment to reflect on your own understanding of God. How do you perceive His attributes? Are there any misconceptions you may have about Him? Consider how studying theology proper can help you develop a more accurate and comprehensive understanding of God.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/The Nature of God/The Basics"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Discovering the Divine: What God is Really Like</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/what-is-god-like/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-05-15T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-05-15T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-05-15:/what-is-god-like/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;What is God Like?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every culture throughout history has had its own understanding of what God is like. Some have believed that God controls the weather and depicted Him as a storm god throwing lightning bolts (Baal worship in Canaan). Others worshiped the sun, considering it the most powerful entity (Ra worship in Egypt). Pantheistic beliefs saw God as being present in everything, while some turned to agnosticism or worshiped an "Unknown God" to cover all bases (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Acts/17/Acts-17-23.html"&gt;Acts 17:23&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, these assumptions only provide a partial picture of who God truly is. While it is true that God controls the weather, He also has control over much more. He is more powerful than the sun, and He transcends everything. Thankfully, even though there are aspects of God that we may not fully understand, He has revealed Himself to us through the Bible. In fact, God desires to be known (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/46/Psalm-46-10.html"&gt;Psalm 46:10&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Norman Geisler and Frank Turek, in their book "I Don't Have Enough Faith to Be an Atheist," provide some important insights into the nature of truth. They state that truth is discovered, not invented, and it exists independently of anyone's knowledge of it. Truth is also transcultural, meaning that if something is true, it applies to all people, everywhere, at all times. Furthermore, truth is unchanging even though our beliefs about truth may change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, as we seek to understand what God is like, we are simply seeking to discover truths that already exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;God's Existence&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First and foremost, the Bible asserts that God exists. It does not argue for His existence; it simply states it. The fact that God exists should be self-evident through the works He has created (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/19/Psalm-19-1.html"&gt;Psalm 19:1-6&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/1/Genesis-1-1.html"&gt;Genesis 1:1&lt;/a&gt; declares, "In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth." This simple yet powerful statement reveals that God created the entire universe, including time, space, matter, and energy, by His own decree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Albert Einstein's Theory of General Relativity affirms that all time, space, and matter had a definite, simultaneous beginning. According to the law of causality, what has a beginning has a cause. Therefore, God serves as the ultimate cause behind the existence of all things. He is not only the creator of everything but also almighty (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Joel/1/Joel-1-15.html"&gt;Joel 1:15&lt;/a&gt;), eternally self-existent (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/90/Psalm-90-2.html"&gt;Psalm 90:2&lt;/a&gt;), and beyond everything in creation (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/97/Psalm-97-9.html"&gt;Psalm 97:9&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the same God who created all things also exercises control over them. He is sovereign (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/46/Isaiah-46-10.html"&gt;Isaiah 46:10&lt;/a&gt;). A person who creates something owns it and possesses the authority to utilize it as they see fit. As &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/44/Isaiah-44-24.html"&gt;Isaiah 44:24&lt;/a&gt; states, God is the One "who has made all things, who alone stretched out the heavens, who spread out the earth by myself." The following verse emphasizes that He can overthrow the knowledge of the wise and render it meaningless. Clearly, God possesses the power to do as He pleases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Nature of God&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God is not a physical being that can be represented by any created thing. In fact, any attempt to create such a representation is considered blasphemous (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Exodus/20/Exodus-20-4.html"&gt;Exodus 20:4-6&lt;/a&gt;). Instead, God is spirit (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/4/John-4-24.html"&gt;John 4:24&lt;/a&gt;), existing in a non-physical form. He is unchanging (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Malachi/3/Malachi-3-6.html"&gt;Malachi 3:6&lt;/a&gt;), meaning His character and attributes remain constant throughout time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gs_gY1K1AMU" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;God is all-knowing (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-John/3/1-John-3-20.html"&gt;1 John 3:20&lt;/a&gt;) and present everywhere (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/139/Psalm-139-7.html"&gt;Psalm 139:7-13&lt;/a&gt;). His knowledge encompasses everything, and He is present in every corner of creation. Additionally, God is holy and glorious (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/6/Isaiah-6-3.html"&gt;Isaiah 6:3&lt;/a&gt;), meaning He is set apart and possesses an awe-inspiring majesty. He is just (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Deuteronomy/32/Deuteronomy-32-4.html"&gt;Deuteronomy 32:4&lt;/a&gt;) and will righteously judge all sin and unrighteousness (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Jude/1/Jude-1-15.html"&gt;Jude 1:15&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept of God's judgment highlights another important aspect of His nature: He is a moral being. C. S. Lewis, in his book "Mere Christianity," argues that just as there are observable laws of nature (such as gravity and entropy), there are also observable laws of morality. Lewis states, "First, that human beings, all over the earth, have this curious idea that they ought to behave in a certain way, and cannot really get rid of it. Secondly, that they do not in fact behave in that way. They know the Law of Nature; they break it." This universal belief in right and wrong reflects the nature of God who created us in His image (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/1/Genesis-1-26.html"&gt;Genesis 1:26&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Ecclesiastes/3/Ecclesiastes-3-11.html"&gt;Ecclesiastes 3:11&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Jesus Reveals God&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus Christ, during His time on Earth, provided a unique glimpse into the nature of God. He declared that anyone who had seen Him had seen the Father (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/14/John-14-7.html"&gt;John 14:7-9&lt;/a&gt;). Through Jesus, we come to understand that God seeks to save the lost (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/19/Luke-19-10.html"&gt;Luke 19:10&lt;/a&gt;). He embodies compassion (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/14/Matthew-14-14.html"&gt;Matthew 14:14&lt;/a&gt;), mercy (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/6/Luke-6-36.html"&gt;Luke 6:36&lt;/a&gt;), and forgiveness (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/9/Matthew-9-1.html"&gt;Matthew 9:1-8&lt;/a&gt;). Simultaneously, Jesus revealed that God would judge unrepentant sin (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/13/Luke-13-5.html"&gt;Luke 13:5&lt;/a&gt;) and expressed His anger towards those who lived falsely and refused to acknowledge the truth (Matthew 23).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Above all, Jesus demonstrated that God is love (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-John/4/1-John-4-8.html"&gt;1 John 4:8&lt;/a&gt;). Out of love, God sent His Son into the world (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/3/John-3-16.html"&gt;John 3:16&lt;/a&gt;), who willingly died on the cross for sinners (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/5/Romans-5-8.html"&gt;Romans 5:8&lt;/a&gt;). It is through love that God still calls sinners to repentance and offers the grace to be called children of God (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-John/3/1-John-3-1.html"&gt;1 John 3:1&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding what God is like has significant implications for our lives. Recognizing that God exists and is in control reminds us that we are not alone or without purpose. It also reaffirms our need to acknowledge Him as the ultimate authority in our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Realizing that God is a moral being helps us understand the importance of living according to His standards. It prompts us to seek righteousness and avoid sinful behaviors. Moreover, comprehending that God is love encourages us to embrace His forgiveness, grace, and mercy in our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take a moment to reflect on your understanding of God. How does your perception align with the biblical description presented here? Consider how knowing what God is like can impact your relationship with Him and shape your actions and attitudes towards others.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/The Nature of God/The Basics"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Does God Possess a Soul?

&lt;p&gt;The concept of a soul is first mentioned in the Bible in the context of the creation of Adam. In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/2/Genesis-2-7.html"&gt;Genesis 2:7&lt;/a&gt;, it states that "the LORD God formed a man from the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Does God Have a Soul?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept of a soul is first mentioned in the Bible in the context of the creation of Adam. In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/2/Genesis-2-7.html"&gt;Genesis 2:7&lt;/a&gt;, it states that "the LORD God formed a man from the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and the man became a living being" (or "a living soul" in the KJV). This shows that humans have a non-physical part known as a soul.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout Scripture, people are referred to as having a soul (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/62/Psalm-62-5.html"&gt;Psalm 62:5&lt;/a&gt;; 104:1; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/1/Luke-1-46.html"&gt;Luke 1:46&lt;/a&gt;). Since humans are created in God's image (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/1/Genesis-1-26.html"&gt;Genesis 1:26&lt;/a&gt;–27), some may wonder if this means that God also has a soul. While there are passages that indicate that God has a soul (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Leviticus/26/Leviticus-26-11.html"&gt;Leviticus 26:11&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Judges/10/Judges-10-16.html"&gt;Judges 10:16&lt;/a&gt;), we must be cautious in interpreting these verses. Scripture often uses anthropomorphism, attributing human qualities to God in a figurative sense. Just as God is described as having hands or a face, it could be that biblical descriptions of God's "soul" are also anthropomorphisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/b8UmAQq6n7A" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is important to note that Scripture does not explicitly state that God has a soul. God is Spirit (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/4/John-4-24.html"&gt;John 4:24&lt;/a&gt;), but nowhere does it say that He is Soul or that He possesses a soul. However, when we consider Jesus, who is fully God and fully man, we can be more certain. In His incarnation, Jesus took on a sinless human nature, which included a truly human soul. In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/26/Matthew-26-38.html"&gt;Matthew 26:38&lt;/a&gt;, during His agony in the Garden of Gethsemane, Jesus said, "My soul is overwhelmed with sorrow to the point of death." This indicates that Jesus had a distinct human soul that experienced emotions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The definition of the word "soul" plays a significant role in this discussion. If we equate the word soul with personhood, then it can be said that God has a soul because He possesses a mind, emotions, and a will. If we define the soul as the ability to express emotions, then God also has a soul. However, in the context of humanity, the word soul is often understood as the immaterial part that connects the spirit and the body. In this sense, God does not have a human-like soul because He is Spirit and not human.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding whether God has a soul or not may seem like a theological curiosity, but it has practical implications. It helps us grasp the nature of God and His relationship with us as His creation. By recognizing that humans have souls created in the image of God, we can better understand our own identity and purpose. Additionally, recognizing Jesus' fully human nature allows us to appreciate the depth of His sacrifice on the cross and His ability to empathize with our human experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does the concept of God having a soul or not impact your understanding of His nature?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What does it mean for you as a believer to have a soul created in the image of God?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reflect on Jesus' humanity and His ability to relate to our experiences. How does this impact your relationship with Him?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, while Scripture does not explicitly state that God has a soul, it does refer to people having souls and describes God using anthropomorphic language. Jesus, being fully God and fully man, possessed a human soul. The definition of "soul" is crucial in understanding this topic, as it affects how we perceive God's nature and our own identity as His creation. Recognizing Jesus' humanity allows us to appreciate His sacrifice and relate to Him on a deeper level.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/The Nature of God/The Basics"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Discovering the True Nature of God: A Comprehensive Guide for Christian Believers</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/what-is-god/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-04-26T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-04-26T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-04-26:/what-is-god/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;What is God?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A. W. Tozer rightly pointed …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;What is God?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Points:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;God's nature is beyond human comprehension.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;God revealed Himself as "I AM WHO I AM."&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;God is a self-existent and necessary being.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;God is personal and has a purpose.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;God is a Triune being.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;God is love.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;God's Incomprehensible Nature&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A. W. Tozer rightly pointed out that we cannot fully comprehend what God is like in Himself. The book of Job asks, "Can you discover the depths of God? Can you discover the limits of the Almighty?" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Job/11/Job-11-7.html"&gt;Job 11:7-8&lt;/a&gt;). However, while we cannot fully comprehend God's essence, He has revealed aspects of Himself that we can understand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;"I AM WHO I AM"&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Moses asked God what His name was, God replied, "I AM WHO I AM" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Exodus/3/Exodus-3-14.html"&gt;Exodus 3:14&lt;/a&gt;). This name signifies that God is pure existence or pure actuality. He is the only one who can say, "I be that I be." While many things have existence, only God is Being itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Self-Existence and First Cause&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QPywCD-TSd0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;God is a self-existent being and the first cause of everything else that exists. He has life in Himself (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/5/John-5-26.html"&gt;John 5:26&lt;/a&gt;) and does not depend on anything or anyone else for His existence (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Acts/17/Acts-17-25.html"&gt;Acts 17:25&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Necessary Being&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God is a necessary being, meaning His nonexistence is impossible. All other things are contingent beings, meaning they could not exist without Him. If God did not exist, nothing else would exist either (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Job/34/Job-34-14.html"&gt;Job 34:14-15&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Personal and Purposeful&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God is a personal being with intent and will. He has a purpose, creates, and directs events according to His plan (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/46/Isaiah-46-9.html"&gt;Isaiah 46:9-10&lt;/a&gt;). While the word "personal" doesn't refer to personality traits, it emphasizes that God has intentions and acts purposefully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Triune Nature of God&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bible affirms that there is only one God (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Deuteronomy/6/Deuteronomy-6-4.html"&gt;Deuteronomy 6:4&lt;/a&gt;), but it also reveals a plurality within the Godhead. Jesus commanded His disciples to baptize in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/28/Matthew-28-19.html"&gt;Matthew 28:19&lt;/a&gt;). This indicates a unity and diversity within the Godhead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout Scripture, the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are referred to as God. Jesus is described as the first cause of everything and possessing self-existence (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/1/John-1-3.html"&gt;John 1:3-4&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Colossians/1/Colossians-1-17.html"&gt;Colossians 1:17&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;God is Love&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/4/John-4-8.html"&gt;John 4:8&lt;/a&gt; simply states, "God is love." While many things can possess and experience love, only God is love itself. This aspect of God's nature is fundamental to understanding His character and His relationship with humanity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding what God is like helps us develop a more accurate view of Him and deepens our relationship with Him. Recognizing His self-existence and necessary being helps us grasp His sovereignty and understand that He is the ultimate source of all life. Knowing that God is personal and purposeful assures us that He has intentions for our lives and directs events according to His plan. Recognizing the triune nature of God helps us comprehend how He can be both one and yet exist in a relational community. Understanding that God is love allows us to experience His love more fully and reflect that love in our relationships with others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Think About It&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does understanding God's nature as self-existent and necessary impact your view of His sovereignty?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In what ways does recognizing God as personal and purposeful affect your understanding of His involvement in your life?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does contemplating the triune nature of God deepen your appreciation for the complexity and unity within the Godhead?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reflect on the statement "God is love." How does this reality impact your understanding of His character and His love for you?&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, God is a person, but it's important to understand that when we say "person," we don't mean that God is a human being. Instead, we mean that God possesses a personality and is a rational being with self-awareness. The Bible teaches that God exists in …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Is God a Person?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, God is a person, but it's important to understand that when we say "person," we don't mean that God is a human being. Instead, we mean that God possesses a personality and is a rational being with self-awareness. The Bible teaches that God exists in three Persons: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Nature of God as a Person&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we talk about God being a person, we are referring to an individual being with a mind, emotions, and a will. Just like humans, God has intellect, emotions, and volition. For example, the Bible tells us that God has intellect by stating that His thoughts are vast and incomprehensible (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/139/Psalm-139-17.html"&gt;Psalm 139:17&lt;/a&gt;). It also describes His emotions, such as anger (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/78/Psalm-78-41.html"&gt;Psalm 78:41&lt;/a&gt;), and His will, which is evident in His commandments and instructions (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-Corinthians/1/1-Corinthians-1-1.html"&gt;1 Corinthians 1:1&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Tri-Unity of God&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept of the tri-unity of God can be challenging to grasp, but it is supported by biblical evidence. In various passages of the Bible, we see references to the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit as distinct Persons in the Trinity. For instance, &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/48/Isaiah-48-16.html"&gt;Isaiah 48:16&lt;/a&gt; and 61:1 depict the Son speaking while making reference to the Father and the Holy Spirit. In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/4/Luke-4-14.html"&gt;Luke 4:14&lt;/a&gt;–19, Jesus also refers to Himself as anointed by the Holy Spirit. Additionally, &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/3/Matthew-3-16.html"&gt;Matthew 3:16&lt;/a&gt;–17 describes Jesus' baptism where God the Holy Spirit descends on God the Son while the Father proclaims His pleasure in the Son. Other verses like &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/28/Matthew-28-19.html"&gt;Matthew 28:19&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/2-Corinthians/13/2-Corinthians-13-14.html"&gt;2 Corinthians 13:14&lt;/a&gt; further emphasize the existence of three distinct Persons in the Trinity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ITEzXLcpKZs" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The Personhood of Each Member of the Trinity&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each person of the Trinity—Father, Son, and Holy Spirit—exhibits personal characteristics. God the Father possesses a mind, emotions, and a will. His thoughts and ways are higher than ours (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/55/Isaiah-55-8.html"&gt;Isaiah 55:8&lt;/a&gt;–9). He experiences emotions like compassion (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/78/Psalm-78-40.html"&gt;Psalm 78:40&lt;/a&gt;) and has a will that is expressed through His commandments and plans (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-Peter/2/1-Peter-2-15.html"&gt;1 Peter 2:15&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, God the Son, Jesus Christ, is also a person. He has a mind, emotions, and a will. During His earthly life, Jesus grew in wisdom and knowledge (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/2/Luke-2-52.html"&gt;Luke 2:52&lt;/a&gt;), experienced emotions like sadness (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/11/John-11-35.html"&gt;John 11:35&lt;/a&gt;), and expressed His will when He prayed to the Father (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/22/Luke-22-42.html"&gt;Luke 22:42&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God the Holy Spirit is also a person with a mind, emotions, and a will. The Holy Spirit intercedes for believers according to God's will (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/8/Romans-8-27.html"&gt;Romans 8:27&lt;/a&gt;), can be grieved by our actions (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Ephesians/4/Ephesians-4-30.html"&gt;Ephesians 4:30&lt;/a&gt;), and has a will that can be resisted (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Galatians/5/Galatians-5-17.html"&gt;Galatians 5:17&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;God's Personal Nature&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God's personal nature is evident in the way He interacts with humanity. Throughout the Bible, we find numerous examples of God expressing anger, laughter, compassion, love, hatred, teaching, reproving, and leading. All of these actions imply that God is indeed a person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding that God is a person with personality helps us relate to Him on a deeper level. It reminds us that we have been created in His image and that we can develop a personal relationship with Him. Recognizing God's personhood also helps us appreciate His attributes and character more fully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Think About It&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider how different your perception of God would be if you didn't view Him as a person. How does recognizing God's personhood impact your understanding of His love, care, and involvement in your life? Take a moment to reflect on the personal nature of God and how it affects your relationship with Him.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/The Nature of God/The Basics"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry></feed>

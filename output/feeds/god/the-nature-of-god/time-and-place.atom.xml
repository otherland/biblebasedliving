&lt;p&gt;The Bible teaches that God is omnipresent, which means that He is present everywhere at all times. In Psalm 139, David acknowledges this truth by asking, "Where can I go from your Spirit? Where can I flee from your presence?" He then goes on to describe how …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Presence and Omnipresence&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bible teaches that God is omnipresent, which means that He is present everywhere at all times. In Psalm 139, David acknowledges this truth by asking, "Where can I go from your Spirit? Where can I flee from your presence?" He then goes on to describe how even if he were to ascend to the heavens or descend to the depths of the sea, God would be there. This demonstrates that no matter where we go, God is always with us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Acts 17, the apostle Paul also affirms God's omnipresence when he says, "He is not far from any one of us. 'For in him we live and move and have our being.'" This highlights the fact that God's presence encompasses everything and everyone. Even though we may not always be aware of His presence, He is constantly near us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, there is another sense in which we can either be in or out of God's "presence." In this context, the presence of God refers to His divine blessing and embracing love. The children of God are promised to experience everlasting joy in His presence. As &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/16/Psalm-16-11.html"&gt;Psalm 16:11&lt;/a&gt; states, "You will fill me with joy in your presence, with eternal pleasures at your right hand." This indicates that being in God's presence brings about a sense of joy and fulfillment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, those who reject the gospel will be punished with everlasting destruction and shut out from the presence of the Lord. This separation from God's presence is a consequence of their rejection of Him. It is important to note that this punishment is not merely physical but also spiritual, as it involves being eternally separated from the glory and might of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The presence of God can also refer to a place of honor. Just as it is a privilege to stand in the presence of a king, standing in the presence of God carries great honor and significance. In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/1/Luke-1-19.html"&gt;Luke 1:19&lt;/a&gt;, the angel Gabriel describes himself as one who stands in the presence of God. This indicates that being in the presence of God is a position of honor and authority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the presence of God can also be associated with the demonstration of overwhelming glory and heavenly majesty. When Isaiah had his vision of God on His throne, he described the seraphim as being unable to view God's glory directly. This demonstrates that the presence of God is awe-inspiring and humbling for sinful humanity to approach. It emphasizes the holiness and majesty of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The presence of God can also refer to a unique revelation of Himself to humanity. Throughout history, God has chosen specific locations or events to reveal His presence to His people. For example, Moses encountered God's presence at the burning bush, and later, God revealed Himself at Mount Sinai. These instances highlight how God chooses to manifest His presence in specific ways for the purpose of communicating with His people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to distinguish between God's omnipresence, which is His all-pervading presence, and His manifest presence, which refers to His overt and unmistakable interaction with us. While God is always present everywhere, there are times when He chooses to manifest His presence in a more tangible way so that we can recognize and experience Him more deeply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the concept of God's omnipresence and manifest presence is significant for our relationship with Him. Recognizing that God is always with us brings comfort, assurance, and a sense of security. We can find solace in knowing that we are never alone, even in our most challenging moments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cnVFbQOwdZE" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Knowing that God's presence carries blessings and joy encourages us to seek after Him and cultivate a deeper connection with Him. It reminds us that true fulfillment and happiness are found in His presence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, understanding the honor and awe associated with being in the presence of God helps us approach Him with reverence and respect. It reminds us of His holiness and the need for repentance and humility in His presence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take a moment to reflect on the concept of God's omnipresence. How does knowing that God is always with you impact your daily life?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider the privilege of being in the presence of God. How does this perspective change the way you approach Him in prayer, worship, and obedience?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reflect on the manifestations of God's presence throughout history. How have these instances deepened your understanding of God's character and His desire to communicate with His people?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The infinite nature of God is a fundamental aspect of His being. It refers to the fact that God exists outside of and is not limited by time or space. When we say that God is infinite, we are acknowledging that He is without limits. This concept is often associated with terms like omniscience, omnipotence, and omnipresence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Omniscience: God's Unlimited Knowledge&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One aspect of God's infinite nature is His omniscience, which means that He is all-knowing. God has unlimited knowledge and nothing takes Him by surprise. He knows everything that has happened, is happening, and will happen. Not only does God know all things that will occur in the future, but He also knows all things that could have possibly happened. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think About It: God's infinite knowledge means that He is the sovereign ruler and judge over all things. He sees and understands everything, including our thoughts and intentions. This should remind us to live in reverence and awe of Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Omnipotence: God's Unlimited Power&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God's infinite nature also includes His omnipotence, which means that He is all-powerful. His power is unlimited, and there is nothing that can stop His decreed will from happening. Nothing can thwart or stop His divine purposes from being fulfilled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think About It: God's infinite power gives us confidence in His ability to carry out His sovereign will. We can trust that He is in control and working all things together for the good of those who love Him (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/8/Romans-8-28.html"&gt;Romans 8:28&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Omnipresence: God's Ever-Present Nature&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another aspect of God's infinite nature is His omnipresence, which means that He is always present. There is no place where we can go to escape God's presence. He exists at every point in time and space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think About It: God's infinite presence assures us that we are never alone. He is with us always, guiding us and holding us in His hand. We can find comfort and security in knowing that He is near.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/x7ogV49WGco" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Transcendence: God's Exceeding Greatness&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because God is infinite, He is also said to be transcendent. This means that He is exceedingly far above creation and greater than it. God is independent of His creation, and He surpasses our ability to fully comprehend Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think About It: Our finite minds cannot fully grasp the greatness of God. However, He has revealed Himself to us through creation, our conscience, the Bible, and Jesus Christ. Through His revelation, we can know God and understand His will for our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters: Understanding God's Infinite Nature&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding and embracing the infinite nature of God is vital for our faith and relationship with Him. It reminds us of His sovereignty, power, and presence. It encourages us to trust in His plans and purposes. It also humbles us, acknowledging that we are finite beings in need of a limitless God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It: Our Infinite God&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we reflect on the infinite nature of God, let us marvel at His greatness and embrace His revelation. Let us seek to know Him more deeply and to live in awe of His majesty. May we find comfort and peace in His omnipresence and trust in His unlimited power. And may we live our lives in a way that honors and glorifies our infinite God.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/The Nature of God/Time and Place"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Discover the Unwavering Presence of God: A Guide for Christian Believers</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/god-omnipresent/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-07-30T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-07-30T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-07-30:/god-omnipresent/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;God's Omnipresence&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The concept of God's omnipresence is rooted in Latin, with the prefix "omni" meaning "all." When we say that God is omnipresent, we mean that God is present everywhere. In Christianity and Judaism, the belief in God's omnipresence is further divided into transcendence and immanence. Transcendence refers to the idea that God is not fully immersed in the fabric of creation (pantheism), but rather exists beyond it. Immanence, on the other hand, emphasizes that God is present everywhere at all times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Understanding God's omnipresence helps us develop a deeper appreciation for His immeasurable power and influence. It reminds us that we are never alone and that God is always with us, regardless of our circumstances. Recognizing His presence can provide comfort, guidance, and assurance in our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; Reflect on moments when you have felt God's presence in your life. How did it affect you? How can remembering His omnipresence impact your daily life and relationship with Him?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Continuous Presence&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God's presence is continuous throughout all of creation, although it may not be revealed in the same way at the same time to everyone. Sometimes, He may actively manifest His presence in a situation, while in other circumstances, He may not reveal Himself. The Bible teaches that God can be both manifestly present to individuals (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/46/Psalm-46-1.html"&gt;Psalm 46:1&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/57/Isaiah-57-15.html"&gt;Isaiah 57:15&lt;/a&gt;) and present in every situation within creation at any given time (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/33/Psalm-33-13.html"&gt;Psalm 33:13-14&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; Consider moments when you have recognized God's manifest presence in your life or the lives of others. How did it impact your faith or understanding of Him? Reflect on how His continuous presence in all of creation can bring hope and encouragement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Omnipresence in Time and Space&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VEfRuQpInJE" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;God's omnipresence means that He is present in all ranges of both time and space. He is not limited by any specific location or moment. God is everywhere, encompassing every now. No particle is too small for His presence, and no galaxy is too vast for Him to encompass. Even if we were to remove creation, God would still be aware of it, as He knows all possibilities, whether actualized or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Understanding God's omnipresence in time and space highlights His sovereignty and power over the universe. It reminds us that there is nowhere we can go where God is not already present, and that He is intimately aware of every aspect of our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; Reflect on how knowing that God is present in every moment and place can bring a sense of peace and security. How does this truth impact your perspective on life's challenges and uncertainties?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;God's Presence in Creation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God is naturally present in every aspect of the natural world, at all times and in all places (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/40/Isaiah-40-12.html"&gt;Isaiah 40:12&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Nahum/1/Nahum-1-3.html"&gt;Nahum 1:3&lt;/a&gt;). He is actively present in every event throughout history, guiding human affairs (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/48/Psalm-48-7.html"&gt;Psalm 48:7&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/2-Chronicles/20/2-Chronicles-20-37.html"&gt;2 Chronicles 20:37&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Daniel/5/Daniel-5-5.html"&gt;Daniel 5:5-6&lt;/a&gt;). Additionally, God is specially attentive to those who call upon His name, intercede for others, adore Him, petition Him, and earnestly seek forgiveness (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/46/Psalm-46-1.html"&gt;Psalm 46:1&lt;/a&gt;). His presence is supremely manifested in His Son, Jesus Christ (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Colossians/2/Colossians-2-19.html"&gt;Colossians 2:19&lt;/a&gt;), and mystically present in the universal Church that spans the earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Recognizing God's presence in creation helps us understand that He is actively involved in our lives and has a plan for each one of us. It also encourages us to seek a deeper relationship with Him through prayer, worship, and fellowship with other believers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; Consider how you can cultivate a greater awareness of God's presence in your daily life. How can you actively seek His guidance and depend on His strength in every situation?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Paradox of God's Presence&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as the concept of God's omniscience presents paradoxes due to our limited human understanding, so does the notion of His omnipresence. One significant paradox is the presence of God in hell, the place where the wicked are said to suffer the eternal fury of God due to their sin. Some argue that hell is a place of separation from God (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/25/Matthew-25-41.html"&gt;Matthew 25:41&lt;/a&gt;), which would suggest that God cannot be present in a place separated from Him. However, &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Revelation/14/Revelation-14-10.html"&gt;Revelation 14:10&lt;/a&gt; speaks of the torment of the wicked in the presence of the Lamb. This paradox can be explained by recognizing that God can be present even in those places separated from His blessings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; Reflect on the tension between God's presence in both heaven and hell. How does this paradox challenge your understanding of His character? Consider how it deepens your appreciation for His justice and mercy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Returning to God&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While God is present everywhere, sin can create a separation between us and Him (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/52/Isaiah-52-9.html"&gt;Isaiah 52:9&lt;/a&gt;). He is far from the wicked (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Proverbs/15/Proverbs-15-29.html"&gt;Proverbs 15:29&lt;/a&gt;) and has ordained that the godless will depart to a place of eternal punishment. Yet, even in these instances, God remains present. He knows the suffering experienced by those in hell, their anguish, cries for respite, tears, and grief over their eternal state. His perpetual presence serves as a constant reminder of their sin and the chasm it creates between them and every possible blessing. However, through repentance and faith, we can return to God without having to physically move (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/57/Isaiah-57-16.html"&gt;Isaiah 57:16&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Recognizing that God is present even in times of separation and punishment reveals His love for us and His desire for reconciliation. It reminds us that no matter how far we may have strayed, we can always turn to Him and find forgiveness and restoration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; Consider the incredible grace of God that allows us to return to Him despite our sinfulness. How does this truth impact your view of yourself and others? How does it encourage you to extend grace and forgiveness to those around you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, the concept of God's omnipresence teaches us that He is present everywhere at all times. His presence is continuous throughout creation, yet He can manifest Himself in different ways to different people. God's omnipresence extends to all ranges of time and space, emphasizing His sovereignty over the universe. He is present in nature, history, and the lives of individuals, manifesting His love, guidance, and power. Even in places of separation or punishment, God's presence remains, reminding us of His justice and mercy. Understanding God's omnipresence can deepen our faith, provide comfort in difficult times, and inspire us to seek a closer relationship with Him.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/The Nature of God/Time and Place"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>The Divine Immanence: Understanding God's Presence in Christianity</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/immanence-of-god/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-07-30T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-07-30T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-07-30:/immanence-of-god/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;The Immanence of God&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The concept of the immanence of God refers to His presence within His creation. It is the belief that God is present in all aspects of His creation while remaining distinct from it. This should not be confused with the timing of Jesus' return to earth. The immanence of God emphasizes that there is no place where God is not present. He exercises His sovereign control over all things simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Understanding Immanence&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To better understand the immanence of God, it is important to differentiate it from other belief systems that may distort our understanding. Pantheism, for example, teaches that everything is God or a part of God. In this view, God is considered equal to His creation and unable to act upon it. Deism, on the other hand, acknowledges that God is distinct from His creation but denies His active involvement in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wL8VCCLeNvU" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Contrary to these false views, the Bible teaches that God is both different from His creation and actively upholds it. The attributes of transcendence and immanence are both ascribed to God. &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Jeremiah/23/Jeremiah-23-23.html"&gt;Jeremiah 23:23&lt;/a&gt; tells us that He is both "nearby" and "far away." &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/55/Isaiah-55-9.html"&gt;Isaiah 55:9&lt;/a&gt; states, "As the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts." This highlights God's transcendence. Additionally, &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Colossians/1/Colossians-1-17.html"&gt;Colossians 1:17&lt;/a&gt; declares that "in him all things hold together," illustrating His immanence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;God's Omnipresence&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept of God's omnipresence closely relates to His immanence. &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/139/Psalm-139-1.html"&gt;Psalm 139:1-10&lt;/a&gt; beautifully describes this attribute in detail. In the New Testament, Paul affirms that God Himself gives life and breath to all and that in Him we live, move, and have our being (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Acts/17/Acts-17-25.html"&gt;Acts 17:25&lt;/a&gt;, 28). These verses emphasize how God guides, governs, and provides for His creation while remaining above it (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Ephesians/1/Ephesians-1-11.html"&gt;Ephesians 1:11&lt;/a&gt;; 4:6).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Immanence of God in Scripture&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bible as a whole supports the idea of God's immanence. The very existence of God's Word in written form testifies to His interest and action in the world. The survival of Israel throughout biblical history and the Incarnation of Jesus are powerful examples of God's presence and involvement. &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/1/Hebrews-1-3.html"&gt;Hebrews 1:3&lt;/a&gt; affirms that God is "sustaining all things by His powerful word." Furthermore, Jesus is referred to as Immanuel, which means "God with us." This title highlights the immanence of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the immanence of God has significant implications for our faith and relationship with Him. It reminds us that God is not distant or detached from His creation but actively involved in every aspect of our lives. This understanding can bring comfort, knowing that we are never alone, and that God is intimately aware of our needs and circumstances. It also calls us to recognize and appreciate the presence of God in everyday life, leading us to worship and depend on Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reflecting on the immanence of God encourages us to consider our perspective of Him. Do we view Him as a distant deity or as an intimately involved Creator? How does our understanding of God's immanence impact our daily lives? How can we cultivate a greater awareness of His presence and seek to align ourselves with His will? Taking time to ponder these questions can deepen our faith and transform our relationship with God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, the immanence of God emphasizes His presence within His creation while remaining distinct from it. It is a concept supported by Scripture and highlights both God's transcendence and immanence. Understanding God's immanence has practical implications for our faith and calls us to recognize and appreciate His continuous presence in our lives.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/The Nature of God/Time and Place"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Divine Revelation: How God Knows the Future Unfolding</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/god-know-future/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-07-01T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-07-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-07-01:/god-know-future/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;God's Knowledge of the Future&lt;/h2&gt;

This fulfillment demonstrates the accuracy and reliability of the Bible's prophetic claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peter Stoner, in his book "Science Speaks," has shown that the probability of coincidence in prophetic Scripture is extremely low. By examining just eight prophecies concerning Christ, Stoner found that the chance of any one man fulfilling all eight prophecies is 1 in 10 to the 17th power. That would be 1 chance in 100,000,000,000,000,000. Considering Jesus fulfilled many more than just eight prophecies, it is evident that the Bible accurately foretells the future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bible declares that God has the ability to foretell the future. &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/46/Isaiah-46-9.html"&gt;Isaiah 46:9-10&lt;/a&gt; states, "Remember the former things long past, for I am God, and there is no other; I am God and there is no one like Me, declaring the end from the beginning, and from ancient times things which have not been done, saying, 'My purpose will be established, and I will accomplish all My good pleasure.'" This passage emphasizes that God is unmatched in His ability to declare the end from the beginning. He can stand at the start and accurately predict what will happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God possesses omniscience; He knows everything that is actual and possible. Additionally, God is eternal (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/90/Psalm-90-2.html"&gt;Psalm 90:2&lt;/a&gt;). As an eternal and omniscient being, He has experienced our past, present, and future. He is the Alpha and Omega, the Beginning and the End (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Revelation/21/Revelation-21-6.html"&gt;Revelation 21:6&lt;/a&gt;). This means that God has complete knowledge of all time periods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there are still prophecies in the Bible that await fulfillment, we can trust that they will come to pass because God knows the future. Events are unfolding according to His plan and timing. As believers, we can take comfort in knowing that the one true, personal, eternal, and all-knowing God of the Bible holds the future in His hands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding God's knowledge of the future is crucial because it assures us of His sovereignty and trustworthiness. It demonstrates that God has a plan for our lives and for the world as a whole. This knowledge helps us navigate through uncertain times with confidence, knowing that God is in control. It also encourages us to seek His guidance and trust in His promises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does the fact that God knows the future impact your perspective on life's uncertainties?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does God's ability to accurately predict the future strengthen your faith in Him?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can you think of any other biblical prophecies that have been fulfilled? How does this reinforce your belief in the accuracy of God's word?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In what ways can understanding God's knowledge of the future bring comfort and hope in challenging times?&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The concept of an eternal God refers to a being who has no beginning and no end. In the Bible, we are told that God is eternal, existing from everlasting to everlasting (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/90/Psalm-90-2.html"&gt;Psalm 90:2&lt;/a&gt;). This means that God has always been, and will continue to exist forever …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Eternal God&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept of an eternal God refers to a being who has no beginning and no end. In the Bible, we are told that God is eternal, existing from everlasting to everlasting (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/90/Psalm-90-2.html"&gt;Psalm 90:2&lt;/a&gt;). This means that God has always been, and will continue to exist forever. It can be difficult for us, as humans who measure everything in time, to fully grasp the idea of something that has no beginning or end. However, the Bible simply starts with the statement "In the beginning God..." (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/1/Genesis-1-1.html"&gt;Genesis 1:1&lt;/a&gt;), implying that God already existed at the start of recorded time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Self-Existence of God&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Moses asked God what His name was, God replied, "I AM WHO I AM" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Exodus/3/Exodus-3-14.html"&gt;Exodus 3:14&lt;/a&gt;). This name signifies the real being of God, His self-existence. It means that He is the Being of beings and describes His eternality, immutability, and constancy in fulfilling His promises. The name "I AM" encompasses all time—past, present, and future. It emphasizes that not only is God what He is at present, but He has always been and will always be. This declaration from God Himself speaks to us through the pages of Scripture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Jesus Christ: The Eternal God Incarnate&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus Christ, as the incarnation of God, also affirmed His deity and eternality during His time on Earth. He declared to the people, "Before Abraham was born, I AM" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/8/John-8-58.html"&gt;John 8:58&lt;/a&gt;). By making this statement, Jesus was claiming to be God in human form. The Jews considered this blasphemy and sought to stone Him to death because declaring oneself to be the eternal God was seen as a grave offense. The apostle John further affirmed this truth about Jesus' nature when he wrote, "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/1/John-1-1.html"&gt;John 1:1&lt;/a&gt;). Jesus and His Father are one in essence, existing outside of time, and equally sharing the attribute of eternality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Creation Reveals God's Eternality&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_z6JL9eL_LQ" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/1/Romans-1-20.html"&gt;Romans 1:20&lt;/a&gt; tells us that God's eternal nature and power are evident through His creation. When we observe the natural world, we can see evidence of God's eternality. The sun and the heavenly bodies continue in their predictable orbits, season after season comes and goes, and trees produce leaves in spring and shed them in the fall. These consistent patterns testify to God's eternal power and plan for the Earth. Just as creation continues on its course, one day, God will create a new heaven and a new earth that will also endure for eternity. As believers in Christ, we will share in this eternal existence with our God, as we are created in His image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding God's eternality is essential because it reveals His infinite nature and sovereignty over all things. Recognizing that He has no beginning or end helps us grasp His timeless wisdom, love, and faithfulness. It reassures us that He is in control of our lives and has a plan that extends beyond our earthly existence. Knowing that Jesus Christ is the eternal God incarnate gives us confidence in His ability to save us and provide eternal life through faith in Him. It also challenges our understanding of time and encourages us to trust in God's perspective rather than our limited human understanding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take a moment to reflect on the concept of eternity. How does understanding God's eternality impact your view of Him? How does it influence your perspective on time? In what ways can you rely on God's timeless wisdom and love in your daily life? Consider how embracing the eternal nature of Christ can shape your faith and give you hope for the future.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/The Nature of God/Time and Place"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Revealing God's Presence in Hell: A Christian Perspective</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/god-in-hell/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-05-24T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-05-24T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-05-24:/god-in-hell/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;God in Hell&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hell is a topic that has captured the curiosity and imagination of many throughout history. People often wonder about the nature of hell and whether or not God is present there. In this article, we will explore this question from a biblical perspective and seek to gain a deeper understanding of the relationship between God and hell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Omnipresence of God&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To begin our exploration, it is important to establish the concept of God's omnipresence. The Bible teaches that God is everywhere present. He is not confined to a specific location but fills the entirety of creation with His presence. &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/139/Psalm-139-7.html"&gt;Psalm 139:7-12&lt;/a&gt; beautifully expresses this truth, stating that no matter where we go, even to the depths of Sheol (which can be understood as the grave or the place of the dead), God is still there with us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is crucial to note that while God is present everywhere, His presence does not guarantee a relationship or fellowship with Him. This distinction becomes significant when considering the nature of hell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Hell as Separation from God&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ykt3e1x6Z_U" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hell is commonly understood as a place of punishment for those who reject Jesus Christ as their Savior. It is described as a place where people are removed from the presence of God (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/25/Matthew-25-41.html"&gt;Matthew 25:41&lt;/a&gt;). While God is omnipresent and aware of what transpires in hell, those who reside there do not have a relationship or communication with Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This concept can be challenging to grasp, as it seems contradictory for God to be present in hell while also being separated from it. However, by examining specific passages in the Bible, we can gain further insight into this apparent paradox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Different Terminology, Different Meanings&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two passages shed light on this topic: &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/2-Thessalonians/1/2-Thessalonians-1-7.html"&gt;2 Thessalonians 1:7-9&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Revelation/14/Revelation-14-10.html"&gt;Revelation 14:10&lt;/a&gt;. These verses initially appear to contradict each other regarding the presence of God in hell. However, a closer examination reveals that the original Greek language used in these passages offers a solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Revelation/14/Revelation-14-10.html"&gt;Revelation 14:10&lt;/a&gt;, the word "presence" is a literal translation of the Greek word "enopion," which implies spatial proximity. It suggests a measurable distance between God and those who are tormented. On the other hand, in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/2-Thessalonians/1/2-Thessalonians-1-7.html"&gt;2 Thessalonians 1:7-9&lt;/a&gt;, the word "presence" is translated from the Greek term "prosopon," which primarily refers to a person's face or outward appearance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drawing from these distinctions, we can understand that while God may be spatially present in hell, His favor and fellowship are entirely absent. Hell becomes a place of complete separation from the blessings and wholeness that come from being in communion with God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the presence of God in hell has significant implications for our understanding of His justice and righteousness. God's omnipresence necessitates that He knows what occurs in hell, and His justice demands punishment for those who reject Him. The existence of hell serves as a testament to God's justice, as it is the consequence of rejecting the salvation offered through Jesus Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, recognizing the separation between God and hell emphasizes the importance of choosing a relationship with Him in this life. The Bible repeatedly urges us to seek God, accept His grace, and trust in Jesus for salvation to avoid the eternal separation from Him that hell represents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contemplating the presence of God in hell can evoke several questions and reflections:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does the idea of God's omnipresence influence your understanding of His character and attributes?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does the concept of hell challenge your view of God's love and justice? How do you reconcile these seemingly conflicting aspects?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What does it mean to have a relationship with God? How does this understanding impact your choices and priorities in life?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does knowing that God is present in hell, yet separated from it, affect your appreciation for the salvation offered through Jesus Christ?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we grapple with these questions, it is essential to approach the topic of God in hell with humility and reverence. While we may not fully comprehend the complexities of this subject, we can trust in the wisdom and righteousness of God, who holds all things in His hands.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/The Nature of God/Time and Place"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Eternal Mysteries Unveiled: How Old is God According to the Bible</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/how-old-is-god/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-05-24T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-05-24T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-05-24:/how-old-is-god/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;How Old is God?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Age is a concept that measures the span from beginning to end. We determine age based on birthdays, counting the time that has passed since a person's birth. However, when it comes to God, we cannot assign Him an age because He did not have a beginning. God exists outside of time, so the question "how old is God?" doesn't apply to Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God created time as part of this universe to mark the passing of seasons and years for us (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/1/Genesis-1-14.html"&gt;Genesis 1:14&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/104/Psalm-104-19.html"&gt;Psalm 104:19&lt;/a&gt;). But He Himself is not subject to time. In the New Testament, God describes Himself as "the alpha and omega, the beginning and the end" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Revelation/1/Revelation-1-8.html"&gt;Revelation 1:8&lt;/a&gt;, 11; 22:13). This means that God is always present at all times. There is no past or future with God; everything is as though it were occurring right now. This can be difficult for us to comprehend as we are bound by time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When God revealed Himself to Moses, He said His name was "I AM WHO I AM" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Exodus/3/Exodus-3-14.html"&gt;Exodus 3:14&lt;/a&gt;). From these Hebrew words, we derive the more familiar name for God: YAHWEH. By calling Himself "I AM," God was teaching Moses that He was incomparable and self-sufficient. Time cannot confine or define God. He has always been and always will be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asking "how old is God?" is an example of a category mistake—imputing a quality to something that properly belongs only to things of another category. Other category mistakes can be seen in questions such as "how long has this gravel been dead?" (it was never alive) or "what does the color orange sound like?" (colors are not sensed audibly). The question assumes that God should be categorized as having age, but He is timeless and does not belong in the same category as things subject to time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus, who is God in human form, had a physical birth on earth around the year 5 BC. However, this was simply the incarnation of the eternal Son of God, who exists outside of time. The Lord existed before His physical incarnation. In fact, the Bible states that the earth was created by Him and through Him (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Colossians/1/Colossians-1-16.html"&gt;Colossians 1:16&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/1/John-1-1.html"&gt;John 1:1&lt;/a&gt;–3). Before Abraham was born, Jesus said, "I am" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/8/John-8-58.html"&gt;John 8:58&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary, God does not have an age because He is timeless. He is eternal (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/21/Genesis-21-33.html"&gt;Genesis 21:33&lt;/a&gt;) and holds the universe together. Without Him, nothing would exist (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/1/John-1-3.html"&gt;John 1:3&lt;/a&gt;). If God had an age, it would mean He had a beginning and there was a time when there was no God, which is impossible. Because God has always been, we can trust that He will always be, and the future is secure for those who put their trust in Him (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/9/Psalm-9-10.html"&gt;Psalm 9:10&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Proverbs/30/Proverbs-30-5.html"&gt;Proverbs 30:5&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/m8CPx66Jz6M" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding that God is timeless and exists outside of time helps us recognize His incomparable nature. It reminds us that He is not limited by temporal constraints like we are. This knowledge can deepen our trust in Him and give us confidence in His promises. It also encourages us to approach God with humility and reverence, recognizing His eternal existence and supreme authority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does the concept of God being timeless impact your understanding of His nature?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What implications does it have for your relationship with Him?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does recognizing God's eternal existence affect your trust in His plans for your life?&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our human minds struggle to comprehend the existence of God before the creation of the universe. However, the Bible provides some insight into what God was doing during this time. It reveals that before time began, God existed in three Persons: the Father, the Son (Jesus Christ), and the Holy Spirit. In this article, we will explore what God was doing before creation and how this information impacts our understanding of Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1. The Trinity in Eternity Past&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before the universe came into existence, God existed in perfect harmony and flawlessness as the Trinity. The Father, Son, and Holy Spirit were together in fellowship with one another from all eternity. They loved each other deeply and experienced complete joy. Just as David stated in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalms/16/Psalms-16-11.html"&gt;Psalms 16:11&lt;/a&gt;, being in the presence of God carries an overwhelming sense of joy, fulfillment, and pleasure. Therefore, God dwelt joyfully alone in eternity as the Trinity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Understanding that God exists eternally as a loving relationship between three distinct Persons helps us grasp the depth of His love and fellowship. It highlights His self-sufficiency and fulfillment within Himself and encourages us to seek a similar relationship with Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; Reflect on the idea that God did not create us out of necessity but out of overflow from His own joy and love. How does this impact your understanding of His desire for relationship with you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2. The Preincarnate Christ&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/1/John-1-1.html"&gt;John 1:1&lt;/a&gt; tells us that Jesus also existed before creation: “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.” The preincarnate Christ was intimately united with the Father and partook of His glory. In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/17/John-17-5.html"&gt;John 17:5&lt;/a&gt;, Jesus Himself explains that He had glory with the Father before the world existed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Recognizing that Jesus, as the preincarnate Christ, existed alongside the Father before creation emphasizes His eternal nature and His role in the plan of redemption. It deepens our understanding of His sacrifice on the cross and strengthens our faith in Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; Consider the profound love and humility displayed by Jesus in willingly leaving His glory behind to become human and offer Himself as a sacrifice for our sins. How does this inspire you to live out your faith?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QPywCD-TSd0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;3. The Holy Spirit's Presence&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Holy Spirit was present before the creation of the universe. &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/1/Genesis-1-2.html"&gt;Genesis 1:2&lt;/a&gt; describes the Spirit as "hovering over the face" of the dark and formless earth. This presence indicates that the Holy Spirit played a role in the work of creation, bringing order out of chaos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Understanding that the Holy Spirit was present from the beginning emphasizes His active involvement in the work of God. It reminds us of His ongoing work in our lives today, empowering and guiding us as believers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; Consider how the presence of the Holy Spirit in your life brings order, peace, and guidance. How can you rely more on His power and leading?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;4. God's Complete Joy and Fulfillment&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before creating the universe, God experienced absolute satisfaction in Himself. As a loving Trinity, God found complete joy and fulfillment in beholding and communing with Himself. He possessed perfect knowledge of Himself and dwelt in eternal, complete joy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Recognizing God's self-sufficiency challenges our tendency to seek fulfillment in worldly pursuits or relationships. It encourages us to find our ultimate satisfaction in Him rather than relying on external circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; Reflect on times when you have sought fulfillment outside of your relationship with God. How can you shift your focus back to finding true joy and fulfillment in Him alone?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;5. Mystery Surrounding God's Activities&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the Bible provides some insight into what God was doing before creation, much remains a mystery. We know that at some point, the Trinity discussed the redemption of mankind. However, the specific details and timing of these discussions are not revealed to us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Embracing the mystery surrounding God's activities before creation humbles us, reminding us that our finite minds cannot fully comprehend the infinite God. It encourages us to trust in His wisdom and sovereignty even when we don't have all the answers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; Consider how your faith can grow when you trust in God's wisdom and embrace the mysteries of His ways. How can you cultivate a deeper sense of awe and wonder in your relationship with Him?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before the universe was created, God existed eternally as the Trinity. The Father, Son, and Holy Spirit experienced perfect joy and fulfillment within their loving relationship. Jesus, as the preincarnate Christ, shared in this glory and existed alongside the Father from eternity past. The Holy Spirit played an active role in creation. While much about God's activities before creation remains a mystery, embracing this mystery deepens our faith and encourages us to find our ultimate satisfaction in Him alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we contemplate what God was doing before creation, may we be filled with awe and wonder at His eternal nature and perfect love. May we seek to know Him more deeply and find our true joy and fulfillment in Him.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/The Nature of God/Time and Place"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Unveiling God's Time: Understanding Divine Timing for Christian Believers</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/god-time/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-04-08T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-04-08T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-04-08:/god-time/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;God and Time&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We live in a physical world with four known dimensions: length, width, height, and time. However, God exists in a different realm—the spirit realm—beyond our physical perception. While God is real, He is not limited by the physical laws and dimensions that govern our world (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/57/Isaiah-57-15.html"&gt;Isaiah 57:15&lt;/a&gt;). So, what is God's relationship to time?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;God's Timelessness&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/90/Psalm-90-4.html"&gt;Psalm 90:4&lt;/a&gt;, Moses used an analogy to describe the timelessness of God: "For a thousand years in Your sight are like a day that has just gone by, or like a watch in the night." This contrast between the eternity of God and the temporality of man highlights that our lives are short and frail, while God remains unchanging and timeless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From God's perspective, time is irrelevant because He transcends it. In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/2-Peter/3/2-Peter-3-8.html"&gt;2 Peter 3:8&lt;/a&gt;, Peter reminds his readers that God's perspective on time is vastly different from ours. The passing of time on Earth is inconsequential to God's timeless perspective. A second is no different from an eon; a billion years pass like seconds to the eternal God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to note that we, as finite beings, cannot fully comprehend the concept of eternity or the timelessness of God. We can only grasp it in part and describe Him as a God without a beginning or end—eternal, infinite, and everlasting (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/90/Psalm-90-2.html"&gt;Psalm 90:2&lt;/a&gt;). To put it simply, time is a measure of duration and change. Our clocks mark change, indicating the passage of time. However, for God, who does not change, time has no meaning or relation to Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Beginning of Time&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The science of physics tells us that time is a property resulting from the existence of matter. Time exists when matter exists. However, God is not matter; He created matter. Therefore, time began when God created the universe. Before that, God simply existed without the existence of matter, and time had no meaning or relation to Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eternity is a term used to express the concept of something that has no end or beginning. While God has no beginning or end, He cannot be wholly defined by eternity as a measure of time. Eternity is one of God’s attributes, but He is greater than time and exists outside of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vf1jy0nCHnA" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scripture reveals that God lives outside the bounds of time as we know it. Our destiny was planned "before the beginning of time" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/2-Timothy/1/2-Timothy-1-9.html"&gt;2 Timothy 1:9&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Titus/1/Titus-1-2.html"&gt;Titus 1:2&lt;/a&gt;) and "before the creation of the world" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Ephesians/1/Ephesians-1-4.html"&gt;Ephesians 1:4&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-Peter/1/1-Peter-1-20.html"&gt;1 Peter 1:20&lt;/a&gt;). The physical universe we experience was created by God from a source independent of the physical dimensions we can perceive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Timeless God&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While God is timeless, it is important to note that He is in time with us right now. He is not unreachably transcendent but present in this very moment. This understanding brings comfort to believers, knowing that God can respond to our needs and prayers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding God's relationship to time helps us grasp His eternal nature and transcendent power. It reminds us that God is not confined by the limitations and constraints of our physical world but exists beyond them. This knowledge deepens our awe and reverence for Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Think About It&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take a moment to reflect on the concept of eternity and the timelessness of God. How does this understanding impact your perception of His power and presence in your life? Consider how knowing that God transcends time can bring comfort and hope in times of difficulty or uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/The Nature of God/Time and Place"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Unlimited and Unmeasurable: Exploring the Infinite Nature of God</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/god-unlimited-unmeasurable/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-03-31T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-03-31T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-03-31:/god-unlimited-unmeasurable/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;God: Unlimited and Unmeasurable&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the Christian faith, God is often described as unlimited and unmeasurable. This means that God is free from all limitations and cannot be confined or restricted by anything in the universe. All of God's attributes, such as holiness, love, and wisdom, are infinite and perfect. It's important to note that when we say something is "unmeasurable," it doesn't necessarily mean it is infinite or unlimited in the same way that God is. The concept of being unmeasurable or unlimited is subject to the limitations of the measurer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a logical perspective, there has to be a single "First Cause" that is necessary for everything else to exist. Rather than making God impossible, logic actually makes Him necessary. God is not just a part of reality; He is reality itself. While there are things in existence that are not God, He is still the ultimate source and foundation of their existence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's also worth mentioning that infinity, when it comes to God, is not a property that can be present in some attributes but not others. One must either be entirely infinite or not infinite at all. For example, to be omnipotent (having all power), one must also be omniscient (having all knowledge) and omnipresent (being present everywhere). All of God's attributes come from the same source - He is the one and only ultimate and necessary being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We break down God's attributes into different categories like omnipotence, omniscience, eternality, etc., to make it easier for our finite minds to comprehend Him. However, in reality, all of these attributes stem from the fact that God is the source of everything else. He simply is - as expressed in His own words when He called Himself "I AM."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qSdRDurOhHE" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's important to note that while God is infinite and unlimited, other beings cannot be truly infinite in the same sense as God. Everything that exists apart from God is a result of His creative work, and every created thing must be fundamentally different from God. Therefore, it is impossible for beings to be truly infinite like God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God is not just an impersonal force or energy; He is a personal being who describes Himself as such in the Bible. This is why our reality operates the way it does. We can't expect to see communication, unity, and relationship in the created world if those properties were not present in the First Cause. In God's nature, we see the Trinity, which embodies communication, unity, and relationship. Without these properties in the First Cause, we would never witness them in the creation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the unlimited and unmeasurable nature of God has significant implications for our faith. It reminds us that God is above and beyond anything we can comprehend or measure. It humbles us and encourages us to approach Him with reverence and awe. Recognizing God's infinitude also helps us grasp His power, wisdom, and love more fully, knowing that they are limitless and perfect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This understanding also helps us differentiate between God and everything else in creation. While there are aspects of creation that reflect God's attributes to some extent, they are not on the same level as God Himself. This prevents us from idolizing or worshiping created things and directs our focus solely on the Creator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does the concept of God being unlimited and unmeasurable impact your understanding of His attributes?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In what ways does recognizing God's infinitude affect your perspective on the created world?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does understanding that God is a personal being impact your relationship with Him?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consider how recognizing God's infinitude might shape your approach to worshiping Him.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reflect on how the concept of an infinite and unlimited God offers comfort and assurance in times of difficulty or uncertainty.&lt;/li&gt;

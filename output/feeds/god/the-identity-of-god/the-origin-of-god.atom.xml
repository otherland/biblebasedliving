&lt;p&gt;The concept of the first cause arises from the law of cause and effect, which states that every effect has a cause. If there were an infinite chain of causality extending into the past, there would never have been a present. Therefore, there must be something that itself has no cause and that caused everything else. While people may debate over the identity of this first cause, it is logically undeniable that it exists. In fact, it almost makes more sense to ask if the first cause is God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we combine reason with observation, we can glean insights about the nature of this first cause. Ultimately, these characteristics align with the God depicted in the Bible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Eternal and Uncaused&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first cause must be eternal, without a beginning, and not caused by anything else. According to &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/1/John-1-3.html"&gt;John 1:3&lt;/a&gt;, God is not made but exists independently. He is eternal and has always existed (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/90/Psalm-90-2.html"&gt;Psalm 90:2&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Understanding that God is eternal helps us grasp His unchanging nature and timeless existence. It also reinforces our belief in His sovereignty and power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; Consider how your understanding of God might change if you believed He had a beginning or was caused by something else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Necessary and Noncontingent&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first cause is necessary, meaning it must exist and cannot not exist. Everything else, in contrast, is contingent, depending on something else for its existence. God fits this description perfectly as He is self-existent and does not rely on anything for His existence (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Exodus/3/Exodus-3-14.html"&gt;Exodus 3:14&lt;/a&gt;). He is the creator and caused all other things (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/1/Genesis-1-1.html"&gt;Genesis 1:1&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/1/Hebrews-1-3.html"&gt;Hebrews 1:3&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Recognizing God as necessary reaffirms His supreme authority and sets Him apart from all other created beings. It highlights His role as the sustainer of everything in existence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; How does understanding God as necessary affect your view of His involvement in the world and your own life?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Changeless and Perfect&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first cause must be changeless, unaffected by external forces or events. It is also perfect, serving as the standard for all other things. In the Bible, God is described as unchanging (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Malachi/3/Malachi-3-6.html"&gt;Malachi 3:6&lt;/a&gt;) and perfect (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/6/Isaiah-6-3.html"&gt;Isaiah 6:3&lt;/a&gt;). He is the source of all that is (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/2/Genesis-2-3.html"&gt;Genesis 2:3&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Recognizing God's changelessness reassures us of His faithfulness and consistency. Understanding His perfection helps us grasp the depth of His wisdom and righteousness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; How might your perception of God's character and attributes change if you believed He could be influenced or improved upon?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Creative and Intelligent&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mbGxtfboRhQ" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Observing the diversity and complexity in the natural world suggests that the first cause must be creative and phenomenally intelligent. The Bible affirms this, stating that God is the creator of all things (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/147/Psalm-147-4.html"&gt;Psalm 147:4&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/19/Psalm-19-1.html"&gt;Psalm 19:1&lt;/a&gt;) and His understanding is beyond measure (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/55/Isaiah-55-8.html"&gt;Isaiah 55:8&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Recognizing God's creativity and intelligence helps us appreciate the intricate beauty and purpose in the world around us. It also highlights His ability to bring order out of chaos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; How does recognizing God's creativity and intelligence impact your understanding of human creativity and intelligence?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Powerful and Personal&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To create and sustain everything, the first cause must possess incredible power. Additionally, the existence of intelligent life in a universe finely tuned for life suggests that the first cause is personal. The Bible describes God as supremely powerful (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Job/38/Job-38-1.html"&gt;Job 38:1&lt;/a&gt;–7) and personal, governing both physical properties and moral standards (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Deuteronomy/32/Deuteronomy-32-4.html"&gt;Deuteronomy 32:4&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Recognizing God's power assures us of His ability to overcome any challenge or obstacle. Understanding His personhood allows for a personal relationship with Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; How does recognizing God's power and personhood impact your prayer life and your understanding of morality?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Trinity as the Best Explanation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The uniqueness and unity found in the universe suggest that the first cause must be both diverse and unified. This concept aligns with the Christian belief in the Trinity. Just as the universe exhibits both diversity and unity, so does the Trinity, which consists of three distinct persons yet remains one God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Understanding the Trinity helps us comprehend God's nature and His relationship with humanity. It also emphasizes the importance of unity and diversity within the Christian community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; How does understanding the Trinity affect your understanding of God's love, community, and individuality?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, when we explore the idea of the first cause through reason and observation, we find that it aligns with the God described in the Bible. While different approaches may use varying terminology, they ultimately point to God as the first cause. Recognizing God as eternal, necessary, changeless, perfect, creative, intelligent, powerful, personal, and triune deepens our understanding of His character and His role as the source of all existence.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/The Identity of God/The Origin of God"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Unveiling the Eternal Mystery: Who Created God Revealed</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/who-created-god/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-05-28T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-05-28T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-05-28:/who-created-god/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Who Created God?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many skeptics and atheists often argue that if all things need a cause, then God must also need a cause.

This …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Who Created God?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many skeptics and atheists often argue that if all things need a cause, then God must also need a cause. This line of thinking leads to the conclusion that if God needed a cause, then He is not truly God, and therefore, there is no God. This argument is based on the assumption that God came from somewhere and asks where that might be. However, this question is flawed because it assumes that God is subject to the same rules of causality as everything else. In reality, God is not in the category of things that are created or caused. He simply exists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Flawed Assumption&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To better understand this concept, let's consider an analogy. Asking "What does blue smell like?" doesn't make sense because blue is not something that has a smell. Similarly, asking who created God assumes that God fits into the category of created beings, but He does not. God is uncaused and uncreated—He has always existed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Argument from Existence&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can further support this understanding by considering the principle that from nothing, nothing comes. If there were ever a time when absolutely nothing existed, then nothing would have ever come into existence. However, we know that things do exist. Therefore, there must have always been something in existence. This eternal entity is what we call God—the uncaused Being who caused everything else to come into existence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dt1biSFGBLY" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The Nature of God&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God exists outside the boundaries of time and space, and He transcends our human comprehension. Trying to fully grasp the nature of God is beyond our limited understanding, but we can appreciate His existence and attributes through what He has revealed to us in the Bible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Bible, we learn that God is eternal (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/90/Psalm-90-2.html"&gt;Psalm 90:2&lt;/a&gt;), meaning He has no beginning or end. He is self-existent and does not rely on anything or anyone for His existence. God is also omnipotent (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Jeremiah/32/Jeremiah-32-17.html"&gt;Jeremiah 32:17&lt;/a&gt;), meaning He has unlimited power. He is omniscient (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/147/Psalm-147-5.html"&gt;Psalm 147:5&lt;/a&gt;), having complete knowledge and understanding of all things. Additionally, God is omnipresent (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/139/Psalm-139-7.html"&gt;Psalm 139:7-10&lt;/a&gt;), meaning He is present everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding that God is uncaused and uncreated helps us grasp the greatness and majesty of our Creator. It reminds us that God is not subject to the limitations of the physical world and that He is the ultimate source of everything that exists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Realizing that God has always existed also has implications for our understanding of time. It challenges our finite perspective and invites us to trust in His eternal plan and purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reflect on the concept of eternity. How does the idea of an eternal God impact your understanding of time and existence?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consider the limitations of human understanding when it comes to comprehending the nature of God. How does this challenge you to approach your faith with humility and awe?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember, while we may not fully comprehend the nature of God, we can trust in His existence and rely on His love, wisdom, and sovereignty in our lives.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/The Identity of God/The Origin of God"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Divine Unmoved Mover: Understanding Aristotle’s Influence on Christian Theology</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/unmoved-mover-aristotle/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-05-17T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-05-17T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-05-17:/unmoved-mover-aristotle/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;The Concept of the Unmoved Mover&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The concept of an "unmoved mover" has been discussed by philosophers for centuries, with Aristotle being one of the most well-known proponents of this idea. While Aristotle may not have been the first to frame the concept in this way, his argument in favor of it has had a significant impact on philosophical and theological thought. The notion of an unmoved mover was later used in Christian theology by thinkers like Thomas Aquinas, who identified God as the Unmoved Mover. However, it is essential to note that there are crucial differences between Aristotle's understanding of the unmoved mover and how later theologians like Aquinas used it to refer to the God of the Bible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Aristotle's Unmoved Mover&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aristotle, a student of Plato, developed the idea of an unmoved mover based on earlier concepts. Plato taught that ultimate reality consisted of ideal Forms and that a primary entity called the Demiurge had created the world. Aristotle took a more abstract approach and viewed the unmoved mover as something separate from personal beings. In his writings, Aristotle follows a logical and observational chain of reasoning that leads him to conclude that there must be something to cause motion, a "mover." However, Aristotle applied this idea individually to the various spheres of the heavens, which he believed numbered either 47 or 55. To Aristotle, these were not personal or relatable beings but purely intellectual entities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pyKLEvIMlqg" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Aristotle's writings progress, there seems to be a shift in his thinking or a growing conclusion that alters his initial premise. He realizes that if there are multiple unmoved movers, there can be no ultimate explanation in the universe. Therefore, Aristotle deduces that behind these "movers" of the celestial spheres, there must exist a single, solitary, and ultimate cause. According to Aristotle's reasoning, causality cannot end with multiple unmoved movers; it must terminate with a single unmoved mover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is crucial to understand that Aristotle's concept of the unmoved mover is purely abstract and not a personal being. He does not view this ultimate cause as a person or even a deity but rather as "thought, thinking about itself." While this concept aligns with the Bible's depiction of God in a technical sense, it is important to note that Aristotle himself would not have identified a personal being such as God with his theory. Aristotle's unmoved mover is not the God of the Bible, but rather an incomplete piece of the puzzle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Compatibility with the Bible&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aristotle's musings on astronomy and his conclusion that an uncaused, non-physical "unmoved mover" exists aligns with a principle found in the Bible. &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/19/Psalm-19-1.html"&gt;Psalm 19:1&lt;/a&gt; declares that "the heavens" display the work of God, and &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/1/Romans-1-19.html"&gt;Romans 1:19&lt;/a&gt;–20 states that evidence of God can be seen in nature. From these natural observations, Aristotle correctly deduced the existence of an unmoved mover responsible for the universe's existence. However, what he did not fully realize was that this conclusion points to an eternal, personal Creator, which is the God of the Bible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding Aristotle's concept of the unmoved mover and its relationship to Christian theology has several implications. Firstly, it highlights the compatibility between philosophical reasoning and biblical truths. It shows that philosophical arguments can lead to conclusions that align with Christian beliefs, providing further evidence for the existence of God. Secondly, it emphasizes the importance of discernment in theological discussions. While Aristotle's unmoved mover aligns with some aspects of Christian belief, it falls short in fully capturing the nature and character of God as revealed in the Bible. This distinction reminds Christians to approach philosophical concepts with caution and rely primarily on Scripture for understanding God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Think About It&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider how Aristotle's concept of an unmoved mover differs from the biblical understanding of God. Reflect on the limitations of philosophical reasoning in capturing the fullness of God's nature and character. How does this challenge you to seek a deeper understanding of God through Scripture?&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/The Identity of God/The Origin of God"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>The Ultimate Guide to Understanding the Aseity of God</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/aseity-of-god/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-04-26T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-04-26T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-04-26:/aseity-of-god/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;The Aseity of God: Understanding His Independent Self-Existence&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The aseity of God is an essential attribute that defines His independent self-existence. It means that God is the uncaused Cause and the uncreated Creator. He is the ultimate source of all things, the One who originated everything and sustains everything that exists. There is no other like Him, as He declares in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/46/Isaiah-46-9.html"&gt;Isaiah 46:9&lt;/a&gt;, "For I am God, and there is no other; I am God, and there is none like Me."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What Does Aseity Mean?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The term "aseity" comes from the Latin words "a" (without) and "se" (self). It refers to God's complete independence and self-sufficiency. God has no need because He is complete in and of Himself. He did not create humanity out of loneliness or necessity; rather, He has always been self-sufficient. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God's declaration of His name in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Exodus/3/Exodus-3-14.html"&gt;Exodus 3:14&lt;/a&gt; embodies the concept of His aseity. When Moses asked about His name, God replied, "I AM WHO I AM." This name signifies that God is the eternally self-existent Being who always was and always will be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Eternal and Unchanging Nature of God&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God’s aseity is closely related to His eternal and unchangeable nature. He is eternal, meaning He did not have a beginning and will never have an end. As &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/90/Psalm-90-2.html"&gt;Psalm 90:2&lt;/a&gt; states, "Before the mountains were born or you brought forth the whole world, from everlasting to everlasting you are God." &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God's unchangeability is another aspect of His aseity. He remains the same yesterday, today, and forever (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Malachi/3/Malachi-3-6.html"&gt;Malachi 3:6&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/James/1/James-1-17.html"&gt;James 1:17&lt;/a&gt;). All of God’s attributes—such as His love, power, wisdom—are eternal and unchanging. They have always been as they are and will never be any different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pkGxau6He_U" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The Autonomy and Sovereignty of God&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God's aseity assures us that His autonomy is absolute. He alone decides what to do, and nothing can ever thwart His purpose or hinder Him from keeping His promises. &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/46/Isaiah-46-10.html"&gt;Isaiah 46:10&lt;/a&gt; emphasizes this aspect of God's nature, "My purpose will stand, and I will do all that I please." &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When God promises to do something, He will fulfill it. His predictions will come to pass. We can trust in His aseity and sovereignty because nothing is beyond His control. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Jesus Christ Shares the Aseity of God&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus Christ, being God in flesh, shares the aseity of God with the Father. He claimed the name "I AM" for Himself, as seen in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/8/John-8-58.html"&gt;John 8:58&lt;/a&gt; and 18:6. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Colossians/1/Colossians-1-16.html"&gt;Colossians 1:16&lt;/a&gt;–17, Paul declares that Jesus is the Creator of all things: "In him all things were created: things in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or powers or rulers or authorities; all things have been created through him and for him. He is before all things, and in him all things hold together." &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus is not a created being but rather the eternal God who took on human form. After His resurrection, He ascended back into heaven to take His rightful place as the Creator of the universe. The declaration made by God in Isaiah 44:6b, "I am the First and the Last," is also claimed by Jesus in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Revelation/1/Revelation-1-17.html"&gt;Revelation 1:17&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Assurance and Dependence on God's Aseity&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of the aseity of God, we can depend on Him as the independent One who is able to deliver, protect, and keep those who trust in Him. Those whom God has purposed for salvation will come to Christ, and nothing can hinder them. As Jesus said in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/6/John-6-37.html"&gt;John 6:37&lt;/a&gt;, "All those the Father gives me will come to me, and whoever comes to me I will never drive away." &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the biblical doctrine of the aseity of God safeguards us from thinking that God is finite, that He grows weary, or that He will ever be insufficient to meet our needs. We can rest assured that God's independence and self-sufficiency make Him more than capable of fulfilling His promises and providing for His people (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/23/Psalm-23-1.html"&gt;Psalm 23:1&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the aseity of God is crucial because it reveals His divine nature as the independent, eternal, and unchangeable Creator. Recognizing God's aseity helps us grasp His sovereignty and autonomy in all things. It reminds us of His faithfulness in keeping His promises and assures us of His ability to meet our needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Think About It&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take a moment to reflect on the significance of God's aseity. Consider how this attribute impacts your understanding of His character and your relationship with Him. How does knowing that God is independent and self-sufficient affect your trust and reliance on Him? Spend time meditating on the unchanging nature of God and find comfort in His eternal love and wisdom.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/The Identity of God/The Origin of God"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry></feed>

&lt;p&gt;As Christians, we often wonder if God truly loves us as individuals. It can be challenging to grasp the concept of God's love when we are surrounded by conditional love from finite human beings. We recognize our flaws and shortcomings, and we understand that God is perfect and sinless, making it difficult to comprehend why He would love us. However, the truth of the gospel is that God does love us! Scripture repeatedly reminds us of His love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;God's Intimate Creation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God created humankind in His own image with great care and concern. In Genesis, we see that God formed man from the dust of the ground and breathed life into him. He then created woman from one of man's ribs. This act of creation displays an intimacy between God and humanity that is unique. Unlike the rest of creation, which God spoke into existence, He took time and effort to form and shape us. He entrusted us with dominion over the earth (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/1/Genesis-1-28.html"&gt;Genesis 1:28&lt;/a&gt;) and had direct communication with Adam and Eve. Even after the Fall, when they hid from God in shame, it was not abnormal for them to speak with Him; it was abnormal for them to hide. Despite the broken relationship caused by sin, God's love remained evident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;God's Protective Love&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Adam and Eve sinned, God demonstrated His love through His actions. He made garments of skin to clothe them and protect them from further harm (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/3/Genesis-3-21.html"&gt;Genesis 3:21-23&lt;/a&gt;). This act was not vindictive or punitive; it was an expression of love. God banished them from the Garden of Eden to ensure they would not eat from the tree of life in their fallen state. Even in their disobedience, God acted out of love for their well-being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A Plan of Redemption&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the moment sin entered the world, God had a plan in place for redemption and restoration. Scripture tells us that Jesus was the Lamb slain before the foundation of the world (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-Peter/1/1-Peter-1-20.html"&gt;1 Peter 1:20&lt;/a&gt;). God's love for humankind was so great that He chose to create us, fully aware of the heartache it would cause Him to redeem us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Demonstrations of God's Love&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout the Bible, we find numerous examples of God's love for us. The psalmists, especially David, eloquently express God's love. Psalm 139 is a beautiful reflection on God's intimate knowledge and love for each individual. The Song of Solomon provides a poignant picture of love. Even in the history of the Israelites, we see God's love as He preserves a remnant and pleads with His people to obey and live. God is just, but He is also merciful, tender, and jealous for His people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QPywCD-TSd0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Jesus: The Ultimate Expression of Love&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pinnacle of God's love for humanity is seen in Jesus Christ. God took on human flesh and entered our world to redeem us (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Philippians/2/Philippians-2-5.html"&gt;Philippians 2:5&lt;/a&gt;–11). He was born into an unassuming family in humble circumstances, spending His first night in a manger among animals. Jesus associated with society's outcasts, showed compassion for the sick, healed the broken-hearted, blessed children, and taught us about God's love. In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/13/Luke-13-34.html"&gt;Luke 13:34&lt;/a&gt;, Jesus cried out in anguish over Jerusalem, longing to gather its people under His protective wings. This demonstrates God's desire for a restored relationship with us — not to punish us but to love us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Cross: A Clear Declaration of Love&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ultimate expression of God's love is seen in Jesus' passion and crucifixion. Paul reminds us that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/5/Romans-5-6.html"&gt;Romans 5:6-8&lt;/a&gt;). Jesus' death on the cross was a clear declaration of God's unconditional love. We were in our worst state when Christ died for us, yet He willingly gave Himself up to save us. It is by God's grace, not our own merit, that we are saved (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Ephesians/2/Ephesians-2-1.html"&gt;Ephesians 2:1&lt;/a&gt;, 4-5).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abundant Life Through God's Love&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through Jesus' sacrifice, God made abundant life possible for us. Jesus declared that He came so that we may have life to the full (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/10/John-10-10.html"&gt;John 10:10&lt;/a&gt;). God's love for us is not stingy; He wants to lavish His love upon us. There is no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/8/Romans-8-1.html"&gt;Romans 8:1-2&lt;/a&gt;). Paul, who was once an enemy of Christ, found God's grace and accepted His love. He proclaimed that nothing can separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/8/Romans-8-31.html"&gt;Romans 8:31-32&lt;/a&gt;, 35, 37-39).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding and experiencing God's love is crucial for our faith and relationship with Him. Knowing that God loves us unconditionally transforms our perspective on ourselves, others, and the world around us. It gives us hope, assurance, and a deep sense of belonging. Embracing God's love allows us to live with confidence and joy, knowing that we are secure in His care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Think About It&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take a moment to reflect on God's love for you. Consider the depth of His love as demonstrated through creation, protection, redemption, and the sacrifice of Jesus on the cross. How does knowing that God loves you personally impact your life? How can you respond to His love and show it to others? Spend time in prayer, thanking God for His love and asking Him to help you experience and share it more fully in your daily life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember: Yes! God loves you. As hard as it may be to believe at times, it is the truth. His love for you is unconditional, unfailing, and everlasting.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/God's Relationship to Us/He Cares For Us"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Does God Hate Me? Understanding God's Unconditional Love for You</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/does-god-hate-me/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-09-25T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-09-25T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-09-25:/does-god-hate-me/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Does God Hate Me?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question of whether God hates us is a common one that many people struggle with. It is important to understand that the answer to this question is a resounding "no." As human beings, we have been created in the image of God (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/1/Genesis-1-27.html"&gt;Genesis 1:27 …&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Does God Hate Me?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question of whether God hates us is a common one that many people struggle with. It is important to understand that the answer to this question is a resounding "no." As human beings, we have been created in the image of God (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/1/Genesis-1-27.html"&gt;Genesis 1:27&lt;/a&gt;), and He loves what He has created. However, there are several reasons why some individuals may believe that God hates them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Sin&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the primary reasons people may feel that God hates them is because of their sin. God is perfect, while we as humans are flawed and sinful (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/3/Romans-3-23.html"&gt;Romans 3:23&lt;/a&gt;). Sin creates a barrier between us and God, hindering us from fully reflecting His goodness and likeness. Since the fall of humanity in the Garden of Eden, we have been inclined to rebel against our Creator and assert our own desires (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/3/Genesis-3-1.html"&gt;Genesis 3:1-6&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite our sinful nature, God does not hate us. In fact, He desires for us to be with Him forever. To bridge the gap caused by sin, God entered our world as Jesus Christ, demonstrating His immense love for us (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/3/John-3-16.html"&gt;John 3:16-18&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Philippians/2/Philippians-2-5.html"&gt;Philippians 2:5-11&lt;/a&gt;). Jesus shed His blood to cover our sins, offering salvation to all who believe in Him (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/3/John-3-16.html"&gt;John 3:16&lt;/a&gt;, 36). When we accept Jesus as our Lord and Savior, acknowledging His right to rule over us, God adopts us as His beloved children (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/8/Romans-8-15.html"&gt;Romans 8:15&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Ephesians/1/Ephesians-1-5.html"&gt;Ephesians 1:5&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-John/3/1-John-3-1.html"&gt;1 John 3:1&lt;/a&gt;). As His children, we have the freedom to approach Him at any time, find forgiveness when we make mistakes, and anticipate an eternal life in heaven with Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Flawed Understanding of God&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another reason people may believe that God hates them is due to a skewed understanding of who He truly is. The world is filled with various religious beliefs and teachings, many of which present distorted views of God. Even within Christianity, different denominations may emphasize certain traits of God while excluding others, leading to misconceptions about His nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bible provides us with a clear picture of the character of God. &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/James/4/James-4-7.html"&gt;James 4:7-10&lt;/a&gt; outlines the steps to being accepted into God's presence: submitting to Him, resisting the devil, drawing near to God, purifying our lives, allowing Jesus to cleanse our hearts, and humbling ourselves before God. These actions demonstrate God's longing for us to know Him. By submitting to His authority, obeying His Word, and resisting the temptations of Satan, we can draw near to God and experience His love and acceptance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Pride&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Eq6LECrhCv8" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lack of humility is another factor that can lead people to believe that God hates them. Sometimes when people ask if God hates them, what they truly mean is whether He will accept them while allowing them to continue in their pet sins without change. Scripture is clear that this mindset is incompatible with true repentance and salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we define ourselves by a particular sin and refuse to let go of it, we hinder ourselves from fully accepting the new nature that Jesus provides (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/2-Corinthians/5/2-Corinthians-5-17.html"&gt;2 Corinthians 5:17&lt;/a&gt;). Pride insists on doing things our own way and when God does not conform to our desires, we may conclude that He hates us. However, God's love for us compels Him to insist that we do things His way. Pride was the first sin and corrupted humanity (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/14/Isaiah-14-12.html"&gt;Isaiah 14:12-14&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/3/Genesis-3-5.html"&gt;Genesis 3:5-6&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-John/2/1-John-2-15.html"&gt;1 John 2:15-16&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God does not hate anyone in the sense of unfairly withholding blessings. However, those who persistently choose rebellion against God's plan for their lives will experience the consequences of their choices (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-Samuel/2/1-Samuel-2-30.html"&gt;1 Samuel 2:30&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Malachi/2/Malachi-2-2.html"&gt;Malachi 2:2&lt;/a&gt;). Rejecting God's offer of salvation through Jesus Christ ultimately leads to facing the righteous consequences of our sins (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/7/Matthew-7-13.html"&gt;Matthew 7:13-14&lt;/a&gt;; 25:41; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/3/John-3-36.html"&gt;John 3:36&lt;/a&gt;). This rejection results in an eternity where individuals acknowledge the rightness of their punishment for rejecting the sacrifice made by God's Son on their behalf (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/16/Luke-16-19.html"&gt;Luke 16:19-31&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/10/Hebrews-10-29.html"&gt;Hebrews 10:29&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding that God does not hate us is crucial because it allows us to experience His love and accept His offer of salvation. Recognizing the barriers that sin and pride create in our relationship with God helps us take necessary steps to draw near to Him. Embracing a correct understanding of who God is enables us to know Him more intimately and appreciate His unconditional love for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reflect on your own understanding of God. Are there any misconceptions or false teachings that you have believed? How can you align your beliefs with the truth revealed in the Bible?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consider any areas of pride in your life that may hinder your relationship with God. Are there sins or attitudes that you need to let go of in order to fully submit to His authority?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take time to meditate on the immense love that God has demonstrated through the sacrifice of Jesus Christ. How does this truth impact your perception of His character?&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the Bible, there are numerous verses that speak about God's provision for His people. One such verse is &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Philippians/4/Philippians-4-19.html"&gt;Philippians 4:19&lt;/a&gt;, which assures us that God will supply all our needs according to His riches in glory in Christ Jesus. However, it …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;God's Provision: A Source of Abundant Blessings&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Bible, there are numerous verses that speak about God's provision for His people. One such verse is &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Philippians/4/Philippians-4-19.html"&gt;Philippians 4:19&lt;/a&gt;, which assures us that God will supply all our needs according to His riches in glory in Christ Jesus. However, it is crucial to understand that God's provision extends beyond material possessions and encompasses every aspect of our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1. God's Desire for Our Well-being&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as a loving parent desires the best for their child, God wants to provide for us in a way that promotes our growth and development into Christlikeness. He knows what is best for us and would never give us something that would harm us. Therefore, it is essential to recognize that God's provision goes beyond material possessions and encompasses spiritual growth and transformation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding God's intention behind His provision helps us shift our focus from acquiring earthly possessions to seeking a deeper relationship with Him. It encourages us to align our desires with His and prioritize eternal matters over temporary gains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Think About It&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider how you can cultivate a heart that seeks God's provision not only for material needs but also for spiritual growth and transformation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2. Differentiating between Needs and Wants&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God differentiates between our needs and wants because He understands that where our treasure is, our heart will also be. He wants us to recognize that this world is not our ultimate home, and part of what we truly need is to shift our focus towards eternal life while still living in the present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the difference between needs and wants helps us align our priorities with God's perspective. It allows us to seek His kingdom first and trust Him to provide for our genuine needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Think About It&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take some time to reflect on your own desires and priorities. Are you seeking after material possessions or focusing on the eternal life that God offers?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;3. God's Comprehensive Care for Us&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God's provision extends to every part of our being - spirit, soul, and body. He is infinitely good and desires to provide for us in ways that surpass our understanding. His care goes beyond what we could ever achieve on our own, and we can trust in His guidance and shepherding to lead us towards a fulfilling life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recognizing God's comprehensive care for us brings comfort and assurance in times of need or uncertainty. It reminds us that we are never alone, and God is always working for our good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Think About It&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider the ways in which you have experienced God's comprehensive care in your life. Reflect on how it has brought you comfort and reassurance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;4. Trusting God for Daily Provision&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Lord's Prayer, Jesus teaches His disciples to ask for daily provision, acknowledging our dependence on God. He assures us that the Father knows our needs and encourages us to seek first His kingdom and righteousness. By entrusting our daily requirements to God, we acknowledge His covenant relationship with us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trusting God for our daily provision deepens our reliance on Him and strengthens our faith. It reminds us that He is not only concerned about our physical needs but also desires a close relationship with us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Think About It&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/d8BwydIR-r0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reflect on your own prayer life. Do you trust God to provide for your daily needs? How can you deepen your reliance on Him in this area?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;5. Walking Uprightly: A Key to Receiving Provision&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/84/Psalm-84-11.html"&gt;Psalm 84:11&lt;/a&gt; states that God does not withhold any good thing from those who walk uprightly. This verse emphasizes the importance of living a righteous life as we seek God's provision. Our actions and motives play a significant role in experiencing the fullness of His blessings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the connection between our obedience and God's provision helps us align our lives with His will. It reminds us of the importance of living in righteousness and seeking to honor Him in all we do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Think About It&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reflect on your own life. Are there areas where you need to align your actions and motives with God's will? How can you cultivate a lifestyle of obedience to experience His provision more fully?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;6. The Importance of Prayerful Motivations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/James/4/James-4-3.html"&gt;James 4:3&lt;/a&gt; reminds us that sometimes our prayers go unanswered because we ask with wrong motives. God sees the intentions of our hearts, and our prayers' motivations are crucial to Him. It is important to align our desires with His will and seek His purposes above our own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the significance of prayerful motivations helps us approach God with a sincere heart. It encourages us to examine our own desires and align them with what honors and glorifies Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Think About It&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take some time to reflect on your own prayer life. Are your motivations aligned with God's will? How can you ensure that your prayers are rooted in a sincere desire to honor Him?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;7. God's Provision for Every Area of Life&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God's provision goes beyond our physical needs and encompasses the needs of our soul and spirit. He offers peace, comfort, power, love, self-discipline, and every spiritual blessing in Christ Jesus. In whatever circumstances we find ourselves, we can find contentment in the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the depth of God's provision allows us to find true contentment in Him, regardless of our external circumstances. It reminds us that His blessings extend far beyond material possessions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Think About It&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reflect on the ways in which you have experienced God's provision in your spiritual life. How has He provided peace, comfort, or other spiritual blessings? Take a moment to thank Him for His faithfulness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;8. God's Provision for All Creation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God's provision extends to His ongoing relationship with all of His creation. He watches over the rain, sun, winds, and tides, ensuring the well-being of all living beings. His love and care are evident in the intricate balance of nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recognizing God's provision for all creation reminds us of His sovereignty and goodness. It encourages us to appreciate and care for the world He has entrusted to us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Think About It&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take a moment to reflect on the beauty of nature and the ways in which God provides for all living beings. How can you be a good steward of the environment and reflect His care for creation?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, God's provision is not limited to material possessions but encompasses every aspect of our lives. Understanding His desire for our well-being, differentiating between needs and wants, trusting Him for daily provision, walking uprightly, aligning our prayers with His will, experiencing His provision in every area of life, and recognizing His care for all creation are all essential aspects of comprehending and appreciating God's abundant blessings. May we continually seek to deepen our understanding and experience of God's provision in our lives.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/God's Relationship to Us/He Cares For Us"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Does God Forget?

&lt;p&gt;When it comes to the topic of whether God forgets, there are several passages in the Bible that indicate God's forgiveness of our sins. For instance, &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/43/Isaiah-43-25.html"&gt;Isaiah 43:25&lt;/a&gt; says, “I, even I, am he who blots out your transgressions, for my own sake, and remembers your sins no more.” Additionally, Hebrews 10 explains how Jesus' sacrifice on the cross for sin was a once-and-for-all sacrifice. Unlike the sacrificial system of the Old Testament, in which sacrifices were continually made for sin, Jesus paid for sin completely. &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/10/Hebrews-10-14.html"&gt;Hebrews 10:14&lt;/a&gt;–18 states, “For by one sacrifice he has made perfect forever those who are being made holy. The Holy Spirit also testifies to us about this. First he says: ‘This is the covenant I will make with them after that time, says the Lord. I will put my laws in their hearts, and I will write them on their minds.’ Then he adds: ‘Their sins and lawless acts I will remember no more.’ And where these have been forgiven, sacrifice for sin is no longer necessary.” These passages make it clear that God does not remember our sins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, it's important to note that God's "not remembering" is not the same as human forgetfulness. God is omniscient and knows everything; He does not forget anything. Instead, when the Bible talks about God not remembering our sins, it means that He chooses not to bring them up or hold them against us. In human relationships, we can choose to remember the offenses someone has committed against us or choose to forget. To forgive someone, we often need to put painful memories out of our minds. Forgiveness allows us to move forward without dwelling on past troubles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/l42NpoAdJQ8" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than treating us as our sins deserve, God removes our sins from us as far as the east is from the west—an immeasurable distance (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/103/Psalm-103-12.html"&gt;Psalm 103:12&lt;/a&gt;). Think of traveling around the globe. When do you stop going east and start going west? It is impossible to say. When we are saved, our sins are completely forgiven. This is what the writer of Hebrews is talking about—Jesus made a one-time sacrifice that completely removes our sin. In Christ, we are justified (declared righteous) before God. &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/8/Romans-8-1.html"&gt;Romans 8:1&lt;/a&gt; tells us there is no condemnation for those who are in Christ. &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/8/Romans-8-31.html"&gt;Romans 8:31&lt;/a&gt;–39 beautifully discusses our security in Christ. Sin has no say in our standing with God. We are fully accepted and declared righteous in Him. God does not remember our sins in the way He treats us; instead, He treats us as righteous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even as Christians, we still sin, but we know that God is faithful to forgive us when we confess our sins (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-John/1/1-John-1-9.html"&gt;1 John 1:9&lt;/a&gt;). God cleanses us, and then He moves on. He does not hold our sins over us. Instead, He frees us from the slavery of sin and sets us free to experience a new life in Him. Knowing the complete forgiveness of God in Christ, we can join King Hezekiah in praising our Redeemer: “You have put all my sins behind your back” (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/38/Isaiah-38-17.html"&gt;Isaiah 38:17&lt;/a&gt;). Like Paul, we can forget what is behind and press on toward the goal to win the prize for which God has called us heavenward in Christ Jesus (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Philippians/3/Philippians-3-13.html"&gt;Philippians 3:13&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding that God forgives and does not remember our sins has significant implications for our relationship with Him and how we view ourselves. It means that once we have confessed our sins and received forgiveness through faith in Jesus Christ, there is no longer any condemnation for us (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/8/Romans-8-1.html"&gt;Romans 8:1&lt;/a&gt;). We can have confidence that we are completely forgiven and accepted by God. This knowledge should bring us great comfort and peace, knowing that our past sins do not define us or separate us from God's love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, understanding God's forgiveness should also shape how we relate to others. Just as God chooses not to remember our sins, we are called to forgive others and let go of their offenses against us. Forgiveness allows us to experience healing, restoration, and reconciliation in our relationships. It frees us from the burden of holding onto resentment and bitterness. The example set by God's forgiveness should inspire us to extend the same grace and mercy to others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does understanding God's forgiveness impact your view of yourself and your relationship with Him?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In what ways can you apply the concept of forgiveness in your relationships with others?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reflect on the freedom and peace that comes from knowing that God does not hold your past sins against you.&lt;/li&gt;

Jesus said that no …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Does God Pursue Us&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pursuit of God is a central theme throughout the Bible. While human beings are commanded to pursue God and promised that they will find Him when they do, it is also clear that God is the initiator of these spiritual pursuits. Jesus said that no one can come to Him unless the Father first draws them (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/6/John-6-44.html"&gt;John 6:44&lt;/a&gt;). This concept can be understood through several parables that Jesus shared to illustrate God's pursuit of mankind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Initiation of God's Pursuit&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the very beginning, God has pursued us. After Adam and Eve sinned, they did not run towards God but instead hid among the trees of the garden. However, God did not give up on them. He called out to them, asking "Where are you?" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/3/Genesis-3-9.html"&gt;Genesis 3:9&lt;/a&gt;). This act of seeking them out exemplifies God's heart of reconciliation and His desire to have a relationship with His creation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Parables Illustrating God's Pursuit&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus used parables such as the lost sheep and the lost coin to teach about God's pursuit of us. In these parables, Jesus emphasized that God knows each person intimately and values them greatly. He highlighted the importance of every individual by comparing them to a lost sheep or a lost coin. Just as a shepherd would leave his flock to search for one lost sheep, God actively pursues each one of us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Ultimate Act of Pursuit&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God's pursuit of us culminated in the sending of His beloved Son, Jesus Christ, to die in our place (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/3/John-3-16.html"&gt;John 3:16&lt;/a&gt;–18; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/2-Corinthians/5/2-Corinthians-5-21.html"&gt;2 Corinthians 5:21&lt;/a&gt;; 9:15). We were unable to reach God through our own efforts, so He reached down to us. This act of sacrifice demonstrates the extent to which God is willing to pursue us and reconcile us to Himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;God's Pursuit Despite Our Obstinacy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IqKXH_MhJXg" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even when we are obstinate and resistant, God continues to pursue us. In the book of Isaiah, the Lord reveals that He revealed Himself to those who did not ask for Him and was found by those who did not seek Him. He held out His hands to an obstinate people who continually provoked Him (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/65/Isaiah-65-1.html"&gt;Isaiah 65:1&lt;/a&gt;–3). This demonstrates God's persistent pursuit of humanity, even when we turn away from Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Jesus' Pursuit of His Creation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus walked among the people He loved and lamented their spiritual stubbornness. He expressed His longing to gather the people of Jerusalem together, but they were unwilling (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/23/Matthew-23-37.html"&gt;Matthew 23:37&lt;/a&gt;). Jesus came in the flesh to pursue those He had created, but many rejected Him (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/1/John-1-11.html"&gt;John 1:11&lt;/a&gt;–13). However, God's message of redemption has gone out to the whole world, and salvation is available to all who believe (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/3/John-3-16.html"&gt;John 3:16&lt;/a&gt;; 12:46; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/1/Romans-1-16.html"&gt;Romans 1:16&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Continuation of God's Pursuit&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through His followers, Jesus has continued to pursue men and women from every era, nation, tribe, and tongue. The disciples were instructed to be witnesses to the ends of the earth (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Acts/1/Acts-1-8.html"&gt;Acts 1:8&lt;/a&gt;), and since then, believers have spread the good news that God is pursuing a relationship with them. The pursuit of God extends to believers today through the indwelling Holy Spirit. Through the Holy Spirit, God comforts, corrects, and compels His children to obey His Word. He disciplines us as part of His work in conforming us to the image of His Son (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/8/Romans-8-29.html"&gt;Romans 8:29&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/12/Hebrews-12-5.html"&gt;Hebrews 12:5&lt;/a&gt;–7).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding that God pursues us is essential because it reveals His love and desire for a relationship with us. It reminds us that our salvation is not based on our own efforts but on God's grace. Recognizing God's pursuit can also motivate us to respond to His love by seeking a deeper relationship with Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider the significance of God pursuing us even when we are obstinate or resistant. How does this revelation of God's character impact your view of Him? How can you respond to God's pursuit in your own life?&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/God's Relationship to Us/He Cares For Us"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Divine Presence: God Is With Us Every Step of the Way</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/god-is-with-us/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-08-01T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-08-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-08-01:/god-is-with-us/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;God is with Us&lt;/h2&gt;

He is with …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;God is with Us&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept of God's presence is a fundamental aspect of the Christian faith. It brings comfort, assurance, and guidance to believers. The Bible teaches us that God is not a distant and detached deity, but rather He is intimately involved in our lives. He is with us in every circumstance, offering His love, wisdom, and power. Understanding this truth can have a profound impact on our relationship with God and how we navigate through life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1. God's Omnipresence&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of God's attributes is His omnipresence, which means that He is everywhere at all times. This concept can be challenging for us to fully comprehend, but it reveals the extent of God's involvement in His creation. He is universally present in person, understanding, and power. As &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Acts/17/Acts-17-27.html"&gt;Acts 17:27&lt;/a&gt; tells us, "He is not far from any one of us." This means that no matter where we are or what we are going through, God is with us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2. God's Indwelling Presence&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a more personal level, God's presence is experienced by believers through the indwelling of the Holy Spirit. This indwelling occurs when we are born again and accept Jesus Christ as our Savior. &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/3/John-3-3.html"&gt;John 3:3&lt;/a&gt; emphasizes the importance of being born again to receive the Holy Spirit. First &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/5/John-5-11.html"&gt;John 5:11-12&lt;/a&gt; further explains that eternal life is found in Jesus Christ, and whoever has Him also has life. Additionally, Jesus promised in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/14/John-14-23.html"&gt;John 14:23&lt;/a&gt; that if we love Him and obey His teachings, both He and the Father will come to make their home with us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The apostle Paul affirms this truth in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Galatians/2/Galatians-2-20.html"&gt;Galatians 2:20&lt;/a&gt;, stating that Christ lives in him. Furthermore, in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Galatians/3/Galatians-3-5.html"&gt;Galatians 3:5&lt;/a&gt;, Paul explains that believers have received the Spirit from God. This indwelling presence of God is a remarkable reality that allows us to commune with Him and experience His power, wisdom, and guidance in our daily lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9kWk_Wu-wKM" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;3. Immanuel - God with Us&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Immanuel is one of the titles given to Jesus, which means "God with us" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/1/Matthew-1-23.html"&gt;Matthew 1:23&lt;/a&gt;). When Jesus came into the world, He was truly God in human form, demonstrating God's desire to be intimately involved in humanity. This truth is significant because it assures us that we will never be separated from God's love (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/8/Romans-8-38.html"&gt;Romans 8:38-39&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus' presence in our lives enables us to accomplish God's will for us. In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-Chronicles/22/1-Chronicles-22-17.html"&gt;1 Chronicles 22:17-19&lt;/a&gt;, we see how David encouraged his son Solomon to seek God's presence and follow His instructions. This assurance of God's presence also overcomes our fears, worries, and dissatisfaction (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/13/Hebrews-13-5.html"&gt;Hebrews 13:5&lt;/a&gt;). Knowing that God is with us provides comfort and security in all circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding that God is always with us has several implications for our faith and daily lives. Firstly, it reminds us of the closeness of our relationship with God. He desires to communicate and commune with us on a personal level. This knowledge should motivate us to seek Him diligently through prayer, studying His Word, and seeking godly counsel from pastors and fellow believers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, recognizing God's presence should impact our perspective on life. Instead of relying solely on our own strength and understanding, we can lean on God's guidance and trust in His wisdom. The indwelling Holy Spirit empowers us to live a life that pleases God and bears the fruit of the Spirit (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Galatians/5/Galatians-5-22.html"&gt;Galatians 5:22-23&lt;/a&gt;). It reminds us that we are not alone; we have a constant companion who leads, comforts, and empowers us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider the significance of knowing that God is with you at all times. How does this truth impact your perspective on challenges, fears, and uncertainties? In what practical ways can you cultivate a deeper awareness of God's presence in your daily life?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The assurance that God is with us is a foundational truth in the Christian faith. It reveals His omnipresence and indwelling presence through the Holy Spirit. This understanding should shape our relationship with God and our approach to life. Knowing that God is always with us brings comfort, guidance, and empowerment. It reminds us of the closeness of our relationship with Him, encourages us to seek Him diligently, and enables us to live a life that pleases Him. May we continually cultivate an awareness of God's presence and rely on His wisdom and power in every aspect of our lives.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/God's Relationship to Us/He Cares For Us"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Is God Mad at Me? Understanding Divine Love and Forgiveness</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/is-god-mad-at-me/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-07-29T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-07-29T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-07-29:/is-god-mad-at-me/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Is God Mad at Me?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Christians, we may sometimes question whether God is angry with us. This is often based on our own feelings of guilt or when we experience difficulties in life. However, it is important to understand how God's anger differs from human anger and to recognize …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Is God Mad at Me?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Christians, we may sometimes question whether God is angry with us. This is often based on our own feelings of guilt or when we experience difficulties in life. However, it is important to understand how God's anger differs from human anger and to recognize His immense love and mercy towards us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Understanding God's Anger&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God's anger is not petty or temperamental. It is based on His holiness and is a just response to violations of His character. Unlike human anger, which often fails to produce righteousness, God's anger is motivated by righteousness and is never out of proportion. He is not threatened or belittled by us because He is all-powerful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Bible, we see numerous examples of God's anger being aroused over sin and the destruction it brings. However, even in His anger, God's love and mercy are evident. He delivered His people from oppression many times and took note of their distress. He sent prophets to warn them and always preserved a remnant. Ultimately, God provided a way of restoration through the promised Messiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;God's Patience and Love&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God's anger has a limit, and there is always the prospect of forgiveness for those who repent. He is patient with us because He desires everyone to come to repentance. When we put our faith in Jesus Christ, we no longer need to fear God's wrath. Through Christ, we have peace with God, and nothing can separate us from His love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Eq6LECrhCv8" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is important to note that even though we are saved by grace through faith in Jesus Christ, sin still has consequences in this world. We may still experience the natural consequences of our wrongdoing or endure the effects of living in a fallen world. However, these consequences are not indicators of God's anger towards us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;God's Discipline and Our Growth&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, when we go through difficulties or feel distant from God, it is an opportunity for self-reflection and examination of our hearts and lives. God may discipline us as His children to produce righteousness, peace, and perseverance. We can endure trials with joy, knowing that they refine us and grow us to be more like Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In these moments, we should turn to God in prayer and rest in the promises of His Word. We can trust in His unchanging nature and the depth of His love. Instead of worrying whether God is mad at us, we should focus on seeking forgiveness, relying on God's grace, and living in accordance with His will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding God's anger and His love for us is crucial for our relationship with Him. It helps us avoid misconceptions about His character and dispels fear or guilt that may hinder our faith. Recognizing that God's anger is motivated by righteousness and that He always provides a path to forgiveness encourages us to seek reconciliation with Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does understanding God's anger and love affect your view of Him?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have you ever mistaken the natural consequences of sin or difficulties in life as indicators of God's anger? How can you remind yourself of His mercy and love in those moments?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reflect on a time when you experienced discipline from God. How did it shape your character or draw you closer to Him?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can you cultivate a deeper trust in God's unchanging nature and love for you?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember, as believers in Jesus Christ, we can have confidence that God is not mad at us. He has shown His love for us through Christ's sacrifice, and through Him, we have been reconciled to God. Let us rest in His love, seek forgiveness when needed, and live with gratitude for His mercy and grace.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/God's Relationship to Us/He Cares For Us"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Divine Love Unveiled: Understanding God's Unconditional Love for Christians</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/god-love/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-07-19T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-07-19T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-07-19:/god-love/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;God's Love: Understanding the Depth of His Love for Us&lt;/h2&gt;

While it is impossible for us as humans to fully comprehend the depths of God's love, one thing is certain: God's love is not …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;God's Love: Understanding the Depth of His Love for Us&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God's love for humanity is a profound and complex topic that has been contemplated for centuries. While it is impossible for us as humans to fully comprehend the depths of God's love, one thing is certain: God's love is not based on our loveliness or our deserving nature. In fact, it is quite the opposite. The state of humanity since the fall has been marked by rebellion and disobedience. Our hearts are deceitful and desperately wicked, making it impossible for us to seek, love, or desire God (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Jeremiah/17/Jeremiah-17-9.html"&gt;Jeremiah 17:9&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/3/Romans-3-10.html"&gt;Romans 3:10-12&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1. God's Essential Nature as Love&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bible tells us that "God is love" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-John/4/1-John-4-8.html"&gt;1 John 4:8&lt;/a&gt;, 16). This declaration is of utmost importance - it means that love is not just something God does, but it is an essential aspect of His being. Love permeates God's nature and infuses all His other attributes, including His wrath and anger. God's love is not a sappy, sentimental feeling; it is sacrificial and selfless (agape love). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think about it: Just as a fire radiates warmth and light, so does God radiate love because it is inherent to His nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2. God's Demonstration of Love&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because God's nature is love, He must demonstrate it to bring glory to Himself. Glorifying God is the highest and noblest act, and since He deserves all glory, He must demonstrate all His attributes. One powerful way in which God demonstrates His love is through the sacrificial act of sending His Son, Jesus Christ, to pay the penalty for our sins (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-John/4/1-John-4-10.html"&gt;1 John 4:10&lt;/a&gt;). This act reveals the extent of His love for us while we were still sinners (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/5/Romans-5-8.html"&gt;Romans 5:8&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why this matters: God's demonstration of love through the sacrifice of Jesus Christ is what sets Christianity apart from other religions. It reveals the depth of God's personal and sacrificial love for each individual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;3. God's Personal and Unconditional Love&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;God's love is not impersonal; it is deeply personal. He knows each one of us individually and loves us personally. His love has no beginning and no end. Despite our rebellion and sinfulness, God's love remains steadfast and unchanging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think about it: Imagine a loving parent who deeply cares for their child, despite the child's mistakes and shortcomings. In the same way, God's love for us is unconditional and unwavering, even in our brokenness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;4. God's Love as a Transforming Power&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God's love has the power to transform us from within. When we accept His love and surrender our lives to Him, He forgives us of our rebellion against Him and sends His Holy Spirit to dwell within us. This indwelling Spirit enables us to love others as He loves us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why this matters: Experiencing God's love and allowing it to transform us is at the core of the Christian faith. It empowers us to extend that same sacrificial love to others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;5. Understanding Love in Light of God's Holiness&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God's holiness also plays a crucial role in understanding His love. His holiness demands justice for sin, but His love provides a way for forgiveness and reconciliation. This is seen in Jesus' sacrificial death on the cross, where God's justice was satisfied, and His love was poured out for humanity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think about it: Imagine a courtroom where a guilty person stands before a judge. The judge, who is both just and loving, imposes a just penalty but also offers to pay it on behalf of the guilty person. This exemplifies how God's holiness and love intersect in the person of Jesus Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;6. Responding to God's Love&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God's love is not meant to be merely acknowledged; it calls for a response. When we truly grasp the depth of His love, we are compelled to respond by loving Him in return and loving others as He loves us. This response includes obedience to His commandments, seeking a personal relationship with Him, and living a life that reflects His love and character.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why this matters: Understanding and responding to God's love transforms our lives and enables us to experience the abundant life He desires for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, while we may never fully comprehend the depths of God's love, we can be assured that it is personal, sacrificial, and unconditional. God's essential nature as love compels Him to demonstrate His love for us through the sacrifice of Jesus Christ. This sacrificial act reveals the extent of His love, providing a way for forgiveness and transformation. Understanding and responding to God's love is at the heart of the Christian faith, enabling us to experience His abundant life and share His love with others.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/God's Relationship to Us/He Cares For Us"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>All Things Are Possible: Unleashing God's Limitless Power in Your Life</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/all-things-are-possible/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-06-29T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-06-29T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-06-29:/all-things-are-possible/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;All Things Are Possible&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept that "all things are possible" is often associated with the omnipotence of God. While it is true that God has the power to do anything He wishes, there are certain limitations to what He will do. This is because God's actions are guided by …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;All Things Are Possible&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept that "all things are possible" is often associated with the omnipotence of God. While it is true that God has the power to do anything He wishes, there are certain limitations to what He will do. This is because God's actions are guided by His holy will and are not contradictory to His purposes. God is completely holy and sinless, so He will not commit any sinful acts. It is important to understand that just because God has the power to do something, it does not mean that He will actually do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An example that illustrates this is the question, "Can God make a stone so heavy that He can't lift it?" This question presents a paradox. If God is so powerful that He can create a stone of infinite weight, how would it be possible for Him not to be able to lift it? On the other hand, if the stone is truly of infinite weight, how would it be possible for Him to lift it? The answer lies in the fact that God will not deny Himself. In this case, it seems that He would not even consider such an idea because it would be pitting Himself against Himself, which serves no purpose in His kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout the Bible, we see evidence of God's omnipotence. In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Joshua/4/Joshua-4-24.html"&gt;Joshua 4:24&lt;/a&gt;, we read about how God made a dry path in the mighty Jordan River to allow His people to pass safely. This was done so that all the peoples of the earth might know that the hand of the Lord is powerful and worthy of fear. &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Jeremiah/32/Jeremiah-32-26.html"&gt;Jeremiah 32:26-27&lt;/a&gt; also affirms God's power, stating, "Then the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah: 'I am the LORD, the God of all mankind. Is anything too hard for me?'" These verses and others make it clear that all things within God's will are possible for Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is worth noting that the angel in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/1/Luke-1-36.html"&gt;Luke 1:36-37&lt;/a&gt; proclaimed to Mary, "For nothing is impossible with God." Some may wonder if this means that they can run faster than a car or leap tall buildings. While it is within God's power to make those things possible, there is nothing in Scripture that indicates it is His desire to do so. Just because something is possible for God does not mean that He is obligated to make it happen. Therefore, it is important for us to be familiar with Scripture and understand what God desires and has promised so that we can know what He will make possible in our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EqYBXFYYsxc" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Understanding the concept of God's omnipotence and the limitations of His actions is important for our faith. It helps us to have a proper perspective of who God is and how He works in the world. Knowing that God can do anything within His will gives us confidence and assurance that He is in control, even in situations that seem impossible to us. It also helps us to align our desires with God's desires and seek His will in our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reflect on times in your life when you have witnessed or experienced the power of God. How did these experiences shape your understanding of His omnipotence?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consider the paradoxical question about the stone that God cannot lift. What does this teach us about the nature of God and His actions?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does knowing that "nothing is impossible with God" impact your prayers and expectations? How can you align your desires with His will?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, while God has the power to do anything He wishes, there are limitations to what He will do. His actions are guided by His holy will and are not contradictory to His purposes. Understanding the concept of God's omnipotence helps us to have a proper perspective of who He is and how He works in the world. We can have confidence that nothing is too hard for Him and that He is in control, even in situations that seem impossible to us. As we seek His will and align our desires with His, we can trust that He will make all things possible according to His glorious purposes.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/God's Relationship to Us/He Cares For Us"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Ultimate Refuge: God's Unfailing Protection for Christians</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/god-our-refuge/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-06-03T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-06-03T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-06-03:/god-our-refuge/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;God Our Refuge&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we think of a refuge, we often picture a safe place, like a fortified building or a canopy protecting us from a rainstorm. In the Bible, God is described as our refuge, a place of safety and protection. Trusting in God as our refuge allows us to face any situation without fear, knowing that He is in control. "The name of the LORD is a fortified tower; the righteous run to it and are safe" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Proverbs/18/Proverbs-18-10.html"&gt;Proverbs 18:10&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How Do We Make God Our Refuge?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It may seem challenging to make an unseen God our refuge, but we can learn from the example of David. Even when he was pursued and threatened with death, David found safety in God. He poured out his heart to God and trusted Him completely. To make God our refuge, we can follow David's example by seeking Him in prayer and pouring out our hearts to Him. When we turn to God for help and protection, we begin to know Him as our refuge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast to David's faith, the leaders of Israel in Isaiah's time sought security in things other than God. However, these false refuges could not provide true safety. God offers a genuine refuge—a tested stone, a sure foundation—for those who rely on Him. We may be tempted to find security in worldly things, but only God can truly protect us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_x_C-nnbxrc" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Trusting God in Difficult Situations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trusting in God as our refuge does not mean that He will shield us from all difficult or dangerous situations. However, when we are in His will, we can face any challenge with confidence because He is with us. Just as Jesus led the disciples into a boat during a violent storm, He calmed their fears and demonstrated that He was their refuge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We see countless examples throughout the Bible of God leading His people into battles against seemingly insurmountable odds. Yet, when they trusted and obeyed God, they always emerged victorious. Jesus reminds us that although we will face trouble in this world, we can find peace in Him because He has overcome the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding God as our refuge is crucial for our spiritual well-being. When we recognize that God is our safe place, we can trust Him more freely and face any situation without fear. We don't have to rely on false refuges that promise security but ultimately fail to deliver. Instead, we can find true safety and protection in God alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowing God as our refuge also strengthens our relationship with Him. Just as David poured out his heart to God, we can do the same. When we turn to God in prayer and seek His guidance and protection, we deepen our connection with Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reflect on a time when you felt scared or vulnerable. How did you seek refuge? Did you turn to God or rely on something else?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are there any false refuges in your life that you have been relying on for security? How can you shift your trust back to God as your refuge?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider the challenges you are currently facing. How might viewing God as your refuge change your perspective and approach to these difficulties?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take a moment to pour out your heart to God and ask Him to be your refuge in every situation. Trust that He is always with you, protecting and guiding you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, God is our refuge—a safe place where we can find protection, peace, and strength. By seeking Him in prayer, pouring out our hearts, and trusting in His guidance, we can experience the security that comes from knowing Him as our refuge. In all circumstances, whether easy or challenging, the safest place to be is in the center of God's will. He promises never to leave or forsake us, so we can confidently say, "The Lord is my helper; I will not be afraid. What can man do to me?"

While …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;God Still Speaks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Bible, there are numerous instances where God speaks audibly to people, such as Moses at the burning bush (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Exodus/3/Exodus-3-14.html"&gt;Exodus 3:14&lt;/a&gt;), Joshua before entering the Promised Land (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Joshua/1/Joshua-1-1.html"&gt;Joshua 1:1&lt;/a&gt;), and Samuel when he was called to be a prophet (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-Samuel/3/1-Samuel-3-11.html"&gt;1 Samuel 3:11&lt;/a&gt;). While these examples show that God has spoken audibly in the past, it is important to note that they occurred over a span of 4,000 years of human history and are exceptions rather than the norm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;God Speaks Through His Word&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One primary way that God speaks to us today is through His Word, the Bible. The Bible is often referred to as the "Word of God" because it contains everything we need to know in order to be saved and live a Christian life. In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/2-Timothy/3/2-Timothy-3-16.html"&gt;2 Timothy 3:16&lt;/a&gt;–17, it says, "All Scripture is breathed out by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness, that the man of God may be complete, equipped for every good work." This passage emphasizes the divine inspiration and authority of the Scriptures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bible is not just a collection of ancient writings; it is a living and relevant book that continues to speak to us today. When we read and study the Bible, we can hear God's voice addressing our hearts and minds. &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/55/Isaiah-55-11.html"&gt;Isaiah 55:11&lt;/a&gt; assures us that God's Word will accomplish what He desires and achieve its purpose. So, if we want to hear from God, we need to spend time reading and meditating on His Word.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Understanding that God speaks through His Word helps us develop a deeper relationship with Him. By studying the Scriptures, we gain insight into His character, His will for our lives, and how we should live as followers of Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; How often do you spend time reading and studying the Bible? Are there specific passages or books that you find particularly meaningful or helpful in your spiritual journey?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;God Speaks Through Events and Circumstances&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another way that God speaks to us is through events and circumstances in our lives. God can guide us by arranging our circumstances in a way that leads us in a specific direction or teaches us important lessons. Although we may not always recognize it at the time, looking back, we can often see how God was working through various situations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God also speaks to us through our consciences. He has given us an innate sense of right and wrong, which helps us discern His will. The apostle Paul writes in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-Timothy/1/1-Timothy-1-5.html"&gt;1 Timothy 1:5&lt;/a&gt;, "The aim of our charge is love that issues from a pure heart and a good conscience and a sincere faith." Our consciences serve as a moral compass, guiding us in making decisions that align with God's principles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Recognizing that God can speak through events and circumstances reminds us that He is actively involved in our lives. It encourages us to trust Him even when things seem uncertain or challenging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/W65PdAEKfHk" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; Can you think of a time when you felt that God was speaking to you through a particular event or circumstance? How did it impact your faith or decision-making process?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Conforming Our Minds to Think Like God&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the ways that God speaks to us is by conforming our minds to think like Him. &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/12/Romans-12-2.html"&gt;Romans 12:2&lt;/a&gt; urges believers, "Do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewal of your mind, that by testing you may discern what is the will of God, what is good and acceptable and perfect." As we grow in our relationship with Him, our thoughts and perspectives should align more closely with His.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God allows various events and trials to occur in our lives to shape and mold us spiritually. &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/James/1/James-1-2.html"&gt;James 1:2&lt;/a&gt;–5 encourages us to consider trials as opportunities for growth: "Count it all joy, my brothers, when you meet trials of various kinds, for you know that the testing of your faith produces steadfastness. And let steadfastness have its full effect, that you may be perfect and complete, lacking in nothing."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Understanding that God wants to transform our minds helps us develop a biblical worldview and make decisions that align with His will. It reminds us that He is actively involved in our personal growth and sanctification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; In what areas of your life do you feel like your thoughts or perspectives need to align more closely with God's? How can you pursue renewing your mind and seeking His will in those areas?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Discernment and Comparing with the Bible&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While God may still occasionally speak audibly to people today, it is important to exercise discernment and compare any claims of such experiences with what the Bible teaches. Just as there were false prophets and false teachers in biblical times, there are also many voices claiming to speak for God today. Therefore, it is crucial to test everything against the ultimate authority of God's Word.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/2-Timothy/3/2-Timothy-3-16.html"&gt;2 Timothy 3:16&lt;/a&gt;–17, we are reminded that all Scripture is God-breathed and serves as the standard by which we evaluate any claims of divine communication. If someone claims to have heard from God, their words should align with what is taught in the Bible. The Bible is our foundation and guide, providing us with truth, wisdom, and discernment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Having a discerning spirit protects us from being led astray by false teachings or misleading claims of divine communication. It helps us stay grounded in the truth of God's Word.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; Are there any popular teachings or claims of divine communication that you have encountered that seem to contradict or deviate from the teachings of the Bible? How can you guard yourself against being influenced by such teachings?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While God may still speak audibly to people today, such instances are exceptions rather than the norm. Instead, God primarily speaks to us through His Word, the Bible. By studying and meditating on His Word, we can hear His voice addressing our hearts and minds. Additionally, God communicates through events and circumstances in our lives, shaping us and guiding us along His path. As we grow in our relationship with Him and renew our minds, we become more attuned to His will and develop a biblical worldview. However, it is crucial that we exercise discernment and compare any claims of divine communication with the teachings of the Bible to ensure they align with God's truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Recognizing that God still speaks today encourages us to seek Him through His Word and be attentive to His guidance in our lives. It deepens our relationship with Him and helps us navigate the complexities of life with confidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; How can you cultivate a deeper sensitivity to hearing God's voice through His Word and in the events of your life? What steps can you take to develop a discerning spirit that aligns with biblical truth?&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/God's Relationship to Us/He Cares For Us"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Understanding the Jealous God: Revealing His Divine Love</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/jealous-god/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-04-07T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-04-07T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-04-07:/jealous-god/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;The Jealousy of God&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we hear the word "jealous," we typically associate it with feelings of envy or possessiveness. However, when the Bible describes God as a jealous God, it carries a different meaning. In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Exodus/20/Exodus-20-5.html"&gt;Exodus 20:5&lt;/a&gt;, we read, "You shall not bow down to them or worship …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;The Jealousy of God&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we hear the word "jealous," we typically associate it with feelings of envy or possessiveness. However, when the Bible describes God as a jealous God, it carries a different meaning. In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Exodus/20/Exodus-20-5.html"&gt;Exodus 20:5&lt;/a&gt;, we read, "You shall not bow down to them or worship them; for I, the LORD your God, am a jealous God." This passage refers to God's jealousy when people give worship and devotion to something or someone other than Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What Jealousy Means in this Context&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The jealousy of God is not rooted in envy or a desire for something He lacks. Instead, it is a righteous jealousy that arises when what rightfully belongs to Him is given to another. In this case, God is jealous for the worship and service that only He deserves. Just as a husband has the exclusive right to flirt with his wife, so does God have the exclusive right to be worshiped and adored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God's jealousy is not sinful or selfish; it is a response to the violation of His rightful place as the one true God. When people turn away from Him and worship idols, they are robbing God of the praise and honor that are rightfully His alone. This is why He describes Himself as a jealous God - He desires that His people recognize and worship Him as their Creator and Savior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Understanding Biblical Idolatry&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Idolatry refers to the act of worshiping or serving something other than God. In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Exodus/20/Exodus-20-4.html"&gt;Exodus 20:4-5&lt;/a&gt;, God specifically warns against making idols in any form and bowing down to them. This commandment reflects His jealousy for the exclusive worship that belongs to Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Idolatry can take many forms in our lives today. It may involve placing material possessions, achievements, or even other people above our devotion to God. When we prioritize anything above our relationship with Him, we are essentially worshiping idols. God's jealousy is a reminder that He alone deserves our complete worship and adoration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Consequences of Idolatry&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Idolatry is a serious offense in the eyes of God, and He warns of the consequences that come with it. In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Exodus/20/Exodus-20-5.html"&gt;Exodus 20:5&lt;/a&gt;, God declares that He will visit "the iniquity of the fathers on the children to the third and fourth generations." This means that the consequences of idolatry can extend beyond the individuals who commit it and affect future generations as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0_4ftuQxhio" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While God's punishment may seem severe, it serves as a deterrent to idolatry and a reminder of His holiness. He desires that His people remain devoted to Him alone and not be led astray by false gods. By understanding the seriousness of idolatry, we can better appreciate God's jealousy for our worship and strive to honor Him above all else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Jealousy vs. Sinful Jealousy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to differentiate between God's jealousy and sinful jealousy. Sinful jealousy arises when we desire something that does not rightfully belong to us. It can manifest in feelings of envy or resentment towards others who possess what we desire, such as wealth, beauty, or talent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast, God's jealousy is rooted in His rightful claim over our worship and devotion. He is jealous when we give these things to anything or anyone other than Him because they rightfully belong to Him alone. His jealousy is an expression of His love for us and His desire for us to experience the fullness of His presence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the jealousy of God provides us with important insights into our relationship with Him. It reminds us that worshiping anything other than God is a violation of His commandments and a denial of His rightful place in our lives. It also highlights the seriousness of idolatry and the consequences it can have on future generations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recognizing God's jealousy allows us to deepen our understanding of His character. It reveals His desire for an intimate and exclusive relationship with His people. By acknowledging His jealousy, we can respond by giving Him the worship and adoration that He rightly deserves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does the concept of God's jealousy challenge your understanding of His character?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have you ever prioritized something or someone above your devotion to God? Reflect on how this may have affected your relationship with Him.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In what ways can you ensure that you are worshiping God alone and not falling into idolatry? Consider practical steps you can take to prioritize Him above all else.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By contemplating these questions and seeking a deeper understanding of God's jealousy, we can grow in our faith and develop a more intimate relationship with Him.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/God's Relationship to Us/He Cares For Us"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Divine Sustenance: God's Unfailing Support for Believers</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/god-is-our-sustainer/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-04-01T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-04-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-04-01:/god-is-our-sustainer/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;God is Our Sustainer&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout Scripture, God is described as the one who sustains all things. When we say that God is our sustainer, we mean that He gives us strength, protection, encouragement, and comfort. His power to sustain surpasses any human effort. As believers, we are adopted into God's family through Jesus Christ, becoming His children. In difficult times, God sustains us and helps us. The psalmists often expressed their reliance on God's sustaining power when they faced weariness or distress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Sustained by God's Strength&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On our own, our strength is finite and limited. We may try to gain strength from worldly things, but they will always disappoint and leave us emptier than before. Only God, the infinite and limitless Creator, can sustain us. When we feel like we are falling apart or have nothing left to give, we must turn to Him for help. God is the source of unending and sustaining strength.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Creator Who Holds All Things Together&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only does God sustain us individually, but He also sustains all things in the universe. The physical laws that hold matter together and keep planets in their positions are sustained by Him. This includes the laws that bind people to the earth. In fact, everything in creation is held together through Jesus Christ. He is the one who keeps everything aligned and functioning according to His divine plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding that God is our sustainer has significant implications for our lives as believers. It reminds us of our dependency on Him and encourages us to turn to Him for help and strength. When we face challenges or feel overwhelmed, we can trust in God's sustaining power to carry us through. It also points to the greatness of our Creator who not only sustains us individually but also upholds the entire universe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pause for a moment and reflect on how God has sustained you in the past. How has He given you strength, protection, encouragement, and comfort? Take time to thank Him for His faithfulness in sustaining you. And when you find yourself facing difficulties or feeling weak, remember that God is always there to sustain you once again. Trust in His power and seek His help.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/God's Relationship to Us/He Cares For Us"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry></feed>

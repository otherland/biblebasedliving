&lt;p&gt;We live in a world filled with pain and suffering. It is a reality that affects everyone, and one of the most difficult questions in theology is why bad things happen to good people. As humans, we are limited in our understanding of God's purposes and ways. We cannot fully comprehend His plans as we are not eternal, infinite, or omniscient like Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Example of Job&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book of Job in the Bible deals with the issue of why God allows bad things to happen to good people. Job was a righteous man who suffered immensely. God allowed Satan to afflict Job with unimaginable pain and loss, except for taking his life. Despite his suffering, Job maintained his trust in God, saying, "Though he slay me, yet will I hope in him" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Job/13/Job-13-15.html"&gt;Job 13:15&lt;/a&gt;). He acknowledged that even though he didn't understand why God allowed these things to happen, he knew that God was good and worthy of his trust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Reality of Sin&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When pondering why bad things happen to good people, it is essential to consider that there are no truly "good" people in an absolute sense. All of us are tainted by sin (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Ecclesiastes/7/Ecclesiastes-7-20.html"&gt;Ecclesiastes 7:20&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/3/Romans-3-23.html"&gt;Romans 3:23&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-John/1/1-John-1-8.html"&gt;1 John 1:8&lt;/a&gt;). Jesus Himself said, "No one is good—except God alone" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/18/Luke-18-19.html"&gt;Luke 18:19&lt;/a&gt;). We all experience the consequences of sin, whether it's our own personal sin or the sins committed by others. We live in a fallen world where injustice and seemingly senseless suffering exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Four Perspectives on Bad Things Happening&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eternal Perspective:&lt;/strong&gt; Although bad things may happen to good people in this world, we must remember that this world is not the end. As Christians, we have an eternal perspective. Our present troubles are temporary, and we look forward to the eternal glory awaiting us (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/2-Corinthians/4/2-Corinthians-4-16.html"&gt;2 Corinthians 4:16&lt;/a&gt;–18). We have the assurance that there will be a reward for our faithfulness, and it will be glorious.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Maintaining an eternal perspective helps us endure present suffering and find hope in the midst of trials. It reminds us that our ultimate home is in heaven, where there will be no more pain or suffering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; How does knowing that our present troubles are temporary change our perspective on the challenges we face?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;God's Ultimate Good:&lt;/strong&gt; Although bad things happen to good people, God can use those very things for an ultimate and lasting good (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/8/Romans-8-28.html"&gt;Romans 8:28&lt;/a&gt;). The story of Joseph in the Bible illustrates this truth. Joseph, innocent of any wrongdoing, endured immense suffering but eventually saw God's good plan unfold (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/50/Genesis-50-19.html"&gt;Genesis 50:19&lt;/a&gt;–21).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Recognizing that God can bring good out of even the most painful circumstances gives us hope and assurance. We can trust that He is working all things together for our good, even when we cannot see the bigger picture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; Can you think of a time when you experienced something difficult but later realized how it led to something positive in your life?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AndXsPdvHCM" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deeper Ministry:&lt;/strong&gt; Bad things happening to good people can equip believers for deeper ministry. As we experience God's comfort and healing in our own troubles, we are better able to comfort others going through similar situations (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/2-Corinthians/1/2-Corinthians-1-3.html"&gt;2 Corinthians 1:3&lt;/a&gt;–5). Our own experiences of suffering allow us to empathize with and support those who are hurting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Our personal experiences of pain and suffering can become sources of strength and encouragement for others. God can use our trials to bring comfort and healing to those who need it most.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; How have you been able to support or encourage someone going through a difficult time based on your own experiences?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jesus' Example:&lt;/strong&gt; The worst things happened to the best Person—Jesus Christ. He was the only truly righteous One, yet He suffered more than we can imagine. Jesus' suffering and death on the cross demonstrate His love for us and provide an example for us to follow (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-Peter/2/1-Peter-2-20.html"&gt;1 Peter 2:20&lt;/a&gt;–23). He entrusted Himself to God, even in the midst of great suffering.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Jesus' suffering shows us that we are not alone in our pain. He understands our struggles and is with us every step of the way. We can find comfort and strength in knowing that Jesus has faced the worst of human suffering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; How does Jesus' example of enduring suffering without retaliation inspire you in your own struggles?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Trusting in God's Goodness&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, we may never fully understand why bad things happen to good people in this fallen world. Yet, as Christians, we can trust in the goodness, justice, love, and mercy of God (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/135/Psalm-135-3.html"&gt;Psalm 135:3&lt;/a&gt;). It is important to remember that God is working all things according to His purposes, even when His ways are beyond our comprehension.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When faced with trials and suffering, we are called to trust in the Lord with all our hearts and lean not on our own understanding (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Proverbs/3/Proverbs-3-5.html"&gt;Proverbs 3:5&lt;/a&gt;–6). We walk by faith, not by sight. While we may not always understand why certain things happen, we can find comfort in knowing that God is always with us, even in the darkest moments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Trusting in God's goodness and sovereignty allows us to find peace and hope amidst life's difficulties. It anchors us in times of uncertainty and strengthens our faith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; How can you cultivate a deeper trust in God's goodness and sovereignty, even when faced with difficult circumstances?&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/God and Evil/Hardships"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Why Do Christians Suffer: Unveiling the Purpose Behind Pain</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/why-do-christians-suffer/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-09-18T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-09-18T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-09-18:/why-do-christians-suffer/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Why Do Christians Suffer?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suffering is an inevitable part of the Christian life. Jesus Himself warned His followers that they would face trouble in this world (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/16/John-16-33.html"&gt;John 16:33&lt;/a&gt;). However, Christians have a unique perspective on suffering, and there are several reasons why they may experience it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1. The Brokenness …&lt;/h3&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Why Do Christians Suffer?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suffering is an inevitable part of the Christian life. Jesus Himself warned His followers that they would face trouble in this world (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/16/John-16-33.html"&gt;John 16:33&lt;/a&gt;). However, Christians have a unique perspective on suffering, and there are several reasons why they may experience it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1. The Brokenness of the World&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One reason why Christians suffer is because they live in a broken and fallen world. When God originally created everything, it was "very good" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/1/Genesis-1-31.html"&gt;Genesis 1:31&lt;/a&gt;). However, sin entered the world through Adam's disobedience, and its effects continue to corrupt the world today (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/3/Romans-3-23.html"&gt;Romans 3:23&lt;/a&gt;; 6:23; 8:19–23). As a result, both Christians and non-Christians alike experience the difficulties and hardships of life on this broken planet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2. Non-Conformity to the World&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christians may also suffer because they stand for an uncompromising truth that the world often rejects. Jesus said, "If the world hates you, keep in mind that it hated me first" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/15/John-15-18.html"&gt;John 15:18&lt;/a&gt;). Believers represent the exclusive truth that Jesus Christ is the only way to God (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/14/John-14-6.html"&gt;John 14:6&lt;/a&gt;), which can be challenging for a world that promotes relativism and tolerance of all beliefs. This rejection can lead to various forms of suffering for Christians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;3. Refinement and Spiritual Growth&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One purpose of suffering for Christians is to refine their faith and character. The apostle Peter writes to encourage suffering Christians, saying that their trials test the genuineness of their faith, which is more valuable than gold (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-Peter/1/1-Peter-1-6.html"&gt;1 Peter 1:6-7&lt;/a&gt;). Similarly, James tells us to consider it pure joy when we face trials because they produce perseverance, maturity, and completeness in our faith (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/James/1/James-1-2.html"&gt;James 1:2&lt;/a&gt;–4). Through suffering, God can use temporary hardships to develop and strengthen His children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/b3ejvXVI_Kc" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;4. Discipline and Correction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, suffering can be a form of discipline from God. Just as a loving father disciplines his children, God disciplines those He loves (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/12/Hebrews-12-5.html"&gt;Hebrews 12:5&lt;/a&gt;–11). This discipline is not meant to harm or punish, but rather to correct and guide His children back onto the right path. It may involve allowing hardships or consequences to help believers readjust their priorities and turn their hearts back to Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;5. Comforting Others&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christians who have experienced suffering themselves are better equipped to empathize with and comfort others who are suffering. The apostle Paul writes that God comforts us in all our troubles so that we can comfort others with the same comfort we have received from Him (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/2-Corinthians/1/2-Corinthians-1-3.html"&gt;2 Corinthians 1:3&lt;/a&gt;–4). When believers go through trials, they can draw on their own experiences to offer support and encouragement to others who are facing similar challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;6. Drawing Closer to God&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suffering has a way of stripping away the temporal securities of this world and drawing Christians closer to the Lord. When everything else fails, believers are forced to seek solace, peace, and purpose in God's Word. It is during times of suffering that many Christians experience a deeper intimacy with God as they rely on Him for strength and find comfort in His presence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;7. Longing for Eternity&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suffering also reminds Christians that this world is not their ultimate home. While those in more affluent parts of the world may find it harder to long for heaven, Christians who suffer persecution, poverty, and privation often have a greater desire for eternity. When life is comfortable, the eternal perspective may fade into the background, but suffering can serve as a reminder that our hope lies not in this world but in God's greater plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding why Christians suffer is important because it helps believers navigate the challenges and hardships they encounter in life. By grasping the biblical perspective on suffering, Christians can find comfort, hope, and purpose in the midst of their trials. It also equips them to minister to others who are going through similar difficulties, offering them encouragement and pointing them to the hope found in Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does knowing that suffering is a part of the Christian life change your perspective on your own trials and hardships?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In what ways can you use your experiences of suffering to comfort and encourage others?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does the knowledge that this world is not our ultimate home impact your priorities and desires?&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On September 11, 2001, our world was forever changed by the tragic events that unfolded. Many people asked the question: Where was God in the midst of this terrible tragedy? As Christians, we believe that God is always present and in control, even in the face of evil and suffering. While it may be difficult to comprehend why a loving God would allow such a tragedy to happen, we must remember that God's ways are higher than our ways and His thoughts are higher than our thoughts (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/55/Isaiah-55-9.html"&gt;Isaiah 55:9&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Reality of Human Sinfulness&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To understand why God allows evil and suffering in our world, we must first acknowledge the reality of human sinfulness. The Bible tells us that all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/3/Romans-3-23.html"&gt;Romans 3:23&lt;/a&gt;). Humanity is desperately wicked and sinful (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/3/Romans-3-10.html"&gt;Romans 3:10-18&lt;/a&gt;). God allows human beings to commit sin for His own reasons and to fulfill His own purposes. This does not mean that God is responsible for the wicked acts of evil men.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;God's Eternal Perspective&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God looks at things from an eternal perspective, while we often view things from an earthly perspective. We may wonder why God allowed Adam and Eve to sin and bring evil, death, and suffering upon all mankind. However, it is important to remember that the purpose of all creation and all creatures is to glorify God. God is glorified when His nature and attributes are displayed. If there were no sin, God would have no opportunity to display His justice and wrath as He punishes sin. Nor would He have the opportunity to show His grace, mercy, and love to undeserving creatures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ultimate display of God's grace was seen at the Cross, where Jesus died for our sins. Here, unselfishness and obedience were displayed in God's Son, who knew no sin but was made sin for us so that we might become the righteousness of God in Him (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/2-Corinthians/5/2-Corinthians-5-21.html"&gt;2 Corinthians 5:21&lt;/a&gt;). This was all to the praise of His glory (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Ephesians/1/Ephesians-1-14.html"&gt;Ephesians 1:14&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Recognizing the Miracles Amidst Tragedy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When reflecting on September 11, it is easy to focus solely on the tragedy and forget the miracles that occurred that day. Despite the devastation, there were countless instances where lives were saved and people were able to escape just in time. These miracles remind us that God was present even amidst the chaos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, a small group of firemen and one civilian survived in a tiny stairwell as one of the towers collapsed around them. The passengers on Flight 93 fought against the terrorists, preventing further destruction. These are just a few examples of the numerous miracles that took place that day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tpBLlbzE2xg" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding God's sovereignty and purpose in the midst of tragedy is crucial for our faith. It reminds us that God is always in control, even when things seem out of control. Moreover, it helps us trust in His wisdom and goodness, even when we cannot fully comprehend His ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we reflect on September 11, let us not only remember the tragedy but also the stories of hope and resilience. Let us be reminded of the countless lives that have been changed for the better since that day. It is possible that many people have turned to Christ and found salvation as a result of what happened. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When faced with difficult circumstances or tragedies in our own lives, may we find comfort in knowing that God is with us. Let us trust in His sovereignty and have faith that He works all things together for good to those who love Him and are called according to His purpose (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/8/Romans-8-28.html"&gt;Romans 8:28&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/God and Evil/War and Disasters"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Does God Truly Love Satan?

&lt;p&gt;The question of whether God loves Satan is a complex and profound one. As Christians, it is important for us to understand the nature of both God and Satan in order to grasp the depth of this issue. The Bible provides us with insights into the character of both God and Satan, allowing us to discern their relationship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Satan: The Embodiment of Evil&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Satan, also known as the devil, is portrayed in the Bible as the enemy of God and humanity. He is described as the evil one (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/6/Matthew-6-13.html"&gt;Matthew 6:13&lt;/a&gt;), the father of lies and a murderer (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/8/John-8-44.html"&gt;John 8:44&lt;/a&gt;), and the accuser of God's people (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Revelation/12/Revelation-12-10.html"&gt;Revelation 12:10&lt;/a&gt;). Additionally, he is characterized as a tempter (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-Thessalonians/3/1-Thessalonians-3-5.html"&gt;1 Thessalonians 3:5&lt;/a&gt;), proud, wicked, and violent (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/14/Isaiah-14-12.html"&gt;Isaiah 14:12-15&lt;/a&gt;), a deceiver (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Acts/13/Acts-13-10.html"&gt;Acts 13:10&lt;/a&gt;), a schemer (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Ephesians/6/Ephesians-6-11.html"&gt;Ephesians 6:11&lt;/a&gt;), and a thief (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/8/Luke-8-12.html"&gt;Luke 8:12&lt;/a&gt;). In essence, Satan embodies everything that is evil and unholy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;God's Nature: Holy and Just&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast to Satan's evil nature, God is holy and just. The Bible teaches us that God cannot love that which is evil and unholy (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/5/Psalm-5-4.html"&gt;Psalm 5:4&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Habakkuk/1/Habakkuk-1-13.html"&gt;Habakkuk 1:13&lt;/a&gt;). His perfect holiness and righteousness are incompatible with sin. Therefore, it is not possible for God to love Satan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Love for Enemies&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus taught us to love our enemies (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/5/Matthew-5-44.html"&gt;Matthew 5:44&lt;/a&gt;), but this command pertains to our relationships with other human beings. We are called to love all people because they are created in the image of God. However, angels, including Satan, were not created in God's image. Consequently, we are never instructed to love or have affection for angels, whether holy or fallen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Nature of Love and Holiness&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9fiz4VPTJGE" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To fully comprehend why God cannot love Satan, we must understand the nature of love and holiness. Love is not just an emotion but a choice to act in the best interest of another. It is rooted in God's character and expressed through His sacrificial love for us (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/3/John-3-16.html"&gt;John 3:16&lt;/a&gt;). Holiness, on the other hand, refers to God's complete separation from sin and evil. God's love and holiness are intertwined, and they work together in perfect harmony.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we were to love Satan, we would be forced to hate God because holiness is the opposite of sin. Satan's very existence stands in opposition to everything that God loves and values. Therefore, it is not possible for us to love Satan without compromising our love for God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;God's Judgment of Satan&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God has already determined that there will be no forgiveness for Satan (Revelation 20). We, as humans, are the objects of God's sacrificial love, as demonstrated through the cross. While redeeming mankind, God simultaneously put Satan "to open shame" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Colossians/2/Colossians-2-15.html"&gt;Colossians 2:15&lt;/a&gt;). This judgment of Satan is an integral part of God's great love for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding why God does not love Satan has significant implications for our faith. It reminds us of the profound difference between good and evil and reinforces our trust in God's justice. Recognizing Satan's true nature helps us guard against his deceitful tactics and remain steadfast in our commitment to follow God. Furthermore, it deepens our appreciation for the sacrificial love that God has shown us through Jesus Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider the following points as you reflect on this topic:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does understanding Satan's true nature impact your perception of evil?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What does it mean for you personally that God loves you despite your own sinful nature?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can knowing that God's love and holiness are inseparable affect your own pursuit of holiness?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we grapple with the question of whether God loves Satan, we must remember that God's love and holiness are intertwined. While God loves us unconditionally, He cannot love that which is evil and unholy. Recognizing Satan's true nature helps us understand the depth of God's love for us and reinforces our commitment to follow Him.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/God and Evil/The Existence of Sin and Evil"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Ultimate Comparison: Hitler vs Saddam - Lessons for Christian Faith</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/hitler-saddam/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-09-02T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-09-02T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-09-02:/hitler-saddam/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;God's Sovereignty over Rulers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Bible, it is clear that God is sovereign over everything, including the rulers of nations. This means that He is ultimately in control of all things, big and small. The Bible tells us that God is in control of the weather (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/148/Psalm-148-8.html"&gt;Psalm 148:8 …&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;God's Sovereignty over Rulers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Bible, it is clear that God is sovereign over everything, including the rulers of nations. This means that He is ultimately in control of all things, big and small. The Bible tells us that God is in control of the weather (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/148/Psalm-148-8.html"&gt;Psalm 148:8&lt;/a&gt;), life and death (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/104/Psalm-104-29.html"&gt;Psalm 104:29-30&lt;/a&gt;), and even seemingly inconsequential happenings (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Proverbs/16/Proverbs-16-33.html"&gt;Proverbs 16:33&lt;/a&gt;). His sovereignty extends to the rulers of nations as well. The book of Daniel tells us that God sets up kings and deposes them, and He has the power to change times and seasons (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Daniel/2/Daniel-2-20.html"&gt;Daniel 2:20-21&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One example of God's sovereignty over rulers is seen in the life of Cyrus the Great. God called Cyrus by name and promised to set him on the throne of Persia one hundred and fifty years before his birth (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/45/Isaiah-45-13.html"&gt;Isaiah 45:13&lt;/a&gt;). This shows that God had a plan for Cyrus, a pagan ruler, and used him for His purposes. The book of Romans also affirms God's sovereignty over rulers, stating that there is no authority except that which God has established (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/13/Romans-13-1.html"&gt;Romans 13:1&lt;/a&gt;). This statement was written during the time of Nero, a wicked ruler who persecuted Christians. Despite Nero's evil actions, Paul did not question why God allowed him to be in power. Instead, he recognized that all authorities are established by God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding God's sovereignty over rulers helps us to trust in His plan even when we see evil leaders in positions of authority. It reminds us that nothing happens without God's knowledge and permission. It also encourages us to pray for our leaders, knowing that ultimately their actions are subject to God's control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If God is sovereign over rulers, how does this impact our responsibility as citizens? How should we respond when we disagree with the actions of our leaders? How can we pray for our rulers in light of God's sovereignty?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;God's Purpose in Allowing Evil Rulers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it may be difficult to understand why God allows evil rulers to come into power, the Bible provides some insights into His purposes. At times, God has used evil rulers to bring judgment on His people and to bring them back to righteousness. For example, God raised up Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon to punish Judah for their idolatry (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/2-Kings/20/2-Kings-20-17.html"&gt;2 Kings 20:17-18&lt;/a&gt;). However, it is important to note that all rulers are accountable to God for their actions. Babylon, for instance, was later judged for its own wickedness (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/13/Isaiah-13-19.html"&gt;Isaiah 13:19&lt;/a&gt;; 14:4), and Nebuchadnezzar himself faced individual judgment (Daniel 4).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assyria is another example of a nation that God allowed to rise for a purpose but later judged for its pride and cruelty (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/10/Isaiah-10-5.html"&gt;Isaiah 10:5-19&lt;/a&gt;). These examples remind us that while God may use evil rulers for His purposes, there will be a day of reckoning for their actions. Human rulers are not omnipotent or eternal, and they are not immune from punishment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding God's purpose in allowing evil rulers helps us to trust that He has a greater plan beyond our understanding. It also reminds us that no ruler is beyond the reach of God's justice and judgment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z9Ibc_1Hm_U" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Think About It:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How does knowing that God will hold rulers accountable impact our perspective on justice in this world? How can we find hope and comfort in the knowledge that there will be a day of reckoning for those who have abused their power?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Role of Evil Rulers in the Expansion of the Church&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some instances, evil rulers have inadvertently played a role in the growth and spread of the church. The early church faced persecution from governing authorities, which led to the scattering of believers and the spread of the gospel. Acts 8 recounts how a persecution against the early church in Jerusalem resulted in believers being scattered throughout Judea and Samaria (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Acts/8/Acts-8-1.html"&gt;Acts 8:1&lt;/a&gt;). This dispersion contributed to the fulfillment of the Great Commission and the growth of the church.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While persecution is never God's desired plan for His people, He can use difficult circumstances and evil rulers to accomplish His purposes. The example of the early church reminds us that even in the face of opposition, God can bring about good and advance His kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding how God can work through difficult circumstances and evil rulers encourages us to trust His plan even in times of persecution. It reminds us that God can bring beauty out of brokenness and use even the darkest situations for His glory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How does knowing that God can use evil rulers for His purposes impact our response to persecution? How can we find hope and encouragement in the knowledge that God is still at work even in the midst of difficult circumstances?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Accountability of Evil Rulers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although God allows evil rulers to come into power, they are not exempt from accountability. The Bible teaches that all rulers will be held responsible for their actions. Ultimately, those who die in their sins will face eternal punishment in hell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is worth noting that eternity in hell is not limited to specific individuals like Hitler or Saddam Hussein. Rather, it is a fate that awaits all who reject Christ and abuse the people of God. While we may not fully comprehend why God allows evil rulers to exist or why they are not immediately judged, we can trust that there will be a day when justice will be served.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the accountability of evil rulers reminds us that no one is above God's judgment. It also reinforces the importance of our own personal accountability before God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How does the accountability of evil rulers affect our own understanding of justice? How can we find comfort and hope in the knowledge that God will ultimately bring justice to all?&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/God and Evil/War and Disasters"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Unveiling God's Sovereignty: Why He Created Doomed People</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/god-create-doomed-people/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-08-29T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-08-29T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-08-29:/god-create-doomed-people/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;God's Love and Human Choice: Understanding Salvation&lt;/h2&gt;

However, there is a common misconception that God creates people who are doomed to hell.

&lt;p&gt;Salvation is a central concept in the Christian faith. It is the deliverance of humanity from sin and eternal separation from God. However, there is a common misconception that God creates people who are doomed to hell. This article seeks to clarify this misunderstanding and shed light on the role of human choice in salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1. The Wrath of God&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the book of Romans, we see the progression of those who reject Christ. The wrath of God is revealed against the unrighteous because they choose to reject the Creator and worship created things (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/1/Romans-1-18.html"&gt;Romans 1:18&lt;/a&gt;–20). People exchange the glory of God for created things, leading to a downward spiral of sin (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/1/Romans-1-23.html"&gt;Romans 1:23&lt;/a&gt;–25). This spiral is characterized by various sins that all of us can relate to (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/1/Romans-1-28.html"&gt;Romans 1:28&lt;/a&gt;–31). Furthermore, not only do people participate in these sins, but they also approve of those who do them (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/1/Romans-1-32.html"&gt;Romans 1:32&lt;/a&gt;). In the end, everyone stands condemned before God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Understanding the consequences of rejecting God's authority helps us recognize the need for salvation and motivates us to seek a relationship with Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; Reflect on your own life and consider areas where you may have exchanged the glory of God for worldly pursuits. How can you redirect your focus back to Him?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2. The Conviction of Conscience&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God has given every person a conscience that convicts them of their sin (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/2/Romans-2-14.html"&gt;Romans 2:14&lt;/a&gt;–15). Our conscience serves as an internal moral compass, revealing right from wrong. It reminds us that there is a higher standard and that we fall short of it. Therefore, no one has an excuse for their actions or their rejection of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Recognizing our conscience as a gift from God helps us understand the universal moral law He has placed within us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; Reflect on times when your conscience has convicted you of your actions. How does this point to the existence and authority of God?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;3. The Choice to Believe&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus Christ came into the world so that we may believe in Him and have eternal life (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/20/John-20-31.html"&gt;John 20:31&lt;/a&gt;). Through His life, death, and resurrection, Jesus paid the price for our sins and made a way for us to be reconciled with God. However, it is our responsibility to make the choice to believe in Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God allows people to be born so that they have the opportunity to place their faith in the Lord. He desires all people to come to repentance and experience salvation (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/2-Peter/3/2-Peter-3-9.html"&gt;2 Peter 3:9&lt;/a&gt;). It is important to note that God does not force anyone to go to hell. Instead, individuals choose to reject Christ and separate themselves from God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Recognizing that salvation is a choice helps us understand the personal nature of our relationship with God and the responsibility we have in responding to His grace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; Reflect on your own journey of faith. How did you come to the realization that you needed a Savior? Take a moment to express gratitude for God's grace in your life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;4. The Nature of God&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding why some people reject God while others choose to believe can be difficult. However, we can trust in the nature and character of God. He is sovereign and merciful, and His ways are perfect, even when we don't fully understand them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We must remember that God's desire is for all people to be saved (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-Timothy/2/1-Timothy-2-4.html"&gt;1 Timothy 2:4&lt;/a&gt;). He has provided ample evidence of His existence through creation and has revealed Himself through Jesus Christ. Ultimately, it is up to each individual to respond to this evidence and make a choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Trusting in God's nature and character allows us to find peace and reassurance even in the midst of unanswered questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; Consider areas of your life where you struggle to understand God's ways. How can you choose to trust Him despite not having all the answers?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;5. Salvation and Opportunity&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God's love is evident in the fact that He gives every person the opportunity to believe and be saved. He wants everyone to come to a knowledge of the truth (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-Timothy/2/1-Timothy-2-4.html"&gt;1 Timothy 2:4&lt;/a&gt;). If God did not give people the chance to place their faith in Him, He would not be a just and loving God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gJJWAIHKKDo" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Salvation is a gift from God that we receive through faith (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Ephesians/2/Ephesians-2-8.html"&gt;Ephesians 2:8-9&lt;/a&gt;). It is not something we can earn or achieve on our own merit. Rather, it is a result of God's grace and our response to His invitation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Recognizing salvation as a gift reminds us of the incredible love and mercy of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; How does understanding salvation as a gift impact your perspective on your relationship with God? How does it change the way you approach sharing the message of salvation with others?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;6. The Role of Faith&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Faith plays a crucial role in our relationship with God and our experience of salvation. Believing in Jesus Christ as the Son of God and accepting Him as our Lord and Savior is the key to receiving eternal life (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/3/John-3-16.html"&gt;John 3:16&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Faith involves trust and reliance on God. It is through faith that we are justified before God and experience the transformation of our lives. Faith is not simply an intellectual agreement with certain truths; it is a personal commitment to follow Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Understanding the role of faith helps us grasp the personal nature of our relationship with God and the transformative power it can have in our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; Reflect on your own faith journey. How has your faith in Jesus Christ impacted your life? In what ways has it brought you closer to God?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;7. The Unfathomable Love of God&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God's love for humanity is beyond comprehension. Despite our sin and rebellion, He offers us the opportunity to be reconciled with Him through faith in Jesus Christ. This act of sacrificial love demonstrates the depths of God's mercy and grace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Salvation is not something we deserve or earn. It is a gift that God freely offers to all who believe in His Son. This gift is a testament to the boundless love of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Recognizing the unfathomable love of God helps us respond with gratitude and worship, deepening our relationship with Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; Take a moment to reflect on the incredible love that God has shown you through the gift of salvation. How does this love inspire you to live for Him?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God does not create people who are doomed to hell. Rather, He gives every person the opportunity to believe and be saved. Salvation is a personal choice, and God's desire is for everyone to come to repentance and experience eternal life. Understanding the nature of God, the conviction of conscience, and the role of faith helps us grasp the depth of His love and our responsibility in responding to it. Let us continually seek a relationship with Him, sharing the message of salvation with others, and living a life that honors Him.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/God and Evil/The Existence of Sin and Evil"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Is God Cruel?

&lt;p&gt;There are some who argue that the God presented in the Bible is cruel. They point to certain passages that they claim demonstrate God's cruelty. However, it is important to approach this question with an understanding of God's character and His ways. While we may not always …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Is God Cruel?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some who argue that the God presented in the Bible is cruel. They point to certain passages that they claim demonstrate God's cruelty. However, it is important to approach this question with an understanding of God's character and His ways. While we may not always comprehend His actions, we can trust in His goodness and love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;God's Actions and Human Understanding&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those who claim that God is cruel have a significant burden of proof. They are not only claiming to know about the actions of God, but also the circumstances in which He performed those actions and His motivations. Furthermore, they are asserting that they know the mind of God, attributing to Him attitudes of indifference and sadistic pleasure necessary to define Him as cruel. This is beyond human capability—we cannot truly know the mind of God. As the prophet Isaiah wrote, "For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/55/Isaiah-55-8.html"&gt;Isaiah 55:8-9&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it is true that God allows and sometimes causes pain and suffering, we cannot impugn His goodness based on our limited understanding. Rather than assuming cruelty, we should seek to understand the reasons behind His actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Just Punishment or Cruelty?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to consider whether a punishment can be considered cruel if it is just. When God brings punishment upon people, His love is not diminished. In fact, He may be punishing an evil group of people in order to spare those who are devoted to Him. Allowing evil and wrongdoing to go unpunished would be cruel and demonstrate a callousness towards the innocent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, when God caused the Red Sea to close, drowning Pharaoh's army, He was punishing Pharaoh's rebellion against Him while preserving His chosen people from certain slaughter (Exodus 14). Similarly, when God commanded the Israelites to completely destroy their enemies, including women and children, He knew that letting them live would perpetuate future generations devoted to evil practices, including child sacrifices (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Deuteronomy/20/Deuteronomy-20-16.html"&gt;Deuteronomy 20:16-18&lt;/a&gt;). In these instances, God's actions may appear cruel to us, but they are rooted in justice and the preservation of what is good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Pain and Suffering for a Greater Good&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes pain and suffering are necessary to bring about a greater good. Trials and difficulties can produce stronger, better Christians. The Apostle Paul saw his own suffering as a means to keep him reliant on God's power rather than his own (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/2-Corinthians/1/2-Corinthians-1-8.html"&gt;2 Corinthians 1:8-10&lt;/a&gt;; 4:7-12).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God's justice is also vindicated when pain and suffering befall those who deserve it. God demonstrates His mercy by warning individuals repeatedly of the consequences of sin. When people bring calamity upon themselves through their rebellion, it is just punishment, not cruelty. God's patience in allowing rebels to continue shaking their fists at Him indicates His mercy and not cruelty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;God's Glory in All His Attributes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gDCCzzwy_Nk" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;God is glorified when all His attributes are exhibited, including His wrath and anger. While we often appreciate the display of His love and mercy, even the exhibition of His wrath brings Him glory. Ultimately, our goal should be to bring glory to God rather than ourselves. Our finite understanding cannot fully grasp the magnitude of His attributes or question them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Understanding the Book of Job&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book of Job is often cited as evidence of God's sadistic actions against an innocent man. However, a superficial understanding of the book fails to grasp its true message. In the cultural context of the time, people believed that God always blessed the righteous and brought suffering on the unrighteous. The book of Job challenges this theology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Job's suffering highlights that God is not limited to using suffering as a means of retribution. He also uses it to draw people away from earthly temptations. Additionally, Job brings us closer to understanding God's work of atonement on the cross. If we continued to believe that God couldn't allow an innocent man to suffer, we would miss out on God's plan for redemption. The suffering of Jesus Christ demonstrates God's willingness to endure suffering for the sake of bringing salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the nature of God and His actions is crucial for our faith. It enables us to trust in Him even when we don't fully comprehend His ways. Recognizing that God's actions are motivated by His holy and perfect character helps us navigate the challenges of life and draw closer to Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does our limited understanding affect our perception of God's actions?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can punishment be considered just even if it appears cruel to us?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does pain and suffering contribute to our growth and development as Christians?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In what ways can we bring glory to God even in times of suffering?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What can we learn from the book of Job about God's character and His plan for redemption?&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Christians, we may often find ourselves questioning why it seems like good things happen to bad people. This dilemma has troubled believers throughout history, and it reflects the age-old question of why God allows injustice in the world. In Psalm 73, the psalmist Asaph grapples with this very issue. He observes the prosperity and seeming lack of struggles of the wicked and begins to question the fairness of it all. Asaph's struggle resonates with us today, as we may also witness ungodly individuals experiencing success and abundance while we face difficulties in our own lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1. The Envy of the Prosperous Wicked&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asaph, a dedicated servant of God, envied the wicked due to their apparent prosperity and freedom from troubles. He saw them enjoying wealth, health, and material possessions while he struggled to make ends meet. This led him to question why God would allow such injustice to occur. It is a common experience for believers to feel disheartened when they see ungodly individuals seemingly thriving while they face hardships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2. Seeking Understanding in God's Presence&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his distress, Asaph sought understanding by entering into the sanctuary of God. It was in His presence that he gained insight into the true destiny of the wicked. Asaph realized that their prosperity was temporary and illusory. Although they may have earthly riches, they lacked the true riches of eternal life in God. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we feel envious or discouraged by the success of ungodly individuals, we must remember that their prosperity is fleeting. True fulfillment and everlasting joy can only be found in a relationship with God through Jesus Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Think About It:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider the times when you have compared your life to that of others who seem to be prospering despite their ungodliness. How does knowing that their prosperity is temporary change your perspective?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;3. The Deception of Earthly Prosperity&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asaph came to understand that the wicked's prosperity was a deception orchestrated by Satan, the ancient deceiver. He had used lies to distract Asaph from the reality of God and to make him question the fairness of his own circumstances. The temporary fulfillment provided by earthly prosperity is comparable to a pleasant dream that fades upon waking. Asaph rebuked himself for being senseless and ignorant in his envy, realizing that true joy and spiritual prosperity are found in a relationship with God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;4. The Ultimate Destiny of the Wicked&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Entering into God's presence allowed Asaph to grasp the final destiny of the wicked. He understood that those who reject God and choose a life of ungodliness are on slippery ground, destined for ruin. The seeming prosperity they enjoy in this life will be abruptly shattered, and they will face destruction and terror. In contrast, those who remain faithful to God will find refuge in Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the ultimate destiny of the wicked helps us to see beyond their temporary success and recognize the eternal consequences of their choices. It reminds us of the importance of staying faithful to God, even when we face hardships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Think About It:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reflect on the choices you have witnessed ungodly individuals making and consider how those choices may impact their eternal destiny. How does this knowledge affect your perspective on their temporary successes?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IKOeL8OxGzo" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;5. Finding Contentment in God's Presence&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asaph's journey into God's presence brought him back to a place of contentment and joy in God alone. He realized that nothing on earth could compare to having a relationship with God. Earthly desires and pursuits pale in comparison to the fulfillment found in knowing and serving our Creator. Asaph declared that it is good to be near God and made Him his refuge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;6. The Narrow Road to Eternal Life&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Christians, we may not always have everything we desire in this world. However, our hope lies in the eternal life promised through Jesus Christ. When we are tempted to envy the temporary prosperity of the wicked, we must remember that their path leads to destruction. Instead, we should focus on the narrow road that leads to eternal life with God. This perspective should bring us joy and comfort, knowing that true riches and everlasting fulfillment are found in Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the narrow road that leads to eternal life reminds us to prioritize our relationship with God over earthly desires. It encourages us to persevere in faith, even when faced with the seeming successes of those who reject God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Think About It:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider the ways in which you prioritize your relationship with God in your daily life. How can you strengthen your commitment to the narrow road that leads to eternal life?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dilemma of good things happening to bad people has troubled believers throughout history. Asaph's experience in Psalm 73 provides valuable insights into this issue. When we witness ungodly individuals seemingly prospering while we face difficulties, we need to seek understanding in God's presence. By entering into His sanctuary, we gain perspective on the temporary nature of earthly prosperity and the ultimate destiny of the wicked. We find contentment and joy in knowing and serving God, recognizing that true fulfillment is found in Him alone. Our focus should remain on the narrow road that leads to eternal life through Jesus Christ, rather than being envious of temporary worldly success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Christians, it is important for us to remember that our ultimate goal is not earthly prosperity, but a relationship with God and eternal life. By keeping our focus on Him and seeking His wisdom and understanding, we can find contentment and peace even in the face of the seeming success of the wicked. Rather than being discouraged or envious, let us trust in God's plan and continue to walk faithfully on the narrow road that leads to eternal life.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/God and Evil/Hardships"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Is God Selfish? Unveiling the Divine Compassion in Christianity</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/is-god-selfish/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-08-11T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-08-11T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-08-11:/is-god-selfish/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Is God Selfish?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We often hear the question of whether God is selfish or egotistical. While the Bible does not directly address this question, it is important to examine it from a biblical perspective.

&lt;p&gt;We often hear the question of whether God is selfish or egotistical. While the Bible does not directly address this question, it is important to examine it from a biblical perspective. Accusations of God's selfishness often arise from individuals who do not believe in God or who use it as an argument against the goodness of God as presented in the Bible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;God's Perfect Being&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God is the only perfect being in the entire universe, and any attention, praise, and adoration directed towards Him is completely warranted. Accusing God of selfishness stems from our own desire to occupy the place that rightfully belongs to God. It is our own selfishness that allows us to accuse God of selfishness. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;God's Self-Sufficiency&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God was completely self-sufficient and had no need to create other beings in order to find fulfillment. Within the Trinity, there existed perfect love and fellowship. The only reason God created human beings is so that we may also experience His love and perfection. Comparing God's alleged selfishness to that of a child accusing his parents of being selfish because they refuse to buy him all the toys he wants helps put things into perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/I2aAy6-w2HU" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Glorifying God and Enjoying Him Forever&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Westminster Catechism summarizes humanity’s purpose as "to glorify God and enjoy Him forever." By submitting to and glorifying God, we also benefit immeasurably and find the purpose for which we were created. It may seem more generous if God gave people happiness whether or not they wanted a relationship with Him, but C.S. Lewis explains that true happiness can only be found in a relationship with God. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Our Rebellion Against God&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By nature, we do not want to submit to God and often seek to banish Him from our lives so that we can maintain control and be gods unto ourselves. Despite our rebellion, God demonstrated His love for us by sending Jesus Christ to die for our sins. It is through God's selflessness that we are able to receive forgiveness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding whether God is selfish or not is crucial as it shapes our perception of His character and actions. Accusing God of selfishness can lead to a distorted view of who He truly is. Recognizing God's self-sufficiency and perfect being helps us realize that any attention directed towards Him is warranted. Additionally, grasping the purpose of glorifying God and enjoying Him forever enables us to find true fulfillment in life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Think About It&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reflect on your own desires and motivations. Are there areas where you may be projecting your own selfishness onto God?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consider the concept of finding true happiness in a relationship with God. How does this challenge your understanding of happiness?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In what ways can you actively submit to and glorify God in your daily life? How might this impact your overall perspective and sense of fulfillment?&lt;/li&gt;

Understanding Divine Healing</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/god-allow-sickness/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-08-06T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-08-06T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-08-06:/god-allow-sickness/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;God's Purpose in Allowing Sickness&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we experience sickness or suffering, it can be challenging to understand why God allows it. However, as Christians, we believe that God's ways are higher than our ways (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/55/Isaiah-55-9.html"&gt;Isaiah 55:9&lt;/a&gt;) and that He can bring about good from any situation (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/8/Romans-8-28.html"&gt;Romans 8:28 …&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;God's Purpose in Allowing Sickness&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we experience sickness or suffering, it can be challenging to understand why God allows it. However, as Christians, we believe that God's ways are higher than our ways (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/55/Isaiah-55-9.html"&gt;Isaiah 55:9&lt;/a&gt;) and that He can bring about good from any situation (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/8/Romans-8-28.html"&gt;Romans 8:28&lt;/a&gt;). While sickness is not always directly from God, He sometimes allows or even causes it to accomplish His sovereign purposes. It is important to remember that even in times of sickness, God is still in control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Sickness in a Fallen World&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a world tainted by sin, sickness, disease, and death will always be present. As fallen beings with physical bodies prone to disease and illness, we are susceptible to sickness as a result of the natural course of things in this world. Some sickness may also be the result of a demonic attack, as described in the Bible (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/17/Matthew-17-14.html"&gt;Matthew 17:14-18&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/13/Luke-13-10.html"&gt;Luke 13:10-16&lt;/a&gt;). Even in these instances, God remains in control and can still use sickness according to His perfect will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Sickness as Discipline and Spiritual Growth&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/12/Hebrews-12-5.html"&gt;Hebrews 12:5-11&lt;/a&gt; describes how God disciplines us to produce a harvest of righteousness. While sickness is not directly addressed in this passage, it teaches us that discipline can be a means through which God works for our spiritual growth. It may be difficult for us to comprehend why God would use sickness in this manner, but as believers in His sovereignty, we understand that suffering is something He allows and/or causes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The psalmist in Psalm 119 provides us with an example of looking at suffering from God's perspective. As the psalmist reflects on his own afflictions, he acknowledges that it was good for him to be afflicted so that he might learn God's decrees and obey His Word. The psalmist recognizes that it was through his suffering that God's faithfulness was revealed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;God's Sovereignty in Sickness&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding and accepting God's sovereignty in sickness can be a challenging concept. While we may not fully grasp why God allows sickness, we can trust that He is working all things for our ultimate good and His glory. Even the ultimate suffering—death—can be seen as an act of God's goodness, as it grants believers eternal life in heaven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Ministering to Those Suffering&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MGMRuIVGSNc" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When people are suffering, it is important for us as Christians to minister to them, care for them, pray for them, and offer comfort. In the midst of suffering, it may not always be appropriate to emphasize the idea that God will bring good out of the suffering. While this truth is valid, those who are suffering need our love and encouragement more than theological reminders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding why God allows sickness is crucial in our walk of faith. It helps us navigate the challenges and uncertainties that come with illness and suffering. Recognizing that sickness can serve a purpose in God's greater plan can bring comfort and hope during difficult times. It also reminds us of our need to trust in God's sovereignty and lean on Him for strength and guidance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Think About It&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does knowing that sickness is a result of living in a fallen world affect your perspective on illness?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reflect on a time when you or someone you know experienced sickness or suffering. In what ways did it lead to spiritual growth or draw you closer to God?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can you minister to those who are suffering without overwhelming them with theological explanations?&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question of whether God knew that Satan would rebel is an important one. According to the Bible, God is described as being omniscient, meaning that He is all-knowing. This concept is supported by various passages in Scripture such as &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Job/37/Job-37-16.html"&gt;Job 37:16&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/139/Psalm-139-2.html"&gt;Psalm …&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Did God Know Satan Would Rebel?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question of whether God knew that Satan would rebel is an important one. According to the Bible, God is described as being omniscient, meaning that He is all-knowing. This concept is supported by various passages in Scripture such as &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Job/37/Job-37-16.html"&gt;Job 37:16&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/139/Psalm-139-2.html"&gt;Psalm 139:2&lt;/a&gt;–4 and 147:5, &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Proverbs/5/Proverbs-5-21.html"&gt;Proverbs 5:21&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/46/Isaiah-46-9.html"&gt;Isaiah 46:9-10&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-John/3/1-John-3-19.html"&gt;1 John 3:19&lt;/a&gt;–20. These verses leave no doubt that God's knowledge is infinite, and He knows everything that has happened in the past, is happening now, and will happen in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we look at some of the superlatives used in these verses such as "perfect in knowledge," "his understanding has no limit," and "he knows everything," it becomes clear that God's knowledge is not just greater than our own, but infinitely greater. He knows all things completely. If God's knowledge were not perfect, there would be a deficiency in His nature. However, any deficiency in God's nature would mean that He cannot be God because His essence requires the perfection of all His attributes. Therefore, the answer to the first question is "yes, God knew that Satan would rebel."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why Did God Create Satan Knowing He Would Rebel?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second part of the question, "Why did God create Satan knowing ahead of time he was going to rebel?" is a bit trickier because the Bible does not always provide comprehensive answers to "why" questions. However, we can still gain some limited understanding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To begin with, it is important to note that saying "Satan would rebel" is not the same as saying "Satan rebelled." The angel Lucifer had free will and made his own choices. God did not create Lucifer as the devil; He created him good (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/1/Genesis-1-31.html"&gt;Genesis 1:31&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In trying to understand why God created Satan, knowing he would rebel, we should consider a few important facts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Lucifer's Original Purpose&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lucifer had a good and perfect purpose before his fall. His rebellion does not change God's original intent from something good to something bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;God's Sovereignty&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God's sovereignty extends to Satan, even in his fallen condition. This means that God is able to use Satan's evil actions to ultimately bring about God's holy plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;God's Plan of Salvation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God's plan of salvation was ordained from eternity past. Salvation requires something to be saved from, so God allowed Satan's rebellion and the spread of sin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Role of Suffering&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gaS59ddVkao" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The suffering that Satan brought into the world actually became the means by which Jesus, in His humanity, was made the complete and perfect Savior of mankind. Through His suffering, Jesus brings many sons and daughters to glory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Destruction of Satan's Work&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the very beginning, God's plan in Christ included the destruction of Satan's work. This is mentioned in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-John/3/1-John-3-8.html"&gt;1 John 3:8&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, we cannot fully understand why God created Satan, knowing he would rebel. It may be tempting to assume that things would be "better" if Satan had never been created or to declare that God should have done things differently. However, such assumptions and declarations are unwise. In fact, claiming that we know better than God how to run the universe is falling into the same sin as the devil himself when he tried to exalt himself above the Most High (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/14/Isaiah-14-13.html"&gt;Isaiah 14:13&lt;/a&gt;–14).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding why God created Satan, knowing he would rebel, is significant for several reasons. Firstly, it highlights the sovereignty and omniscience of God. It reminds us that He is in control of all things, even the actions of rebellious beings. Secondly, it emphasizes the importance of free will. Lucifer had the ability to make his own choices, and his rebellion serves as a reminder that even creatures created good can choose to reject God. Finally, it points to the ultimate victory of Christ over Satan and sin. God's plan of redemption and salvation is not thwarted by rebellion, but rather accomplished through it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Think About It&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reflecting on the fact that God knew Satan would rebel, yet still created him, raises several thought-provoking questions. It challenges us to consider our own understanding of God's sovereignty and His purposes in allowing evil to exist. It also invites us to reflect on our own choices and the consequences they have in light of God's omniscience. Ultimately, it should lead us to a place of humility and trust in God's perfect wisdom and plan for our lives.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/God and Evil/The Existence of Sin and Evil"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Unveiling the Almighty: Exploring the God of the Old Testament</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/god-of-the-old-testament/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-07-27T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-07-27T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-07-27:/god-of-the-old-testament/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;The God of the Old Testament&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The God of the Old Testament is often criticized for being portrayed as immoral and evil. However, it is important to approach these critiques with a fair understanding of the biblical context and historical background. Let's address some key points that shed light on this topic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;God's Warnings and Judgments&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One common criticism is that God's judgments involved the killing of certain people. However, a closer examination reveals a pattern in how God arrives at His declarations of judgment:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;God warns of a coming judgment to remove moral corruption from His creation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Individual judgments are handed down for extreme acts of evil.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Each judgment is preceded by warnings and often long periods of time for people to repent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The presence of "good" or "innocent" people in a situation can delay or stop judgment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A way of escape is usually provided, and those who disregard it receive judgment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Redemption from the culture receiving judgment is possible for individuals or groups.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we were to witness the evil actions judged by God in the Old Testament today, we would likely call for immediate action to stop such atrocities. Therefore, it is not fair to criticize God for carrying out severe judgments on national evil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Understanding God's warnings and judgments helps us see His desire for justice and righteousness in the world. It also reminds us that God's actions are not arbitrary but are based on principles of morality and His ultimate plan for humanity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; How does considering the context and purpose behind God's judgments influence your understanding of His character?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Misconceptions about God&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several misconceptions about God's character in the Old Testament that need clarification:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is God misogynistic? The Bible affirms that women are equal to men in nature, value of life, redemptive status, spiritual gifting, political leadership, and business leadership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is God infanticidal? No, God declares love and protection for children, including the unborn. Children only experienced judgments from God when their parents resisted calls for repentance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is God filicidal? The story of Abraham being asked to sacrifice his son Isaac is often misunderstood. God allowed this episode to foreshadow the future sacrifice of His own Son and knew that Isaac would not die.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is God homophobic? No, God offers His grace and redemption to everyone, including homosexuals. The Bible addresses certain sexual behaviors as sinful but also provides a path to forgiveness and transformation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is God racist? No, God is the Creator of all and made all people in His image. The judgments carried out in response to people's sin were not racially motivated, as Israel itself was held accountable in the same way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Clarifying these misconceptions helps us understand the true character of God and His love for all people, regardless of gender, age, or background.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CUYX2nkRD2I" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; How do these clarifications challenge or affirm your previous understanding of God's character?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;God's Mercy and Love&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God's mercy and love were well-known in Old Testament times. Despite the portrayal of judgment, there are numerous instances where God shows mercy and offers redemption:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The word "mercy" is used four times more often in the Old Testament than in the New Testament.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The prophet Jonah knew of God's mercy but resisted delivering a warning to Nineveh because he did not want them to be saved.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;God is described as gracious, compassionate, slow to anger, abounding in love, and willing to relent from sending calamity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding God's mercy helps us see that He desires repentance and restoration rather than immediate judgment. It also reveals His willingness to extend grace even to those who have sinned greatly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Recognizing God's mercy and love in the Old Testament helps us appreciate His desire for reconciliation and highlights the continuity of His character throughout Scripture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; How does the concept of God's mercy in the Old Testament impact your understanding of His relationship with humanity?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, the caricature of God presented by critics is far from an accurate portrayal of the God of the Old Testament. By examining the biblical context and historical background, we can see that God's actions are rooted in justice, righteousness, and a desire for repentance and redemption. Clarifying misconceptions about God's character further reveals His love, equality, and willingness to extend mercy. Understanding these aspects deepens our understanding of God's nature and His relationship with humanity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suffering is a universal experience that affects all people to some degree.

&lt;p&gt;Suffering is a universal experience that affects all people to some degree. While some suffering may be a consequence of personal choices or sinful actions, there are instances where innocent individuals endure hardship. This raises the question: why would God allow innocent people to suffer? In addressing this issue, it is important to understand that suffering does not necessarily equate to personal sin or guilt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Misconception of Sin and Suffering&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is natural for humans to seek a connection between bad behavior and negative circumstances, as well as between good behavior and blessings. However, Jesus confronted this misconception on multiple occasions. In one instance, His disciples asked whether a man born blind had sinned or if his parents were to blame. Jesus corrected their thinking, stating that neither the man nor his parents sinned. Instead, Jesus explained that the man's blindness was an opportunity for God's works to be displayed (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/9/John-9-1.html"&gt;John 9:1&lt;/a&gt;–3).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In another incident, Jesus addressed the deaths of individuals who were killed in an accident when a tower fell on them. He dismissed the idea that these individuals were more guilty than others living in Jerusalem. Jesus emphasized that tragedy and suffering are not necessarily the result of personal sin. However, He also highlighted the reality of living in a fallen world where sin and its effects are present (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/13/Luke-13-4.html"&gt;Luke 13:4&lt;/a&gt;–5).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Concept of Innocence&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The notion of innocence becomes a complex matter when considering biblical teachings. According to Scripture, "all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/3/Romans-3-23.html"&gt;Romans 3:23&lt;/a&gt;). Therefore, from a biblical perspective, no one is truly "innocent" in the sense of being sinless. Due to humanity's fallen nature inherited from Adam, all individuals are born with a sinful inclination (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/5/Romans-5-12.html"&gt;Romans 5:12&lt;/a&gt;). Consequently, suffering is an inevitable consequence of living in a fallen world where sin's effects permeate everything (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/8/Romans-8-22.html"&gt;Romans 8:22&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most heartbreaking instances of suffering is when it affects children. Children represent a close approximation to innocence in this world, and their suffering is truly tragic. Sometimes, innocent children suffer as a result of the sins of others, such as neglect, abuse, or drunk driving. In these cases, the suffering is directly linked to personal sin, albeit not committed by the child. It serves as a reminder that our actions can have profound effects on those around us. Other times, innocent children suffer due to what may be considered "acts of God," such as natural disasters, accidents, or childhood cancer. Even in these cases, suffering can be attributed to sin in a general sense because we live in a fallen world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Redemption and Purpose of Suffering&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zeaZhbuPjnM" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it may seem that innocent suffering is without purpose, God does not leave us to suffer aimlessly. He has a perfect plan to redeem and utilize suffering for His threefold purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Drawing Us Closer to Him&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pain and suffering serve as catalysts that draw us closer to God. Jesus Himself declared, "In this world you will have trouble" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/16/John-16-33.html"&gt;John 16:33&lt;/a&gt;). Trials and distress are not unusual; they are an inherent part of life in a fallen world. In times of despair and sorrow, we naturally reach out to God for comfort and strength. As His children, we find that He is always there to comfort and uphold us through every trial. This experience solidifies our faith in His faithfulness and ensures our continual reliance on Him. Moreover, as we experience God's comfort during our own trials, we are then able to extend that same comfort to others who are suffering (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/2-Corinthians/1/2-Corinthians-1-4.html"&gt;2 Corinthians 1:4&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Understanding that suffering can draw us closer to God provides hope and reassurance during difficult times. It reminds us that God is present even in the midst of our suffering and that He can use our pain to strengthen our faith and bring comfort to others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; Reflect on a time when you experienced suffering or witnessed the suffering of someone close to you. How did that experience draw you closer to God or impact your relationship with Him? How were you able to extend comfort to others who were suffering?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Testing and Proving Our Faith&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suffering also serves as a means of testing and proving the genuineness of our faith. How we respond to suffering, especially when we are innocent of any wrongdoing, reveals the authenticity of our faith. Those who have placed their faith in Jesus, the pioneer and perfecter of faith (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/12/Hebrews-12-2.html"&gt;Hebrews 12:2&lt;/a&gt;), will not be crushed by suffering. Instead, they emerge from trials with their faith intact, having been tested by fire. This testing results in praise, glory, and honor when Jesus Christ is revealed (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-Peter/1/1-Peter-1-7.html"&gt;1 Peter 1:7&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genuine faith does not lead individuals to question God's goodness or shake their fists at Him in times of suffering. Instead, it allows them to consider it pure joy because they understand that trials prove their status as children of God (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/James/1/James-1-2.html"&gt;James 1:2&lt;/a&gt;). Those who persevere under trial will receive the crown of life promised by the Lord to those who love Him (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/James/1/James-1-12.html"&gt;James 1:12&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Recognizing that our faith is tested through suffering helps us understand that challenges and hardships are not indications of God's abandonment or punishment. Instead, they provide an opportunity for us to demonstrate the authenticity of our faith and ultimately receive eternal rewards from God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; Reflect on a difficult time in your life when your faith was tested. How did you respond? How did your faith grow stronger as a result? In what ways might your faith be refined through future trials?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Shifting Our Focus to the Eternal Kingdom&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suffering can redirect our gaze from the temporal things of this world to the eternal kingdom of God. The Bible repeatedly exhorts believers not to become entangled in the affairs of this world but to fix their eyes on the world to come. While innocent suffering may impact this present life, it is essential to remember that this world and everything in it will pass away. The kingdom of God, however, is eternal. Jesus affirmed that His kingdom is not of this world (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/18/John-18-36.html"&gt;John 18:36&lt;/a&gt;). Those who follow Him understand that the circumstances of this life, whether good or bad, do not have the final say. Even the most terrible sufferings endured here cannot compare to the glory that will be revealed in us (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/8/Romans-8-18.html"&gt;Romans 8:18&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Recognizing the temporary nature of suffering enables us to maintain an eternal perspective and find hope in God's promises. It reminds us that our ultimate destiny lies beyond this world and that our suffering is not in vain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; Consider how your perspective on suffering might change when you focus on the eternal kingdom of God. How can you cultivate an eternal perspective in your daily life, especially during times of suffering?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;God's Good Purpose in Suffering&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it is within God's power to prevent all suffering, He assures us that "all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/8/Romans-8-28.html"&gt;Romans 8:28&lt;/a&gt;, KJV). This includes innocent suffering, as it forms part of the "all things" that God uses to accomplish His good purposes ultimately. We can trust in God's perfect plan and flawless character, knowing that He will not disappoint those who place their trust in Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, innocent suffering exists in a fallen world where sin's effects are pervasive. However, God can redeem and utilize suffering for His purposes. He uses suffering to draw us closer to Him, test and prove the authenticity of our faith, and shift our focus from the temporary to the eternal. Understanding these truths can provide comfort, strengthen our faith, and help us persevere in the face of suffering.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/God and Evil/Hardships"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Unveiling the Truth: Is God Evil or Just Misunderstood?</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/is-god-evil/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-07-21T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-07-21T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-07-21:/is-god-evil/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Is God Evil?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many people have questioned whether God is evil, and there are various arguments presented to support this claim.

While their …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Is God Evil?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many people have questioned whether God is evil, and there are various arguments presented to support this claim. One website, evilbible.com, attempts to demonstrate that the Bible is not the Word of God and that the God of Christianity is not worthy of worship. While their arguments may seem compelling at first glance, a closer examination reveals that they are based on misunderstandings of God's Word, character, and creation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Misunderstanding of God's Word&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evilbible.com asserts that the Bible is full of atrocities and contradictions, which they use to argue against its divine inspiration. While it is true that the Bible records many terrible things, such as the brutal rape and murder of a woman in Judges 19, it is important to understand that the Bible does not endorse or commend these actions. The Bible simply records historical events, including the sinful actions of humanity. Evilbible.com fails to recognize this distinction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another example they bring up is the command for Abraham to sacrifice his son Isaac. They argue that this proves God is not loving and good. However, they misunderstand the narrative. God never intended for Abraham to actually sacrifice his son; it was a test of faith. The story foreshadows God sacrificing His own Son Jesus for the sins of humanity. Evilbible.com's argument falls apart when one understands the true meaning behind this event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding supposed contradictions in the Bible, evilbible.com lists several examples to suggest that it is not inerrant. However, many of these alleged contradictions have been thoroughly discussed and addressed by biblical scholars. It is important to note that the Bible is a spiritual book with deeper meanings beyond literal interpretation. For example, &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Leviticus/19/Leviticus-19-19.html"&gt;Leviticus 19:19&lt;/a&gt; prohibits mixing different kinds of animals, seeds, and materials. Critics may mock this as a prohibition against wearing wool and polyester blends, but it actually symbolizes Israel's need to remain devoted to God and not assimilate pagan teachings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary, evilbible.com's claims of atrocities and contradictions in the Bible do not hold up under closer scrutiny. The Bible records historical events without endorsing them, and many supposed contradictions can be explained through a deeper understanding of spiritual lessons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Misunderstanding of God's Character&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evilbible.com portrays God as a tyrant and murderer, but this perspective is based on a misunderstanding of history and God's character. They argue that God's judgment on various cultures and peoples was unjust. However, they overlook the historical evidence that these nations practiced wickedness and atrocities. For example, the Assyrians were known for their brutal and cruel acts, such as impaling victims on sharp poles and making handbags from their skins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evilbible.com also claims that God is the creator of evil, citing &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/45/Isaiah-45-7.html"&gt;Isaiah 45:7&lt;/a&gt;. However, this verse has been misunderstood due to a poor translation in the King James Version. The correct interpretation is that God brings calamity and disaster as consequences for those who oppose Him, not moral evil. God is a just and righteous deity who punishes those who persist in wickedness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to recognize that evilbible.com invokes a Christian moral framework to criticize God, which is intellectually inconsistent for atheists. Without a belief in God, there can be no objective basis for morality. Atheists like Richard Dawkins acknowledge this limitation and argue that life has no higher purpose or meaning. Therefore, evilbible.com lacks a moral foundation to make claims about good and evil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, evilbible.com's portrayal of God as a tyrant and creator of evil is based on misunderstandings of history, biblical interpretation, and the foundation of morality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Misunderstanding of God's Creation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evilbible.com borrows from a Christian moral worldview to argue against God, which is irrational and disingenuous. They claim that creation itself refutes the existence of the God described in the Bible. However, they fail to provide an explanation for how an impersonal, amoral, purposeless universe could produce personal beings with a concern for morality and meaning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XBIXPr6AH4A" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The existence of evil is often used as an argument against God, but it can be understood within the framework of free will. Evilbible.com rejects this argument and fails to recognize that moral evil arises from the misuse of freedom. The crucifixion of Jesus, which appeared to be gratuitous evil, ultimately led to redemption for humanity. God's gift of freedom allows for moral choices and their consequences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evilbible.com also argues that God's nature contradicts the world we observe. However, the characteristics of the Judeo-Christian God align with what we can infer from creation itself. He is supernatural, powerful, eternal, omnipresent, timeless, immaterial, personal, necessary, infinite, diverse yet unified, intelligent, purposeful, moral, and caring. This profile matches the God described in the Bible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, evilbible.com's arguments against God's existence based on creation overlook the rationality and consistency of a divine Creator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question of whether God is evil is crucial because it shapes our understanding of who God is and how we relate to Him. Misunderstandings can lead to distorted views of God's character and hinder our ability to experience His love and grace. It is important to approach these questions with open hearts and minds while seeking a deeper understanding of God's Word.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Think About It&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does your perception of God's character influence your relationship with Him?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are there any areas in your understanding of God where you may have misconceptions or misunderstandings?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can a deeper understanding of God's Word help address questions or doubts you may have about His character?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reflect on the moral framework you hold. Where do you believe it originates from, and how does it affect your understanding of good and evil?&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deception is a concept that is deeply intertwined with the spiritual realm. The Bible reveals that Satan, known as the "father of lies," actively deceives those who are in need of accepting the truth (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/8/John-8-44.html"&gt;John 8:44&lt;/a&gt;). At first glance, it may seem perplexing that God …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;God's Allowance of Deception&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deception is a concept that is deeply intertwined with the spiritual realm. The Bible reveals that Satan, known as the "father of lies," actively deceives those who are in need of accepting the truth (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/8/John-8-44.html"&gt;John 8:44&lt;/a&gt;). At first glance, it may seem perplexing that God allows deception to occur when His desire is for all people to repent and be saved (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/2-Peter/3/2-Peter-3-9.html"&gt;2 Peter 3:9&lt;/a&gt;). However, a closer examination of scripture provides insights into the relationship between sin, deception, and humanity's capacity to choose. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Deeper Nature of Deception&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we think of deception, we often view it as being tricked or lied to. However, in a spiritual context, deception goes beyond surface-level manipulation. It involves our choices and what we willingly choose to believe, even when faced with evidence to the contrary (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/16/Luke-16-31.html"&gt;Luke 16:31&lt;/a&gt;). This means that intelligence, philosophical ability, or wisdom are not prerequisites for salvation (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Galatians/3/Galatians-3-28.html"&gt;Galatians 3:28&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-Corinthians/1/1-Corinthians-1-20.html"&gt;1 Corinthians 1:20&lt;/a&gt;, 26). In fact, throughout history, humans have often used knowledge to develop more sophisticated ways to sin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Eve's Fall and Spiritual Deception&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z6NC_kA3NHQ" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To understand the nature of spiritual deception, we can look at the example of Eve in the Garden of Eden. When the serpent asked Eve if God had really said they couldn't eat from a certain tree, Eve responded by quoting God's command but added her own interpretation (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/3/Genesis-3-1.html"&gt;Genesis 3:1-3&lt;/a&gt;). Despite knowing what was right, she chose to entertain the serpent's temptations and desires for personal gain (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/3/Genesis-3-4.html"&gt;Genesis 3:4-6&lt;/a&gt;). Eve was deceived by the serpent's cunningness (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/2-Corinthians/11/2-Corinthians-11-3.html"&gt;2 Corinthians 11:3&lt;/a&gt;), but ultimately, she exercised her free will to make a wrong choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even today, Satan appeals to our natural desires and urges us to fulfill them in ways that dishonor God. Our longing for self-satisfaction makes Satan's deception all the more potent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Rejecting Apparent Truth and Spiritual Deception&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God has made Himself known through various means, including the sending of His Son, the signs of His existence in the world, and His availability to those who seek Him (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/3/John-3-16.html"&gt;John 3:16&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/1/Romans-1-20.html"&gt;Romans 1:20&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Deuteronomy/4/Deuteronomy-4-29.html"&gt;Deuteronomy 4:29&lt;/a&gt;). However, when people reject what is clearly seen of God, it leads to a downward spiral of spiritual deception. This rejection creates a void that will be filled by something less than true. The unbeliever exchanges the truth for a lie, and Satan is ready to offer a wide array of lies to choose from (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/1/Romans-1-25.html"&gt;Romans 1:25&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Resisting God and falling into spiritual deception is a risk that anyone takes when they reject the truth (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/2-Thessalonians/2/2-Thessalonians-2-8.html"&gt;2 Thessalonians 2:8-10&lt;/a&gt;). When we reject spiritual truth, we open ourselves up to believing anything. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Human Choice and Spiritual Deception&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to understand that all human sin is based on individual choice (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-Corinthians/10/1-Corinthians-10-13.html"&gt;1 Corinthians 10:13&lt;/a&gt;). When we reject truth, we make ourselves vulnerable to deception. Repeated rejection of spiritual truth brings about spiritual deception as a divine consequence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eve's sin was not solely due to being overpowered by a demonic force, but rather her choice to listen to the lie presented to her. She allowed her desires for a better life and personal gain to influence her decision-making process. In the same way, our choices are pivotal in determining whether we succumb to spiritual deception or remain rooted in God's truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding why God allows deception provides us with valuable insights into the human condition and our relationship with Him. It highlights the importance of actively seeking and embracing the truth while being aware of the potential for deception. By recognizing our vulnerability to deception, we can guard ourselves against the lies of the enemy and make choices that align with God's will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Think About It&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does understanding the nature of spiritual deception impact your view of personal responsibility in making choices?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In what ways can you actively guard yourself against spiritual deception and ensure that you are rooted in God's truth?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reflect on instances in your life where you may have been deceived by the enemy's lies. How could a deeper understanding of spiritual deception help you avoid similar situations in the future?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;</content><category term="God/God and Evil/The Existence of Sin and Evil"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Unveiling the Divine Truth: Is God a Megalomaniac?</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/god-megalomaniac/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-07-09T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-07-09T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-07-09:/god-megalomaniac/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Is God a Megalomaniac?&lt;/h2&gt;

It involves delusion and causing harm to oneself and others due to an obsession with power or image. However, when it comes to God, the idea of Him …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Is God a Megalomaniac?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Megalomania is a mental disorder where a person has an exaggerated opinion of their own power or abilities. It involves delusion and causing harm to oneself and others due to an obsession with power or image. However, when it comes to God, the idea of Him being a megalomaniac does not hold true. Let's explore why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Point 1: Megalomania involves delusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Megalomania is characterized by the belief in something that is not true. It is when someone thinks they are more important or capable than they actually are. For example, a mediocre chess player who accuses others of cheating when they lose is displaying megalomania. Adolf Hitler's refusal to listen to his generals during World War II due to his overconfidence in his own abilities is another example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast, God is not delusional. His self-assessment is true because He is the only God and possesses absolute power, sovereignty, and knowledge. So, as long as God's claims about Himself are true, He cannot be considered a megalomaniac.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Point 2: Megalomania involves harm&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Megalomania often leads to actions that are irrational, dangerous, or harmful to oneself and others. Hitler's overestimation of his military genius resulted in several disastrous decisions. Movie villains like Darth Vader who kill their subordinates for minor failures also exhibit megalomania.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, God is not capricious or cruel. His actions towards humanity are explicitly intended for our benefit. For example, God's sacrifice of submitting Himself to humiliation and death to forgive our sins is an act of tremendous love and concern. It would be unfair to label such actions as megalomania since they are meant for our ultimate good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding that God is not a megalomaniac is crucial for our faith and relationship with Him. It assures us that His claims about Himself are true, and His actions are motivated by love and concern for us. Recognizing God's true nature allows us to trust in His sovereignty and rely on His guidance in our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Point 3: God's self-assessment is accurate&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A key aspect of megalomania is the inaccuracy of the person's beliefs about themselves. However, when it comes to God, His claims about His attributes are accurate. For example, God claims to be omnipotent (all-powerful) and omniscient (all-knowing). These are not exaggerated claims but true characteristics of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To illustrate this, consider a person who believes they are the tallest in a room and refuses to admit otherwise. If that person is indeed taller than anyone else present, their belief is not megalomania. Similarly, when God claims traits such as omnipotence and omniscience, He is not expressing megalomania because those attributes are true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LLuyGjxpDzU" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How does knowing that God's self-assessment is accurate impact your understanding of His power and sovereignty? How does it affect your trust in Him?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Point 4: God's actions are for our benefit&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike megalomaniacs who harm themselves and others due to their disconnection from reality, God's actions towards humanity are explicitly intended for our benefit. He does not act out of irrationality or cruelty but out of love and concern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, God sent Jesus to die on the cross to provide forgiveness for our sins. This sacrifice demonstrates His immense love for us and His desire to reconcile us to Himself. It would be unfair to label such an act as megalomania because it is an act of selflessness and compassion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Point 5: God expects us to respond to His sacrifice&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While megalomaniacs often expect unwarranted adoration and obedience, God's expectation for us to respond to His sacrifice is not megalomania but common sense. When we understand the depth of His love and sacrifice for us, it is only natural that we would want to appreciate and follow Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God's expectation for a response is rooted in His desire for us to experience the fullness of life that comes through a relationship with Him. It is not an unhealthy obsession with power or control, but a genuine invitation to experience His love and grace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recognizing that God's expectations are rooted in love and not megalomania allows us to respond with gratitude and joy. It enables us to embrace the abundant life He offers and walk in obedience to His teachings, knowing they are for our benefit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Point 6: God's honesty and love refute megalomania&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Megalomania is characterized by dishonesty and a lack of concern for others. However, God presents Himself exactly as He is and displays tremendous love and concern for humanity. The Bible affirms God's honesty and love in numerous passages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/5/Romans-5-8.html"&gt;Romans 5:8&lt;/a&gt; states, "But God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us." This verse highlights God's selfless act of sacrifice as evidence of His love for humanity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By displaying honesty and love, God contradicts the characteristics of megalomania. He desires a genuine relationship with us and invites us to experience His truth and love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How does recognizing God's honesty and love impact your understanding of His character? How does it affect the way you relate to Him?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, labeling God as a megalomaniac is inaccurate and contradictory to biblical teachings. Megalomania involves delusion and harm, neither of which applies to God. His claims about Himself are true, and His actions towards humanity are rooted in love and concern. Recognizing God's true nature allows us to trust in His sovereignty, embrace His love, and respond to His sacrifice with gratitude and obedience.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/God and Evil/God’s Character"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Did God Create Evil? Unveiling the Divine Truth for Believers</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/did-god-create-evil/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-07-05T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-07-05T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-07-05:/did-god-create-evil/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Did God Create Evil?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evil is often thought of as a separate entity, but in reality, it is the absence of good. Just as darkness is the absence of light and cold is the absence of heat, evil is the absence of good. When God created all things, everything He …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Did God Create Evil?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evil is often thought of as a separate entity, but in reality, it is the absence of good. Just as darkness is the absence of light and cold is the absence of heat, evil is the absence of good. When God created all things, everything He made was good. However, in order for there to be a genuine choice between good and evil, God allowed for the possibility of evil to exist. This choice was given to both angels and humans, who had the freedom to choose either good or reject it (evil).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Absence of Good&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evil is not a tangible thing that needed to be created by God. It is simply the absence of good or the absence of God. Just as a hole cannot exist without something to create it in, evil cannot exist on its own. It only exists in relation to the absence of good. When there is a bad relationship between two good things, we call that evil. However, it does not become a separate entity that required God's creation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Free Will and Choice&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God wanted genuine relationships with His creatures, not robotic obedience. If God had not allowed for the possibility of evil, angels and humans would serve Him out of obligation rather than choice. By allowing free will and the potential for evil, God ensured that His creation could make decisions based on their own will. This freedom to choose allows us to have a real relationship with God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Mystery of God's Perspective&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As finite human beings, we are limited in our understanding of an infinite God. We may think we understand why God allows certain things to happen, but often our perspective is limited by our sinful nature and earthly viewpoint. We cannot fully comprehend God's holy and eternal perspective. Questions like why God put mankind on earth knowing they would sin cannot be adequately answered in this present life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Worshiping by Choice&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God allowed for the possibility of evil in order to give us a true choice in whether we worship Him. If evil did not exist, our worship would be based on obligation rather than a genuine decision of our own will. By allowing evil, God gives us the opportunity to choose Him freely and to genuinely worship Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GSToZ_4yh54" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding that evil is the absence of good helps us grasp the nature of God's creation. It reminds us that God created everything good and that evil is a result of the choices made by His creatures. Recognizing this truth can deepen our appreciation for the free will that God has bestowed upon us and the importance of making choices that align with His goodness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider the concept of free will and how it relates to your own life. How does the existence of evil impact your understanding of choice? Reflect on how your decisions can either align with God's goodness or lead to consequences that are contrary to His plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Christians, it is essential to recognize that God did not create evil, but He allowed for its existence. This understanding helps us maintain a faithful perspective while wrestling with difficult questions about the presence of evil in our world. While we may not fully comprehend God's reasons, we can trust in His perfect and holy nature, knowing that ultimately all things will work together for His glory.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/God and Evil/The Existence of Sin and Evil"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Does God Tempt Us to Sin? Understanding Biblical Truths</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/god-tempt-us-to-sin/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-06-29T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-06-29T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-06-29:/god-tempt-us-to-sin/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;God's Testing and Our Faith&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Bible, there are instances where it may seem like God tempts people to sin. However, a closer examination of the original Hebrew and Greek words used in these passages reveals a different meaning. For example, in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/22/Genesis-22-1.html"&gt;Genesis 22:1&lt;/a&gt;, the Hebrew word translated …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;God's Testing and Our Faith&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Bible, there are instances where it may seem like God tempts people to sin. However, a closer examination of the original Hebrew and Greek words used in these passages reveals a different meaning. For example, in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/22/Genesis-22-1.html"&gt;Genesis 22:1&lt;/a&gt;, the Hebrew word translated as "tempted" actually means "to test, try, prove, tempt, assay, put to the proof or test." This suggests that the purpose behind these tests is not to lead someone into sin but to evaluate or prove something. In this case, God was testing Abraham's faith by asking him to sacrifice his son, Isaac.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's important to note that &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/James/1/James-1-13.html"&gt;James 1:13&lt;/a&gt; provides a guiding principle: no one has the right to say that they have been tempted "of God." The word "of" indicates the origin of something. Temptations to sin do not originate with God. James makes it clear that God cannot be tempted with evil, and He does not tempt anyone to sin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, when we face temptations, we need to understand that God's purpose is not to make us fail or sin. Instead, it is to prove our faith and produce character. James encourages us to count it all joy when we face various trials because they test our faith and help us develop patience (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/James/1/James-1-3.html"&gt;James 1:3-4&lt;/a&gt;). These trials are not meant to lead us into sin but rather to strengthen our faith and demonstrate its validity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Source of Temptations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Utrd4tZnCrg" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it is true that there are temptations designed to make us fail, these temptations do not come from God. They come from Satan, his evil angels, or even from within ourselves. In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/4/Matthew-4-1.html"&gt;Matthew 4:1&lt;/a&gt;, we see that Jesus was tempted by Satan in the wilderness. &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Ephesians/6/Ephesians-6-12.html"&gt;Ephesians 6:12&lt;/a&gt; tells us that our struggle is not against flesh and blood but against spiritual forces of evil. &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/13/Romans-13-14.html"&gt;Romans 13:14&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Galatians/5/Galatians-5-13.html"&gt;Galatians 5:13&lt;/a&gt; remind us that we can also be tempted by our own sinful desires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God allows us to experience these temptations, but they are allowed for our benefit. They serve as opportunities for us to grow in our faith and overcome sin. It is through the testing of our faith that we can become stronger and more mature Christians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the nature of God's testing and temptation is crucial for our spiritual growth. It helps us navigate through challenging situations and make wise choices. Recognizing that God does not tempt us to sin but rather tests our faith allows us to approach trials with a different perspective. Instead of seeing them as obstacles or punishments, we can view them as opportunities for growth and character development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we face temptations, it is important to remember that God is with us, and He has given us the tools to resist and overcome them. We can rely on His strength and seek His guidance through prayer and studying His Word. By doing so, we can develop the character and resilience needed to resist temptations and live a life that honors God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Think About It&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How do you typically respond when faced with temptations? Do you see them as opportunities for growth or as something negative?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reflect on a time when you felt tested or tempted. How did you handle the situation? Did your faith play a role in your response?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What steps can you take to better rely on God's strength during times of testing and temptation? How can you cultivate a deeper relationship with Him?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember, God's purpose in testing our faith is not to lead us into sin but to strengthen us and help us grow. Embracing this perspective can transform how we approach challenges and deepen our walk with Christ&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/God and Evil/The Existence of Sin and Evil"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Can God Sin?

&lt;h3&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to answer the question of whether God can sin, we must first understand who God is. Our limited human minds struggle to fully comprehend God, but He has revealed Himself to us through His creation and His written Word. Creation's intricate design and order point us to the existence of an awe-inspiring Creator. The attributes of God, or His perfections, can be gleaned from Scripture, giving us a glimpse into His character.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Attributes of God&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eternality&lt;/strong&gt;: God is eternal, existing outside of time (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/90/Psalm-90-2.html"&gt;Psalm 90:2&lt;/a&gt;). He has no beginning or end.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Immutability&lt;/strong&gt;: God is unchanging (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/James/1/James-1-17.html"&gt;James 1:17&lt;/a&gt;). His character, purposes, and promises remain constant.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Love&lt;/strong&gt;: God is love (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-John/4/1-John-4-8.html"&gt;1 John 4:8&lt;/a&gt;). His love is unconditional, sacrificial, and selfless.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Omnipotence&lt;/strong&gt;: God is all-powerful (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Revelation/1/Revelation-1-8.html"&gt;Revelation 1:8&lt;/a&gt;). He has unlimited power and authority.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Omnipresence&lt;/strong&gt;: God is present everywhere at all times (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/139/Psalm-139-7.html"&gt;Psalm 139:7-11&lt;/a&gt;). He is not confined to any specific location.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Holiness&lt;/strong&gt;: God is absolutely pure and separate from evil (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Habakkuk/1/Habakkuk-1-13.html"&gt;Habakkuk 1:13&lt;/a&gt;). He is morally perfect.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Righteousness&lt;/strong&gt;: God is just and fair (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/11/Psalm-11-7.html"&gt;Psalm 11:7&lt;/a&gt;). He always acts in accordance with what is right.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Truth&lt;/strong&gt;: God is the embodiment of truth (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Titus/1/Titus-1-2.html"&gt;Titus 1:2&lt;/a&gt;). He is completely reliable and trustworthy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These attributes are true for each member of the Trinity - Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Nature of Sin&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sin is any thought, word, or action that goes against God's perfect standard of holiness and righteousness. It is a rebellion against God's authority and a violation of His moral law. Sin separates us from God and brings about spiritual death (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/6/Romans-6-23.html"&gt;Romans 6:23&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Can God Sin?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IgJSoN0Bwj0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because God is holy, righteous, and true, He cannot sin. His attributes are inseparable from His nature. If God were to sin, He would cease to be God. The fact that God is "holy, holy, holy" prevents Him from doing anything unholy or sinful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding that God cannot sin is crucial for our faith. It assures us of His unwavering character and reliability. We can trust in His promises and rest in the knowledge that He will always act in accordance with His perfect nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact that God cannot sin does not mean that He is incapable of understanding our struggles with sin. In an incredible act of love, God chose to involve Himself in mankind's sin. He sent His one and only Son, Jesus Christ, to die on the cross as a sacrifice for our sins. Through faith in Jesus' sacrifice, we can be forgiven and reconciled with God (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-Peter/3/1-Peter-3-18.html"&gt;1 Peter 3:18&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/3/Romans-3-23.html"&gt;Romans 3:23-25&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, while our human understanding may be limited, the Bible reveals that God cannot sin. His holiness, righteousness, and other perfections are inherent to His character. This truth is foundational to our faith and enables us to trust in a God who is unchanging and morally perfect.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/God and Evil/God’s Character"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Why Did God Allow the Holocaust: Divine Purpose Revealed</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/god-allow-holocaust/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-06-15T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-06-15T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-06-15:/god-allow-holocaust/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;God's Allowance of Evil in the World&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem of evil is a challenging issue that many believers grapple with. We often ask ourselves, "Why does God allow evil to exist?" This question becomes even more difficult when we consider atrocities like the Holocaust. Could God have prevented such a horrific event? The answer is yes, He could have. However, it is essential to understand that God's allowance of evil does not mean He approves of it. In fact, God is grieved by the sinfulness and hardness of human hearts (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/6/Genesis-6-6.html"&gt;Genesis 6:6&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/3/Mark-3-5.html"&gt;Mark 3:5&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Mystery of God's Ways&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God's ways and thoughts are infinitely higher than ours (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/55/Isaiah-55-8.html"&gt;Isaiah 55:8-9&lt;/a&gt;). His sovereign plan encompasses the entire scope of history, including every possible cause and effect, potentiality, and contingency. We cannot fathom the intricacies of His design. It is a matter of faith to trust that His plan is the best possible way to restore fallen humanity and a cursed world to righteousness and blessing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;God's Permission and Approval&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NW2dgvRi8lA" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is important to differentiate between God's permission and His approval. Just as God allowed Adam to eat from the forbidden tree without approving of his action, God permits evil actions to occur while disapproving of them. The Holocaust was a result of mankind's continued rebellion against God. While nothing can justify the evil of the Holocaust, we can find solace in knowing that God has done everything possible to redeem humanity from sin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Role of Human Responsibility&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The blame for the Holocaust lies squarely on the shoulders of sinful humanity. It was the product of sinful choices made by individuals in rebellion against a holy God. The rise of Nazism and the subsequent horrors were facilitated by millions who followed Hitler and his destructive policies. Additionally, the silence and acquiescence of many churches and world leaders during this time allowed the Holocaust to unfold. The question then becomes, not why did God allow it, but why did we?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Freedom of Choice&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God has given mankind freedom of choice. We can choose to follow Him and stand for righteousness or rebel against Him and pursue evil. The problem lies in the heart of man, which is deceitful above all things and beyond cure (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Jeremiah/17/Jeremiah-17-9.html"&gt;Jeremiah 17:9&lt;/a&gt;). Until humanity's heart turns to God, the world will continue to witness acts of evil like ethnic cleansings, genocides, and atrocities such as the Holocaust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question of why God allows evil is a significant theological issue that challenges our understanding of His nature and His role in the world. Wrestling with this question deepens our faith and forces us to trust in God's wisdom and sovereignty. It can also lead us to reflect on our own responsibility in the face of evil and injustice, encouraging us to take a stand for righteousness and justice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Think About It&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does understanding God's permission versus approval help you reconcile the existence of evil in the world?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reflect on the role of human responsibility in allowing evil to occur. How can we learn from history to prevent similar atrocities in the future?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consider how your understanding of God's sovereignty affects your faith. How does trusting in His plan bring comfort even in the face of evil?&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goodness of God is a fundamental aspect of Christian theology. Despite the presence of evil in the world, the Bible affirms that God is good and loving. In this article, we will explore the goodness of God and how it is demonstrated in various ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Origin of Evil&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The evil in the world did not come from God. According to the Bible, Adam and Eve were tempted by the devil and sinned, which led to a rupture in their relationship with God. As a result, mankind hid from God in guilt and fear. While Adam and Eve can be blamed for their actions, it is important to understand that all humans have sinned and fallen short of God's glory (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/3/Romans-3-23.html"&gt;Romans 3:23&lt;/a&gt;). If we were in their place, we would have likely sinned as well. However, despite humanity's fall into sin, God has a plan to redeem mankind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;God's Plan of Redemption&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God's goodness is evident through His plan to redeem fallen humanity. The salvation offered through Jesus Christ attests to His goodness and love (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/5/Romans-5-8.html"&gt;Romans 5:8&lt;/a&gt;). The effects of the Fall are universal, but so is the offer of divine grace (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/3/John-3-16.html"&gt;John 3:16&lt;/a&gt;). The Bible clearly communicates the devastating effects of sin on humanity and our inability to solve our own sin problem. Understanding the doctrine of sin is crucial to grasping God's remedy for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Role of Satan&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CJbSlrbmxus" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While humans bear responsibility for their actions, the blame for evil in the world should be placed squarely on Satan. Jesus referred to Satan as "the ruler of this world" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/12/John-12-31.html"&gt;John 12:31&lt;/a&gt;), indicating that he has been given a certain authority over the earth. Satan is described as a fierce enemy who comes only to kill, steal, and destroy (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/10/John-10-10.html"&gt;John 10:10&lt;/a&gt;). He is a liar and a murderer (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/8/John-8-44.html"&gt;John 8:44&lt;/a&gt;). In contrast, Jesus is the Good Shepherd who gives His life for the sheep (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/10/John-10-11.html"&gt;John 10:11&lt;/a&gt;). He is the Lamb of God who was sacrificed for us (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Revelation/5/Revelation-5-6.html"&gt;Revelation 5:6&lt;/a&gt;). Jesus is the embodiment of goodness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;God's Ultimate Victory over Evil&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God's goodness is manifest in His plan to ultimately rid the universe of evil. He is a God of justice, and He will one day make all things right (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/89/Psalm-89-14.html"&gt;Psalm 89:14&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Revelation/21/Revelation-21-5.html"&gt;Revelation 21:5&lt;/a&gt;). Sin and evil will be dealt with in perfect judgment (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Revelation/20/Revelation-20-13.html"&gt;Revelation 20:13&lt;/a&gt;). Through Christ, we have the promise that "the God of peace will soon crush Satan under your feet" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/16/Romans-16-20.html"&gt;Romans 16:20&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;God's Provision and Love&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God's goodness is also evident in His provision for His children. He gives life to all and upholds everything by His wisdom and power (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/1/Hebrews-1-3.html"&gt;Hebrews 1:3&lt;/a&gt;). He is patient with sinners, desiring them to come to repentance and find eternal life (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/2-Peter/3/2-Peter-3-9.html"&gt;2 Peter 3:9&lt;/a&gt;). God offers us eternal life and abundant life now, free from the penalty of sin (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/6/Romans-6-23.html"&gt;Romans 6:23&lt;/a&gt;). He is "rich in mercy" because of His great love for us (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Ephesians/2/Ephesians-2-4.html"&gt;Ephesians 2:4&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Love of God&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ultimate expression of God's goodness is seen in His love. The Bible teaches that "God is love" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-John/4/1-John-4-7.html"&gt;1 John 4:7-8&lt;/a&gt;), and this love is demonstrated through the sacrifice of Jesus on the cross. Jesus willingly gave His life and shed His blood for the sins of those who put their faith in Him. This act of love proves that God is just and loving. No one can charge Him with injustice (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/9/Romans-9-14.html"&gt;Romans 9:14&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the goodness of God is crucial for our faith. It helps us make sense of the presence of evil in the world and provides hope in the midst of suffering. Recognizing that God is good and has a plan to redeem humanity gives us confidence in His promises and assures us that He will ultimately triumph over evil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think About It:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider the ways in which you have experienced God's goodness in your life. How has His provision and love impacted you? Reflect on the sacrifice of Jesus and how it demonstrates God's ultimate goodness. How does understanding God's goodness influence your perspective on the presence of evil in the world?&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/God and Evil/The Existence of Sin and Evil"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Divine Justice Unveiled: Understanding God's Act of Killing</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/god-killing/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-06-11T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-06-11T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-06-11:/god-killing/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;God's Actions in the Old Testament&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;God's actions in the Old Testament, specifically instances where He is recorded as killing multitudes of people, have led to some misconceptions and questions about His character. It is important to note that the English translation of the sixth commandment in the King James Version, which reads "Thou shalt not kill" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Exodus/20/Exodus-20-13.html"&gt;Exodus 20:13&lt;/a&gt;), has contributed to this confusion. However, the original Hebrew word, "ratsach," is more accurately translated as "murder" rather than "kill." Modern translations render the command as "You shall not murder." The Bible in Basic English conveys its meaning as "Do not put anyone to death without cause."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is true that God intentionally killed many people throughout history. However, it is crucial to differentiate between killing and murder. Murder refers to the premeditated and unlawful taking of a life, while killing encompasses a broader scope of taking a life. The same Law that forbids murder permits killing in self-defense (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Exodus/22/Exodus-22-2.html"&gt;Exodus 22:2&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order for God to commit murder, He would have to act unlawfully. It is important to recognize that God is God — His works are perfect, all His ways are just, and He does no wrong (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Deuteronomy/32/Deuteronomy-32-4.html"&gt;Deuteronomy 32:4&lt;/a&gt;). When humanity disobeys God, they face His wrath (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Exodus/19/Exodus-19-5.html"&gt;Exodus 19:5&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Exodus/23/Exodus-23-21.html"&gt;Exodus 23:21-22&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Leviticus/26/Leviticus-26-14.html"&gt;Leviticus 26:14-18&lt;/a&gt;). Additionally, God is described as a just judge who is angry with the wicked every day (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/7/Psalm-7-11.html"&gt;Psalm 7:11-12&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some argue that executing the innocent constitutes murder. However, from a biblical perspective, there are no truly innocent people compared to God's holiness. All have sinned (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/3/Romans-3-23.html"&gt;Romans 3:23&lt;/a&gt;), and the penalty for sin is death (Romans 6:23a). God has just cause to wipe out humanity, but His mercy spares us from complete destruction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;God's Actions in the Old Testament: Examples&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout the Old Testament, there are specific instances where God chose to bring about death and destruction. Let's explore some of these examples to gain a better understanding:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Flood&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most well-known instances is the story of the Great Flood, where God decided to destroy all living creatures except for Noah, his family, and the animals on the ark (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/7/Genesis-7-21.html"&gt;Genesis 7:21-23&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-Peter/3/1-Peter-3-20.html"&gt;1 Peter 3:20&lt;/a&gt;). God's decision to wipe out humanity was justified by the wickedness that had consumed the earth. The Bible states, "Then the LORD saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth and that every intent of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/6/Genesis-6-5.html"&gt;Genesis 6:5&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Conquest of Canaan&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the conquest of Canaan by the Israelites, God commanded them to destroy entire cities and nations, leaving nothing alive (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Deuteronomy/20/Deuteronomy-20-16.html"&gt;Deuteronomy 20:16-17&lt;/a&gt;). This command was given because the Canaanites were engaged in abominable practices, including burning their own children as sacrifices to their gods (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Deuteronomy/12/Deuteronomy-12-31.html"&gt;Deuteronomy 12:31&lt;/a&gt;). God used Israel as an instrument of judgment against these evil practices and wanted to prevent Israel from following in their footsteps (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Deuteronomy/20/Deuteronomy-20-18.html"&gt;Deuteronomy 20:18&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;God's Mercy Amidst Judgment&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even in these dire judgments, God offered mercy. For example, before destroying Sodom and Gomorrah, God promised Abraham that He would spare the whole city if just ten righteous people could be found there. Although ten righteous individuals were not found, God saved "righteous Lot" and his family (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/18/Genesis-18-32.html"&gt;Genesis 18:32&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/19/Genesis-19-15.html"&gt;Genesis 19:15&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/2-Peter/2/2-Peter-2-7.html"&gt;2 Peter 2:7&lt;/a&gt;). Similarly, during the destruction of Jericho, God spared Rahab the harlot and her family because of her faith (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Joshua/6/Joshua-6-25.html"&gt;Joshua 6:25&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/11/Hebrews-11-31.html"&gt;Hebrews 11:31&lt;/a&gt;). These instances demonstrate that, even in judgment, God extends mercy to those who trust in Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Understanding God's Actions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eSujxG5gJLM" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It can be challenging to understand why God would order such devastating actions. However, it is important to approach these events from a biblical perspective and consider some key points:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;God's Holiness and Justice&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God is holy and just, and He cannot tolerate sin or evil. His actions are ultimately motivated by His perfect nature. When confronted with unrepentant wickedness, God's justice demands a response. The destruction He brings upon sinful nations and individuals is a reflection of His righteousness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Human Sinfulness&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a biblical standpoint, every person is tainted by sin. Compared to God's holiness, there are no truly innocent individuals. All have fallen short of God's standards (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/3/Romans-3-23.html"&gt;Romans 3:23&lt;/a&gt;). Therefore, when God executes judgment on humanity, it is not an act of murder but rather a just response to sin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;God's Mercy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the judgments recorded in the Old Testament, God consistently displays mercy. He offers opportunities for repentance and salvation. The examples of Lot and Rahab show that God is willing to spare those who exhibit faith in Him. It is through His mercy that anyone can find forgiveness and salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Final Judgment&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is essential to remember that the judgments depicted in the Old Testament are not the final word. Each person will face their own judgment when they die (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/9/Hebrews-9-27.html"&gt;Hebrews 9:27&lt;/a&gt;). God, as a just judge, holds the unrighteous accountable for their actions (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/2-Peter/2/2-Peter-2-9.html"&gt;2 Peter 2:9&lt;/a&gt;). However, He has also provided a way for salvation through Jesus Christ (Romans 6:23b). In Christ, believers can receive the gift of eternal life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding God's actions in the Old Testament is crucial for believers. It allows them to grasp the depth of God's holiness, justice, and mercy. Recognizing God's righteousness in executing judgment helps us appreciate His perfect nature and understand the consequences of sin. Additionally, comprehending His mercy in offering salvation through faith in Jesus Christ allows believers to embrace the hope and assurance of eternal life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Think About It&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reflecting on God's actions in the Old Testament prompts several important questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does understanding God's justice and holiness impact your view of sin?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does recognizing God's mercy influence your perception of His character?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In what ways can you demonstrate gratitude for God's gift of salvation through Jesus Christ?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can a deeper understanding of God's actions in the Old Testament strengthen your faith?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take time to ponder these questions and seek a deeper understanding of God's nature through prayer, study, and reflection on His Word.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/God and Evil/God’s Character"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Divine Hope Amid House Fire Tragedies: 5 Ways Christians Can Find Strength</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/house-fire/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-06-03T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-06-03T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-06-03:/house-fire/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;House Fires and God's Response&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;House fires can be devastating events that cause significant loss and distress. As Christians, it is natural to turn to the Bible for guidance and understanding during difficult times. In this article, we will explore how the Bible provides comfort and wisdom in the face of house fires and other tragedies. We will examine several key points that help us make sense of these events and find hope in God's plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Point 1: Trusting in the Lord&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In times of tragedy, it can be challenging to understand why such events occur. However, the Bible encourages us to trust in the Lord with all our hearts and not rely on our own understanding (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Proverbs/3/Proverbs-3-5.html"&gt;Proverbs 3:5-6&lt;/a&gt;). As finite human beings, we have limitations in comprehending God's plans and purposes fully. God is all-knowing, all-powerful, and always present. We must acknowledge Him in all our ways, knowing that He will guide our paths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Trusting in the Lord enables us to find peace and comfort even when faced with devastating events like house fires. It reminds us that God is in control and has a plan, even if we cannot fully comprehend it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; Reflect on a time when you had to trust in the Lord despite not understanding the circumstances. How did that experience shape your faith?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Point 2: God's Purpose in Tragedy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can be challenging to see any good coming from a tragedy like a house fire. However, &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/8/Romans-8-28.html"&gt;Romans 8:28&lt;/a&gt; assures us that God works for the good of those who love Him and are called according to His purpose. While we may not always see how God is working for our good, we can have faith that He has a bigger picture in mind. Job, despite facing immense suffering and loss, demonstrated unwavering faith in the Lord by saying, "Though he slay me, I will hope in him" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Job/13/Job-13-15.html"&gt;Job 13:15&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Recognizing God's purpose in tragedy helps us find meaning and hope even in the midst of devastation. It allows us to trust that God can bring good out of any situation, even when it seems impossible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; Can you think of a time when you witnessed God bringing good out of a difficult situation? How did that experience deepen your trust in Him?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Point 3: The Reality of Sin and Imperfection&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When faced with tragedy, we may question why bad things happen to seemingly "good" people. However, the Bible reminds us that none of us are truly "good" compared to God's perfection. &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/3/Romans-3-23.html"&gt;Romans 3:23&lt;/a&gt; states that all have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God. The consequence of sin is death, which is eternal separation from God. However, through Jesus' sacrificial death on the cross, we can receive forgiveness and salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Understanding the reality of sin helps us recognize our need for redemption and the importance of placing our faith in Jesus. It also reminds us that we live in an imperfect world affected by the sin of others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; Reflect on your own sinfulness and the need for a Savior. How does this understanding shape your perspective on tragedy?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Point 4: God's Purposes in Tragedy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tragedies like house fires can serve various purposes in God's plan. They may test our trust in Him, draw people to faith in Jesus, deepen our relationship with Him, increase our ability to reflect His love, or prepare us for future service. &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/12/Hebrews-12-4.html"&gt;Hebrews 12:4-13&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/James/1/James-1-2.html"&gt;James 1:2-3&lt;/a&gt; remind us that suffering can produce endurance, character, and spiritual growth. In times of tragedy, we can find comfort in knowing that God has a purpose for our pain and is working through it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ia1DOC0_skw" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Recognizing God's purposes in tragedy helps us find hope and meaning in the midst of suffering. It encourages us to persevere and trust that God is using our experiences for His glory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; Consider a difficult situation you have faced and how it has shaped your character or faith. How did God use that experience to bring about growth or transformation?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Point 5: God's Care and Comfort&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During times of tragedy, it can be difficult to believe that God cares for us. However, &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/10/Matthew-10-29.html"&gt;Matthew 10:29-31&lt;/a&gt; assures us that God knows even when a sparrow falls, and if He cares for the birds, He surely cares for us. Jesus, who experienced humanity and understands our weaknesses, offers comfort and sustains us through our trials (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/2/Hebrews-2-14.html"&gt;Hebrews 2:14&lt;/a&gt;, 4:15).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Knowing that God cares for us brings comfort and reassurance during times of loss and devastation. It reminds us that we are not alone in our suffering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; Reflect on a time when you experienced God's care and comfort during a difficult season. How did His presence sustain you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Point 6: Finding Hope in Christ's Return&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we may endure suffering and tragedy in this present world, we have hope in the future return of Jesus. &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/8/Romans-8-18.html"&gt;Romans 8:18-25&lt;/a&gt; reminds us that the sufferings of this world are not worth comparing to the glory that will be revealed in us. The return of Jesus will bring about a new heaven and earth, free from pain, sadness, and all forms of tragedy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; The hope of Christ's return gives us strength to persevere through present trials. It reminds us that our suffering is temporary and that a glorious future awaits us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; How does the hope of Christ's return impact your perspective on the tragedies and challenges you face in life?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;House fires and other tragedies can be overwhelming and difficult to understand. However, as Christians, we can find comfort and hope in the promises of God. By trusting in the Lord, recognizing His purposes in tragedy, acknowledging our sinfulness, understanding His plans, and finding solace in His care, we can navigate through these challenging times with faith and hope. Ultimately, our hope rests in the return of Jesus, where all suffering and tragedy will be redeemed and replaced with eternal joy in His presence.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/God and Evil/Hardships"></category></entry><entry><title>"The Divine Justice Behind Canaanites' Extermination: Unveiling God"'s Purpose'</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/canaanites-extermination/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-06-02T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-06-02T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-06-02:/canaanites-extermination/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Canaanites Extermination&lt;/h2&gt;

While we …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Canaanites Extermination&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The extermination of the Canaanites by the Israelites is a topic that raises difficult questions and challenges our understanding of God's character. In order to fully grasp the reasoning behind this command, it is important to examine the biblical context and the reasons given in Scripture. While we may not fully comprehend God's ways, we can seek to understand His purposes as revealed in His Word.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Wickedness of the Canaanites&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One reason given in Scripture for the extermination of the Canaanites is their extreme wickedness. The Canaanite culture was marked by heinous sins and abominable practices, including incest, child sacrifice, homosexuality, and bestiality. Leviticus 18 provides a list of these sins that Israel was commanded to avoid at all costs. The land itself had become defiled by the sinful practices of its inhabitants. In ordering the destruction of the Canaanites, God enacted a form of corporate capital punishment on a people that had been deserving of judgment for some time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Preventing Idolatry and Compromise&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another reason for the extermination of the Canaanites was to prevent religious compromise and spiritual adultery. God warned that if the Israelites left survivors among the Canaanites, they would be led astray and tempted to follow their detestable practices. The Israelites were prone to compromise with Canaanite culture and fell into idolatry time and again. By completely eradicating the Canaanite nations, God sought to protect His relationship with His chosen people and guard them from spiritual harm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Future Problems Averted&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God's knowledge of the future played a role in His command to exterminate certain people groups. He knew that if Israel did not completely eradicate their enemies, there would be future problems. The Amalekites, although not Canaanites themselves, attacked Israel multiple times and formed alliances with the Canaanites. King Saul was given the responsibility to exterminate the Amalekites, but he failed to fully obey God's command. As a result, several decades later, the Amalekites were able to take captives from David and his men. Furthermore, a descendant of the Amalekites, Haman, sought to exterminate the entire Jewish people in the time of Esther. The incomplete obedience of Saul almost resulted in Israel's destruction. God's command to eliminate these groups was intended to prevent future harm and preserve the well-being of His people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lu1EYXr0Me4" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Fulfillment of a Curse&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Centuries before the command to exterminate the Canaanites, Noah had pronounced a curse on one of Ham's sons, Canaan. This curse declared that Canaan would be the lowest of slaves to his brothers. Canaan was the ancestor of the Canaanite people. When Joshua led the Israelites into Canaan, they conquered the Canaanite nations as part of their inheritance. Not all of the Canaanites were exterminated; some became slaves as Noah's prophecy was fulfilled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Understanding Difficult Aspects&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most challenging aspects of God's command to exterminate the Canaanites is that women and children were not spared. It is crucial to approach this issue with care and consider several points:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No one is innately innocent or sinless. Scripture teaches that all have sinned and fallen short of God's glory (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/51/Psalm-51-5.html"&gt;Psalm 51:5&lt;/a&gt;; 58:3). The women and children in Canaan were participants in the sinful practices of their culture, and allowing them to live would have perpetuated those practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The children would have grown up sympathetic to evil religions and practices. By eliminating them, God prevented future generations from continuing in the same wickedness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These children would have likely harbored resentment toward the Israelites and sought revenge for the perceived injustice against their fathers. This would have perpetuated a cycle of violence and hostility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although we may struggle to fully comprehend God's actions, we must recognize His sovereignty over all life. He alone has the right to give and take life, and how and when we die is ultimately up to Him. In the case of the Canaanites, God had given them ample time to repent, but they remained resistant to Him. Their destruction served as a form of judgment for their persistent wickedness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The extermination of the Canaanites raises significant theological questions about God's character and His dealings with humanity. Understanding the reasons behind this command can help us grapple with these difficult questions and deepen our trust in God's wisdom and justice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How does the wickedness of the Canaanites challenge our understanding of God's grace and mercy?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What lessons can we learn from God's command to exterminate the Canaanites about the seriousness of sin and the need for repentance?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How does God's role as judge reflect His commitment to righteousness and justice?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can we reconcile the command to exterminate the Canaanites with the biblical teaching on love, compassion, and forgiveness?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In what ways can we apply the lessons from this biblical account to our own lives today?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The issue of violence in the Old Testament has long been a topic of controversy and criticism.

However, it is essential to examine whether these …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Old Testament Violence&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The issue of violence in the Old Testament has long been a topic of controversy and criticism. Critics argue that the God of the Old Testament is portrayed as a vindictive and bloodthirsty deity, commanding genocide and indiscriminate massacre. However, it is essential to examine whether these criticisms are valid, or if there may be morally sufficient reasons behind God's commands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Canaanite Culture&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A basic understanding of Canaanite culture reveals its inherent moral wickedness. The Canaanites were a brutal and aggressive people who engaged in practices such as bestiality, incest, and even child sacrifice. Their deviant sexual acts were considered normal. God's judgment was primarily directed at the Canaanite religion rather than the people themselves. It is important to note that individual Canaanites who repented could find mercy (Joshua 2). God's desire is for the wicked to turn from their sins rather than face destruction (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Ezekiel/18/Ezekiel-18-31.html"&gt;Ezekiel 18:31&lt;/a&gt;–32; 33:11).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Role of Israel in God's Plan&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God used the conquest of Canaan to create a religious and historical context in which He could introduce the Messiah to the world. This Messiah would bring salvation not only to Israel but also to Israel's enemies, including Canaan (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/87/Psalm-87-4.html"&gt;Psalm 87:4&lt;/a&gt;–6; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/7/Mark-7-25.html"&gt;Mark 7:25&lt;/a&gt;–30). The purpose of this conquest was not only to punish the sinful nations but also to bring about redemption and salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Time for Repentance&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is worth noting that God gave the Canaanite people over 400 years to repent of their evil ways. The book of Hebrews refers to them as "disobedient," suggesting moral culpability on their part (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/11/Hebrews-11-31.html"&gt;Hebrews 11:31&lt;/a&gt;). The Canaanites were aware of God's power and had the opportunity to seek repentance. Unfortunately, they continued their rebellion against God until the end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Killing Non-Combatants&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Critics often point out that God commanded the Israelites to kill non-combatants. While it is true that the Canaanite women did not fight, their seductive behavior in Numbers 25 indicates their participation in the sinful practices of their culture (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Numbers/25/Numbers-25-1.html"&gt;Numbers 25:1&lt;/a&gt;–3). Additionally, it is important to recognize that no human person, including infants, is truly innocent. Scripture teaches that all people are born in sin (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/51/Psalm-51-5.html"&gt;Psalm 51:5&lt;/a&gt;; 58:3). Infants are as morally culpable for Adam's sin as adults are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;God's Sovereignty Over Life&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God is sovereign over all life and has the right to give or take it as He sees fit. He ultimately takes every person's life at death. While it is wrong for humans to take a life, except in cases of capital punishment, war, and self-defense, it does not mean that it is wrong for God to do so. God alone has the authority to determine when and how life ends. Ultimately, our lives belong to Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Consideration for Children&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FPyjIMn5-yg" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One might argue that it would have been cruel for God to spare only the infants and children of Canaan, as they would have faced death due to starvation without the protection and support of their parents. Moreover, these children would likely have grown up sympathetic to the evil religions practiced by their parents. By ending the culture of idolatry and perversion in Canaan, God sought to protect future generations from continuing in those sinful practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Eternal State of Infants&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fate of the infants killed in Canaan raises questions about their eternal state. If God took them before reaching moral accountability, they would have gone straight to heaven. In this view, those children are in a far better place than if they had lived into adulthood as Canaanites. It is essential to trust in God's justice and mercy, even in difficult and complex situations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the violence in the Old Testament is crucial for believers as it helps us grapple with challenging theological questions. It allows us to explore God's character and His ways, recognizing that His perspective is eternal and beyond our understanding. By examining the context and reasons behind God's commands, we can deepen our faith and trust in His sovereignty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does knowing the moral wickedness of the Canaanite culture affect your understanding of God's judgment?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are some possible reasons why God commanded the destruction of Canaan?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does the concept of God's sovereignty over life challenge or strengthen your faith?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reflect on the eternal state of infants killed in Canaan. How does this perspective influence your understanding of God's justice and mercy?&lt;/li&gt;

Understanding Adam and Eve's Sin in Christian Perspective</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/if-god-knew-adam-eve-sin/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-05-25T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-05-25T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-05-25:/if-god-knew-adam-eve-sin/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;If God Knew Adam and Eve Would Sin&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bible tells us that God created all things, including humanity, for His own glory (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/11/Romans-11-36.html"&gt;Romans 11:36&lt;/a&gt;). However, it may be challenging to understand how the fall of Adam and Eve, their sinning against God's command, could bring glory to Him …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;If God Knew Adam and Eve Would Sin&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bible tells us that God created all things, including humanity, for His own glory (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/11/Romans-11-36.html"&gt;Romans 11:36&lt;/a&gt;). However, it may be challenging to understand how the fall of Adam and Eve, their sinning against God's command, could bring glory to Him. Some may even question why God would create them if He knew in advance the trouble they would cause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God is omniscient and knows the future (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/139/Psalm-139-1.html"&gt;Psalm 139:1&lt;/a&gt;–6; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/46/Isaiah-46-10.html"&gt;Isaiah 46:10&lt;/a&gt;), so He definitely knew that Adam and Eve would sin. Yet, He still chose to create them with free will, allowing them to choose to sin. It's important to note that God is not the author of sin or the one who tempted them to sin (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/James/1/James-1-13.html"&gt;James 1:13&lt;/a&gt;). The fall of mankind serves the purpose of God's overall plan for creation and humanity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we consider the overarching storyline of Scripture, we can divide biblical history into three main sections: paradise (Genesis 1—2), paradise lost (Genesis 3—Revelation 20), and paradise regained (Revelation 21—22). The largest part of this narrative revolves around the transition from paradise lost to paradise regained. At the center of this meta-narrative is the cross, which was planned from the very beginning (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Acts/2/Acts-2-23.html"&gt;Acts 2:23&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From studying Scripture carefully, we can draw the following conclusions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The fall of mankind was foreknown by God.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The crucifixion of Christ, serving as the atonement for God's elect, was foreordained by God.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All people will one day glorify God (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/86/Psalm-86-9.html"&gt;Psalm 86:9&lt;/a&gt;), and God intends to bring unity to all things under Christ (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Ephesians/1/Ephesians-1-10.html"&gt;Ephesians 1:10&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God's purpose was to create a world where His glory could be fully manifest. The glory of God is the ultimate goal of creation. Everything God does is aimed at displaying His glory. The universe was brought into existence to showcase God's glory (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/19/Psalm-19-1.html"&gt;Psalm 19:1&lt;/a&gt;), and His wrath is revealed against those who fail to glorify Him (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/1/Romans-1-18.html"&gt;Romans 1:18&lt;/a&gt;–25). The world we have, with its fall, redemption, and future restoration, best displays the glory of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iIblBQoVME0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;God's wrath and mercy both reveal the richness of His glory, but we cannot fully comprehend either without the fall of mankind. We would never truly understand grace if we had never needed it. Therefore, every aspect of God's plan— including the fall, election, redemption, and atonement— serves the purpose of glorifying Him. When Adam and Eve fell into sin, God's mercy was immediately displayed in not executing immediate judgment. His grace was evident in providing a covering for their shame (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/3/Genesis-3-21.html"&gt;Genesis 3:21&lt;/a&gt;). As mankind descended further into sin, God's patience and forbearance were demonstrated. His justice and wrath were displayed through the flood, while His mercy and grace were seen in saving Noah and his family. In the future, God's holy wrath and perfect justice will be revealed when He deals with Satan once and for all (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Revelation/20/Revelation-20-7.html"&gt;Revelation 20:7&lt;/a&gt;–10).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God's love is also a manifestation of His glory (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-John/4/1-John-4-16.html"&gt;1 John 4:16&lt;/a&gt;). Our understanding of God's love comes from knowing Jesus Christ and His saving work in this fallen world. "This is how God showed his love among us: He sent his one and only Son into the world that we might live through him" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-John/4/1-John-4-9.html"&gt;1 John 4:9&lt;/a&gt;). If God had chosen not to create Adam and Eve based on His knowledge of their fall or if He had made them devoid of free will, we would never have truly known what love is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ultimate display of God's glory occurred at the cross, where His wrath, justice, and mercy intersected. The righteous judgment for all sin was executed, and God's grace was shown through Jesus' words, "Father, forgive them" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/23/Luke-23-34.html"&gt;Luke 23:34&lt;/a&gt;). God's love and grace are evident in those whom He has saved (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/3/John-3-16.html"&gt;John 3:16&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Ephesians/2/Ephesians-2-8.html"&gt;Ephesians 2:8&lt;/a&gt;–10). Ultimately, God will be glorified as His chosen people worship Him for eternity alongside the angels. Even the wicked will glorify God as His righteousness results in the eternal punishment of unrepentant sinners (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Philippians/2/Philippians-2-11.html"&gt;Philippians 2:11&lt;/a&gt;). Without the fall of Adam and Eve, we would never fully comprehend God's justice, grace, mercy, or love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some may argue that if God foreknew and foreordained the fall, it compromises human freedom. If God created humanity with full knowledge of their future fall into sin, how can humans be responsible for their own sin? The Westminster Confession of Faith addresses this concern by stating that "God, from all eternity, did, by the most wise and holy counsel of his own will, freely and unchangeably ordain whatsoever comes to pass; yet so, as thereby neither is God the author of sin, nor is violence offered to the will of the creatures; nor is the liberty or contingency of second causes taken away, but rather established" (WFC, III.1).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, God ordains future events in a way that preserves our freedom and the working of secondary causes such as natural laws. Theologians refer to this as "concurrence." God's sovereign will operates simultaneously with our free choices in such a way that our choices always align with His will (while maintaining that our choices are not coerced). It may seem complex, but as the Creator God, He can handle any amount of complexity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary, God knew in advance that Adam and Eve would sin, but He still chose to create them with free will. The fall of mankind serves the purpose of God's overall plan for His creation and humanity. God's ultimate goal is to display His glory, and the fall of Adam and Eve, along with all subsequent events, plays a role in achieving this goal. The cross of Jesus Christ stands at the center of God's plan, where His wrath, justice, and mercy intersected to bring about redemption. Through the fall, we come to understand God's justice, grace, mercy, and love in a way that would not have been possible otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/God and Evil/The Existence of Sin and Evil"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Why God Allows Handicapped Individuals: Understanding His Divine Plan</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/god-allow-disabled-handicapped/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-05-24T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-05-24T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-05-24:/god-allow-disabled-handicapped/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;God's Purpose for Disabled and Handicapped Individuals&lt;/h2&gt;

While it may be difficult to understand why God allows some individuals to be born with disabilities or to acquire them later …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;God's Purpose for Disabled and Handicapped Individuals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bible teaches us that God is the creator of all people, including those who are physically disabled or mentally handicapped. While it may be difficult to understand why God allows some individuals to be born with disabilities or to acquire them later in life, we can find answers within the framework of the theological/philosophical debate known as "the problem of evil" or "the problem of pain." This debate seeks to reconcile the existence of suffering and brokenness in the world with the goodness and perfection of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1. The Impact of Original Sin&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disabilities and handicaps are a result of the fallen nature of our world, which began with mankind's rebellion against God. Sin entered the world through disobedience, and with it came sickness, imperfection, and disease. While not every disability can be directly attributed to personal sin (as Jesus clarified in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/9/John-9-1.html"&gt;John 9:1&lt;/a&gt;–3), generally speaking, disabilities and handicaps can be traced back to the existence of sin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Recognizing that disabilities are a consequence of living in a fallen world helps us understand that God did not design us to experience such limitations. It points us towards a future where we will be free from these afflictions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; How does understanding the impact of sin on the world shape our perspective on disabilities? How can we show compassion and support to disabled individuals?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2. Displaying God's Works and Glory&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God can use disabilities and handicaps as opportunities to display His works and bring glory to Himself. When Jesus encountered a man who was born blind, He explained that the man's condition existed so "that the works of God might be displayed in him" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/9/John-9-3.html"&gt;John 9:3&lt;/a&gt;). Through healing miracles, Jesus demonstrated His power and authority over physical limitations, leading many to believe in Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, when Lazarus fell ill, Jesus declared that his sickness was for the glory of God, so that people witnessing the miracle of his resurrection would believe (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/11/John-11-4.html"&gt;John 11:4&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Recognizing that God can use disabilities to display His power and bring people to faith encourages us to trust in Him even in the midst of physical limitations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; How can we see God's works and glory displayed through disabled individuals today? How does this challenge our understanding of what it means to be "able-bodied"?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;3. Learning to Trust in God&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God allows disabilities and handicaps to teach us to rely on Him rather than on our own abilities. When God called Moses, who struggled with speech, Moses tried to use his disability as an excuse for not fulfilling God's call. However, God assured Moses that He would help him speak and teach him what to say. In doing so, God demonstrated that all human ability and disability are part of His plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Disabilities remind us that our strength and abilities come from God. They prompt us to trust in His provision and guidance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XuvIkBLy-nM" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; How can we encourage disabled individuals to trust in God's strength and provision? How can we avoid underestimating their abilities or overemphasizing their disabilities?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;4. Weakness as a Means of Strength&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God often chooses the weak and broken things of this world to accomplish His purposes. The apostle Paul writes that God chose the foolish and weak things of the world to shame the wise and strong. By using the lowly and despised things, God nullifies human boasting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Recognizing that God can use disabilities as a means of demonstrating His power challenges societal norms and values. It reminds us that true strength comes from relying on God rather than relying solely on our physical or mental capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; How does society view disabilities, and how can we challenge those perceptions? How can we affirm the value and worth of disabled individuals as bearers of God's image?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;5. Jesus' Identification with Human Weakness&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Jesus came into the world, He voluntarily took on the limitations and vulnerabilities of humanity. He left the perfection of heaven to live among sinners on earth. Jesus experienced human frailty, empathizing with our weaknesses. He suffered on our behalf, ultimately demonstrating His love and sacrifice on the cross.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Understanding that Jesus willingly subjected Himself to weakness and suffering helps us find comfort and hope in His ability to empathize with our struggles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; How does Jesus' identification with human weakness impact your understanding of your own limitations? How can this knowledge deepen your relationship with Him?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;6. The Temporary Nature of Disabilities&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God promises that disabilities and handicaps are temporary in light of eternity. They are part of this fallen world, not the world to come. When Jesus came the first time, He healed the sick, opened blind eyes, unstopped deaf ears, and made the lame leap for joy. These miracles give us a glimpse of the future restoration when Jesus returns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Recognizing that disabilities are temporary encourages us to look forward to a future where all physical limitations will cease to exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; How can the hope of future restoration impact our perspective on disabilities in the present? How can we support disabled individuals by pointing them towards this future hope?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, while it may be challenging to understand why God allows disabilities and handicaps, we can trust that He has a purpose for each individual's circumstances. Disabilities remind us of the impact of sin in the world, provide opportunities for God's works and glory to be displayed, teach us to trust in Him, challenge societal norms, remind us of Jesus' identification with human weakness, and point us towards a future where disabilities will be no more. As we engage with disabled individuals, let us show compassion, support, and a recognition of their inherent value as bearers of God's image.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/God and Evil/Health Problems"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Divine Reflection: Unveiling the Truth About God's Nature</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/god-egomaniac/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-05-24T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-05-24T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-05-24:/god-egomaniac/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;God: Perfect and Worthy of Worship&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the Christian faith, God is seen as perfect and worthy of all praise and worship. Some may argue that God is an egomaniac due to His demand for worship and His jealousy. However, it is important to understand that God's perfection and authority justify His desire for worship. Let's explore this further:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Nature of Egomaniacs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An egomaniac is someone who is obsessively self-centered, often to the point of disregarding others. This kind of behavior is considered negative and unhealthy in humans because we have our own deficiencies and pathologies. However, this cannot be applied to God because He lacks any imperfections or deficiencies. Therefore, labeling God as an egomaniac would be inaccurate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Jesus' Statements on Love and Devotion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people point to passages like &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/10/Matthew-10-37.html"&gt;Matthew 10:37&lt;/a&gt;–39 where Jesus says, "Anyone who loves their father or mother more than me is not worthy of me; anyone who loves their son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me." These statements might seem egoistic if they were made by an ordinary person with a sinful nature. However, coming from the perfect Son of Man, God Incarnate, they are perfectly appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;God's Ownership and Right to Worship&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the Creator of the universe (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/1/Genesis-1-1.html"&gt;Genesis 1:1&lt;/a&gt;), God owns everything. He is all-powerful, perfect, and worthy of all praise. Therefore, it is justified for Him to demand our focus on worshiping Him, serving Him, and giving up everything to follow Him. The Great Commandment emphasizes this when it states, "‘Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.’ This is the first and greatest commandment" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/22/Matthew-22-37.html"&gt;Matthew 22:37&lt;/a&gt;–38).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;God's Love for Humanity&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In His "holy self-centeredness," God still shows love and care for others. He loved the world so much that He gave His one and only Son, Jesus, so that whoever believes in Him shall not perish but have eternal life (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/3/John-3-16.html"&gt;John 3:16&lt;/a&gt;). This act of sacrificial love demonstrates the greatest love possible. Jesus Himself lived a selfless life devoted to humbly helping others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;God's Perfection&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God is perfect in every way. His works are perfect (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Deuteronomy/32/Deuteronomy-32-4.html"&gt;Deuteronomy 32:4&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/2-Samuel/22/2-Samuel-22-31.html"&gt;2 Samuel 22:31&lt;/a&gt;), His knowledge is perfect (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Job/36/Job-36-4.html"&gt;Job 36:4&lt;/a&gt;, 37:16), His words are perfect (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/18/Psalm-18-30.html"&gt;Psalm 18:30&lt;/a&gt;), His laws are perfect (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/19/Psalm-19-7.html"&gt;Psalm 19:7&lt;/a&gt;), His beauty is perfect (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/50/Psalm-50-2.html"&gt;Psalm 50:2&lt;/a&gt;), His faithfulness is perfect (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/25/Isaiah-25-1.html"&gt;Isaiah 25:1&lt;/a&gt;), His will is perfect (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/12/Romans-12-2.html"&gt;Romans 12:2&lt;/a&gt;), and His love is perfect (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-John/4/1-John-4-18.html"&gt;1 John 4:18&lt;/a&gt;). There is no imperfection in Him or in any of His ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The True Egomaniacs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those who try to usurp God's authority or steal His glory by placing themselves above Him are the true egomaniacs. God alone is worthy of all praise and worship. As humans, we should recognize our rightful place as created beings and humbly submit to God's authority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the nature of God and our relationship with Him is crucial for our faith and spiritual growth. Recognizing God as the perfect and worthy object of our worship helps us align our lives with His will. This understanding can bring us closer to God, deepen our faith, and guide our actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Think About It&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reflect on your own understanding of God's perfection. How does it impact your view of Him and your relationship with Him?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consider the concept of worship. How does recognizing God's authority and worthiness shape your approach to worship?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have you ever struggled with placing something or someone above God in your life? How did it affect your relationship with Him, and how did you rectify it?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In what ways can you demonstrate selflessness and love for others, following the example set by Jesus?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember, God's desire for worship is not rooted in egomania but in His perfect nature and rightful authority. Embracing this truth can lead us to a deeper understanding of God's love and a more meaningful relationship with Him.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/God and Evil/God’s Character"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Does God Cause Suffering?

&lt;p&gt;Human suffering exists because sin exists. When Adam and Eve disobeyed God and ate from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, death and all the suffering it implies entered the world. Sin affected humanity's relationship with God, with each other, and with the animals. Sin also resulted in increased pain in childbearing, laborious toil in work, and contentiousness in human relationships. Ultimately, sin led to physical death. Sin opened the door for all kinds of suffering throughout creation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God, as the First Cause, is responsible for allowing suffering to exist. He created Adam and Eve knowing they would sin and the suffering that would result. However, God also made redemption possible through Jesus Christ. Jesus took on human flesh, experienced the suffering of a fallen world, was crucified without sin, and rose again, defeating sin and death. Those who put their faith in Jesus will be saved. Although God allows suffering, He does so for His good purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God is good, and everything He does is good. He can never be the author of evil. Suffering is a direct result of sin running rampant. We suffer due to our own sins, the sins of others, and the general fallen state of the world. Sometimes God directly causes suffering as a judgment against the wicked or as a call to repentance. Other times, God allows natural consequences of sin to play out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God also uses suffering to train His children and refine their faith. Suffering can produce a harvest of righteousness and peace for those who are trained by it. Whether suffering is caused intentionally by God or allowed into our lives, He uses it for our growth and good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suffering can also be a result of spiritual warfare or persecution. Satan and his demons have limited power in this world, and they may cause suffering. However, we can resist Satan and trust that God will restore and strengthen us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes the source and purpose of suffering are not immediately obvious. God may allow or cause suffering to bring about a greater good or to enlarge our view of Him. Suffering can also help us rely on God's grace and power. It is important to remember that God is in control, even in the midst of suffering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, suffering exists because sin exists. God allows suffering for His good purposes, whether as a result of our own sin, the sins of others, or the fallen state of the world. Sometimes God directly causes suffering, but He does so with a desire for people to repent and turn to Him. He also uses suffering to train His children and refine their faith. Suffering can be a result of spiritual warfare or persecution. Ultimately, God can take even the hardship of suffering and work it for His purposes. We can trust in Him and bring our struggles to Him, knowing that He cares for us and will walk with us through the suffering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding why suffering exists and how God relates to it is crucial for our faith. It helps us make sense of the pain and hardships we experience and provides hope in the midst of suffering. Knowing that God allows or causes suffering for His good purposes gives meaning to our struggles and encourages us to trust in His sovereignty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does knowing that sin is the root cause of suffering affect your understanding of why there is pain in the world?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In what ways have you experienced God using suffering in your life to refine your faith or draw you closer to Him?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does understanding that God is in control even in the midst of suffering impact your ability to trust Him?&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the Bible, God places immense value on human life. In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/1/Genesis-1-27.html"&gt;Genesis 1:27&lt;/a&gt;, we read that God created human beings in His own image, emphasizing the inherent worth and dignity of every person. This sentiment is echoed in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/9/Genesis-9-5.html"&gt;Genesis 9:5-6&lt;/a&gt;, where God …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;The Value of Human Life&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the Bible, God places immense value on human life. In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/1/Genesis-1-27.html"&gt;Genesis 1:27&lt;/a&gt;, we read that God created human beings in His own image, emphasizing the inherent worth and dignity of every person. This sentiment is echoed in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/9/Genesis-9-5.html"&gt;Genesis 9:5-6&lt;/a&gt;, where God tells Noah that He will demand an accounting for the life of another human being because they are made in His image. Furthermore, the Ten Commandments, given by God to His people in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Exodus/20/Exodus-20-1.html"&gt;Exodus 20:1-21&lt;/a&gt;, include the clear prohibition against murder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God's view on the sanctity of human life is reaffirmed throughout the New Testament as well. Verses such as &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/5/Matthew-5-21.html"&gt;Matthew 5:21&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/13/Romans-13-9.html"&gt;Romans 13:9&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-Timothy/1/1-Timothy-1-9.html"&gt;1 Timothy 1:9&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-John/3/1-John-3-15.html"&gt;1 John 3:15&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/James/2/James-2-11.html"&gt;James 2:11-12&lt;/a&gt; all emphasize the sacredness of human life. These passages make it clear that God values every human life and prohibits the intentional taking of a life without just cause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;God's Orders to Kill in the Old Testament&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, a question arises when considering the instances in which God ordered or carried out the killing of many people in the Old Testament. Examples include the Great Flood (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/6/Genesis-6-1.html"&gt;Genesis 6:1-8&lt;/a&gt;:22), the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/19/Genesis-19-1.html"&gt;Genesis 19:1-29&lt;/a&gt;), and the drowning of the Egyptian army at sea (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Exodus/14/Exodus-14-26.html"&gt;Exodus 14:26-31&lt;/a&gt;). In addition, God instructed Israel to execute everyone in Jericho except for Rahab and her family (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Joshua/6/Joshua-6-17.html"&gt;Joshua 6:17&lt;/a&gt;, 21).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This raises a valid concern: If God values human life so highly, why would He order or carry out such actions? The answer lies in understanding God's unique authority and role as both Creator and Judge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;God as Creator and Judge&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bible affirms that God is the Creator of the universe and the Author of life (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Acts/3/Acts-3-15.html"&gt;Acts 3:15&lt;/a&gt;). As such, He alone possesses the right and authority to give life and to take it away (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/2/Genesis-2-7.html"&gt;Genesis 2:7&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Job/1/Job-1-21.html"&gt;Job 1:21&lt;/a&gt;; 12:10; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Acts/3/Acts-3-15.html"&gt;Acts 3:15&lt;/a&gt;; 17:25). God is also the ultimate Judge of sin (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/13/Isaiah-13-11.html"&gt;Isaiah 13:11&lt;/a&gt;; 26:21; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/99/Psalm-99-8.html"&gt;Psalm 99:8&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Proverbs/11/Proverbs-11-21.html"&gt;Proverbs 11:21&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Amos/3/Amos-3-14.html"&gt;Amos 3:14&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Zephaniah/1/Zephaniah-1-12.html"&gt;Zephaniah 1:12&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/2/Romans-2-12.html"&gt;Romans 2:12&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-Thessalonians/4/1-Thessalonians-4-6.html"&gt;1 Thessalonians 4:6&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When individuals commit evil acts, God has the right and authority to carry out His punishment. Sometimes, the appropriate punishment for a crime is death (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/2/Genesis-2-17.html"&gt;Genesis 2:17&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Leviticus/20/Leviticus-20-1.html"&gt;Leviticus 20:1-17&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Proverbs/11/Proverbs-11-19.html"&gt;Proverbs 11:19&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/1/Romans-1-32.html"&gt;Romans 1:32&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-Corinthians/11/1-Corinthians-11-29.html"&gt;1 Corinthians 11:29-30&lt;/a&gt;). The Bible clearly states that "the wages of sin is death" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/6/Romans-6-23.html"&gt;Romans 6:23&lt;/a&gt;). In fact, God warned Adam and Eve that disobedience would result in death (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/2/Genesis-2-17.html"&gt;Genesis 2:17&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Divine Punishment and God's Sovereignty&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In several instances in the Old Testament, God's orders to kill or carry out destruction were acts of divine punishment. For example, the Great Flood was a consequence of widespread wickedness and corruption among humanity (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/6/Genesis-6-1.html"&gt;Genesis 6:1-4&lt;/a&gt;). The flood served as God's judgment on a sinful world, allowing Him to reassert His lordship and give humanity a fresh start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, in the case of Jericho, God used Israel as the means to carry out His punishment against a wicked nation. It is important to note that God specifically instructed Israel to execute everyone in Jericho except for Rahab and her family. The destruction of the Canaanites was not an act of genocide but a divine punishment for their detestable practices and idolatry (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Deuteronomy/12/Deuteronomy-12-29.html"&gt;Deuteronomy 12:29-13&lt;/a&gt;:18).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/taYhbRm6pnU" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Human Role in Carrying Out Justice&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the flood, God entrusted the task of carrying out His justice on earth to humans (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/13/Romans-13-4.html"&gt;Romans 13:4&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Jeremiah/51/Jeremiah-51-20.html"&gt;Jeremiah 51:20&lt;/a&gt;). This responsibility involves the administration of justice, including the imposition of capital punishment for crimes such as murder. However, it is crucial to understand that individuals are not authorized to independently carry out justice or seek revenge. God has reserved that authority for governing powers (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/13/Romans-13-1.html"&gt;Romans 13:1-14&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Mosaic Law, God prescribed the death penalty for various crimes, not just murder (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Exodus/22/Exodus-22-18.html"&gt;Exodus 22:18-20&lt;/a&gt;; 35:2; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Deuteronomy/21/Deuteronomy-21-18.html"&gt;Deuteronomy 21:18-21&lt;/a&gt;). While these regulations may seem harsh by today's standards, they served to maintain the purity and distinction of the Israelites from neighboring pagan nations. It is important to remember that these laws were fulfilled in Jesus Christ and are no longer binding legal obligations for Christians today (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/5/Matthew-5-17.html"&gt;Matthew 5:17&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/1/John-1-17.html"&gt;John 1:17&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/10/Romans-10-4.html"&gt;Romans 10:4&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding God's role as both Creator and Judge helps us grapple with difficult questions regarding His orders to kill in the Old Testament. It highlights the seriousness of sin and rebellion against God, as well as the importance of divine justice. Recognizing these truths can deepen our understanding of God's character and His sovereignty over all creation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Think About It&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does the belief in God's authority as Creator and Judge affect your understanding of His orders to kill in the Old Testament?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can we reconcile God's commandments against murder with His orders to carry out capital punishment in certain instances?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What does it mean for Christians today that Jesus fulfilled the law and that we are no longer under the legalistic obligations of Mosaic Law?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can we apply the principles of valuing human life and upholding justice in our own lives and society today?&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When God created the world, He declared it to be good (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/1/Genesis-1-31.html"&gt;Genesis 1:31&lt;/a&gt;).

&lt;p&gt;When God created the world, He declared it to be good (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/1/Genesis-1-31.html"&gt;Genesis 1:31&lt;/a&gt;). In this perfect creation, there was no sin, disease, crime, or suffering. Mosquitoes were also part of this original creation, but they were vegetarian creatures that did not bite humans or animals for blood. The need for mosquitoes to prey on humans and animals arose after the Fall and the subsequent curse that affected the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mosquitoes have become vectors for various diseases, such as malaria, yellow fever, dengue fever, encephalitis, zika, and many others. These diseases are spread through mosquito bites. However, not all mosquitoes bite people and animals; only certain female mosquitoes require blood to aid in their egg production. All mosquitoes feed on plant nectar, and some species feed exclusively on plant juices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before the Fall, mosquitoes did not rely on blood for survival. It is believed that female mosquitoes obtained nutrients from plant nectar or other non-animal sources of protein. Many creation scientists suggest that the mosquitoes that require blood are the result of post-Fall mutations caused by the impact of sin on the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fsm3Hbh8JQY" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is important to note that mosquitoes play a significant role in various ecosystems. They serve as a food source for fish and migratory birds and act as pollinators for plants with small flowers. The potential eradication of mosquitoes could have unforeseen consequences on the ecosystem. While eliminating mosquito-borne diseases would be beneficial, it may also lead to a loss of some pollinators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The discomfort and diseases caused by mosquitoes are a result of the fallen state of creation. When humanity rebelled against God, the entire world was affected by decay and suffering. However, the good news is that Jesus will return one day to liberate creation from its bondage and restore it to its original glory (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/8/Romans-8-18.html"&gt;Romans 8:18-21&lt;/a&gt;). In this renewed creation, there will be no hunger, disease, or blood-sucking mosquitoes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding why God created mosquitoes can help us appreciate the complexity and balance of the natural world. It reminds us that even though we live in a fallen world, God's original creation was perfect and harmonious. It also highlights the consequences of sin and rebellion against God, which brought about suffering and decay. Recognizing the role mosquitoes play in ecosystems can lead to a better understanding of God's design and the interdependence of living organisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does the existence of mosquitoes challenge your understanding of a good and perfect creation?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can you think of any other examples in nature where seemingly negative aspects serve a purpose or contribute to the overall balance of ecosystems?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reflect on the hope found in the promise of Jesus' return and the restoration of creation. How does this perspective shape your understanding of present suffering?&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question of why the wicked prosper is one that has troubled believers throughout history. Even the prophet Jeremiah asked God why the way of the wicked prospers, and Job wondered why the wicked live on and increase in power. The psalmist expressed envy when he saw the prosperity of the wicked, questioning if living righteously was worth the trouble. So, why does it seem like evil people often thrive while the righteous suffer? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One possible reason for this perception is our own temptation to envy the wicked. As God's children, we may be upset when we see an evil person doing well because we feel they have something we do not. However, it's important to remember that the prosperity of the wicked is temporary. In Psalm 37, we are reminded not to fret or be envious of those who do wrong because their prosperity will soon wither away. Trusting in the Lord and doing good will lead to a righteous reward that far surpasses any temporary success enjoyed by the wicked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is also natural to wonder why God shows grace and mercy to people who do not deserve it. We may desire appropriate consequences for bad behavior and struggle to forgive our enemies. However, we should remember that many of us were once hard-hearted and stubborn ourselves, deserving of God's judgment. But God extended His love and grace towards us so that we might receive salvation. It is through His rich mercy and love that we have been saved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/k8M4vWkeqfA" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another answer to the question "Why do the wicked prosper?" lies in understanding that even the wicked have a purpose to fulfill in God's plan. Throughout history, God has raised up various nations and leaders, including ruthless and impetuous ones, to accomplish His purposes. He used Babylon to judge disobedient Judah, raised up Cyrus for His pleasure, and employed Egyptians and Assyrians in His righteous judgment. The wicked may prosper for a time, but ultimately, God's sovereign plan will prevail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most important reason why the wicked prosper is because of God's love for sinners. &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/3/John-3-16.html"&gt;John 3:16&lt;/a&gt; tells us that God loves the world so much that He gave His only Son to save us. He is patient, compassionate, and merciful towards the wicked because He desires their salvation. God's patience with the wicked provides an opportunity for them to repent and turn towards Him. Second Peter 3:9 reassures us that the Lord is not slow in keeping His promise but is patient because He wants everyone to come to repentance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although we may desire immediate judgment for the wicked, we must trust in God's sovereign plan and His desire for all people to be saved. His patience with the wicked is an opportunity for us to pray for them and share the message of salvation. We are called to tell the wicked about God's wonderful salvation and warn them of the consequences if they remain hardened in their ways. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding why the wicked prosper is crucial for believers who may feel discouraged or envious when they see evil people thriving. It helps us maintain our trust in God's justice and sovereignty, knowing that their prosperity is temporary and that God has a purpose even for the wicked. Recognizing that God loves sinners and desires their salvation should also encourage us to pray for them and share the message of redemption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Think About It&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you ever felt discouraged or envious when you saw evil people prospering? How does understanding that their prosperity is temporary and that God has a plan for them affect your perspective?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reflect on a time when you experienced God's love and grace despite your own sinful nature. How does this influence your willingness to extend forgiveness and grace to others?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider how you can actively pray for and witness to those who may be considered "wicked" in society. How can you demonstrate God's love and share the message of salvation with them?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sin is a concept that has been debated and discussed for centuries. Many people wonder if God created sin, or if it is an inherent part of human nature. In order to answer this question, we must first define what sin is. According to the Bible, sin is any violation of God's holy law (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-John/3/1-John-3-4.html"&gt;1 John 3:4&lt;/a&gt;). It is anything that falls short of God's glory and perfection (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/3/Romans-3-23.html"&gt;Romans 3:23&lt;/a&gt;). With this understanding in mind, we can explore the origin of sin and its implications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Perfection of God's Creation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When God created the universe, everything He made was "very good" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/1/Genesis-1-31.html"&gt;Genesis 1:31&lt;/a&gt;). The universe had no sin in its original state. Sin entered the cosmos due to an act of rebellion against God, not because God created sin. It is important to note that sin is a deviation from God's perfect standards, and it was not a part of His original design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Definition of Sin&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to understand sin, we need to have a clear definition. Sin is any violation of God's holy law. It encompasses our words, thoughts, actions, and motivations. &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/3/Romans-3-23.html"&gt;Romans 3:23&lt;/a&gt; tells us that all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God. This means that everyone, without exception, has committed acts that go against God's perfect standard. In order to accurately define sin, we must know the character of God, as His glory serves as the standard by which we measure it. Without this standard, every word or action would be judged by the faulty and shifting standards of imperfect people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Risk of Free Will&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God created human beings with a free will, which means that they have the ability to choose between right and wrong. This freedom of choice carries with it the risk that individuals may choose badly. Sin is a consequence of this freedom. Just as a builder who builds on an imperfect foundation risks compromising the integrity of the entire structure, human beings, when they deviate from God's moral standard, move further away from what is right. The potential for sin was a risk that God took when He created beings with free will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Choice of Adam and Eve&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Garden of Eden, God gave Adam and Eve a true choice. He communicated His moral standard to them and allowed them to exercise their free will. Adam chose disobedience, and as a result, sin entered the world (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/2/Genesis-2-16.html"&gt;Genesis 2:16-17&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/5/Romans-5-12.html"&gt;Romans 5:12&lt;/a&gt;). It is important to note that God did not tempt, coerce, or lure Adam into disobedience. &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/James/1/James-1-13.html"&gt;James 1:13&lt;/a&gt; tells us that God cannot be tempted by evil, nor does He tempt anyone. God allowed Adam the dignity of free choice and honored that choice with appropriate consequences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Consequences of Sin&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every human being since Adam and Eve has been faced with the opportunity to sin. Sin is inherent in our freedom of choice. We can choose to seek God and follow His ways, which lead to righteous living, or we can choose to follow our own inclinations, which lead us away from God. The Bible is clear that whatever path we choose, there are consequences. &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Galatians/6/Galatians-6-7.html"&gt;Galatians 6:7&lt;/a&gt; tells us that we reap what we sow. Some consequences are temporal, while others have eternal implications (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/25/Matthew-25-46.html"&gt;Matthew 25:46&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ujxeWX6enYA" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;God's Desire for Repentance&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although sin entered the world through human disobedience, God does not delight in punishing those who choose to sin (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Ezekiel/33/Ezekiel-33-11.html"&gt;Ezekiel 33:11&lt;/a&gt;). His desire is for all people to come to repentance and experience the blessings and joy of eternal life with Him (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/2-Peter/3/2-Peter-3-9.html"&gt;2 Peter 3:9&lt;/a&gt;). God calls us to follow Him, promising us blessings, fellowship, and protection when we obey (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Jeremiah/7/Jeremiah-7-23.html"&gt;Jeremiah 7:23&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/115/Psalm-115-11.html"&gt;Psalm 115:11&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/11/Luke-11-28.html"&gt;Luke 11:28&lt;/a&gt;). However, He does not force us to choose Him. He allows us to exercise our free will and make our own decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the origin of sin is crucial because it helps us grasp the magnitude of God's love and grace. Sin is a result of human rebellion, not something that God created. It reminds us of the significance of our choices and the consequences they carry. Recognizing this truth enables us to appreciate God's redemptive plan and the sacrifice of Jesus Christ on the cross. It also highlights the importance of repentance and turning away from sin, as we strive to align our lives with God's perfect standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider the implications of a world without free will. If human beings were merely puppets, programmed to always do what is right, would there be any meaning or purpose in our choices? Would there be room for genuine love, obedience, or growth? The existence of sin, although undesirable, allows for the possibility of authentic relationships with God and others. It also highlights the need for humility and dependence on God's grace, as we acknowledge our propensity to choose badly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, sin is not something that God created but rather a consequence of human rebellion against His perfect standards. God created human beings with free will, allowing for the possibility of choosing disobedience. Sin entered the world through Adam and Eve's choice to go against God's command. However, God's desire is for all people to repent and experience His blessings. Understanding the origin of sin helps us appreciate God's love, grace, and redemptive plan, while reminding us of the significance of our choices and the need for repentance.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/God and Evil/The Existence of Sin and Evil"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Unveiling the Truth: Is God a Moral Monster?

&lt;p&gt;When discussing the character of God, some people argue that He is a moral monster. They claim that God is hypocritical, selfish, arrogant, judgmental, hateful, and even homicidal. However, it is important to approach these claims with a comprehensive understanding of the Bible and its …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;God: Moral Monster or Just?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When discussing the character of God, some people argue that He is a moral monster. They claim that God is hypocritical, selfish, arrogant, judgmental, hateful, and even homicidal. However, it is important to approach these claims with a comprehensive understanding of the Bible and its teachings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Standard of Morality&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One problem with labeling God as immoral is that it requires a standard of morality separate from God. In order to claim that "God is morally wrong," one must define morality in a way that justifies this accusation. However, without God, there can be no truly objective morality. Concepts like suffering or human flourishing are subjective and lack a rational basis for moral reasoning. Thus, meaningful moral claims require the existence of God as the ultimate source of morality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Understanding that God is the foundation of moral principles helps us make sense of His actions and commands. It challenges us to question our own assumptions about morality and seek a deeper understanding of God's character.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; If morality is subjective and based on human opinion, how can we determine what is truly good or evil? How does this impact our understanding of justice and ethics?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Problem of Evil&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another common objection is that God allows evil to exist, making Him morally questionable. However, this argument overlooks the existence of free will and the role it plays in human choices. While God allows evil to occur, He does not directly cause it. Evil arises from the misuse of free will by humans who choose to act against God's will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Recognizing that evil is a result of human choices helps us understand the consequences of our actions and the importance of using our free will responsibly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; If God were to intervene and prevent every act of evil, would we still have true freedom? What would be the consequences of living in a world without free will?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Divine Commands and Justice&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some accuse God of being arrogant, selfish, or egomaniacal because He demands worship, punishes those who disobey Him, and condemns those who insult Him. However, these claims fail to consider the context of God's commands and His love for humanity. Just as good parents set rules for their children's well-being, God establishes guidelines for our benefit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Understanding God's expectations helps us recognize His love and desire for our best interests. It challenges us to trust in His wisdom and guidance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; How does God's authority and desire for obedience reflect His love for us? How can we reconcile His demand for worship with His loving nature?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Old Testament Wars&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Critics often point to the wars described in the Old Testament as evidence of God's immorality. However, it is important to consider the historical and scriptural context of these events. When God commanded war against the Canaanites, for example, it was in response to their long-standing evil practices and warnings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1C3q3Zr_R8E" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Understanding the context of God's commands helps us see His justice and the importance of upholding moral standards. It challenges us to question our own moral judgments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; How does the historical context of the Old Testament wars impact our understanding of God's actions? What can we learn from these events about the consequences of evil?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Problem of Good&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Critics often argue that if God created everything, including evil, then He is responsible for both good and evil. However, this overlooks the distinction between what God allows and what He directly causes. Evil arises from human choices, while goodness flows from God's nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Recognizing that God is not the author of evil helps us understand His goodness and His desire to bring about a world without evil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; How does the existence of evil challenge our understanding of God's goodness and sovereignty? What role do human choices play in the presence of evil?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Promise of Redemption&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the presence of evil in the world, God has not remained idle. He has provided a plan to end all evil and suffering through the person of Jesus Christ. While this plan is not yet fully realized, everything is in motion toward that ultimate goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Understanding God's plan for redemption gives us hope in the face of evil and suffering. It challenges us to seek a deeper relationship with Him and trust in His ultimate victory over evil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; How does the promise of redemption shape our perspective on the problem of evil? How can we find hope and comfort in God's plan for ultimate restoration?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, labeling God as a moral monster requires a standard of morality separate from God, which is ultimately flawed. Recognizing that evil arises from human choices and understanding the context of God's commands helps us make sense of His actions. Moreover, acknowledging that God is not the author of evil but offers a plan for redemption gives us hope and reassurance. Ultimately, engaging with these questions leads us to a deeper understanding of God's character and challenges our own moral assumptions.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/God and Evil/God’s Character"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Why Does God Allow Evil? Understanding the Divine Purpose</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/god-allow-evil/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-05-11T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-05-11T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-05-11:/god-allow-evil/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Why Does God Allow Evil?&lt;/h2&gt;

These attributes tell us that God is capable of preventing evil and desires to rid the universe of evil …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Why Does God Allow Evil?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question of why God allows evil is one that has puzzled believers and skeptics alike. The Bible describes God as holy, righteous, just, and sovereign. These attributes tell us that God is capable of preventing evil and desires to rid the universe of evil. So, if both of these statements are true, why does God allow evil to exist?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Problem of Free Will&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One way to understand why God allows evil is to consider the alternative ways in which He could have created the world. For example, God could have chosen to change everyone's personality so that they cannot sin. However, this would also mean that we would not have free will. We would not be able to choose between right and wrong because we would be programmed to only do what is right. While this may eliminate evil, it would also eliminate meaningful relationships between God and His creation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, God made Adam and Eve innocent with the ability to choose good or evil. They could respond to His love and trust Him or choose to disobey. Unfortunately, they chose to disobey, and their sin affected all of humanity. Our decisions to sin also have consequences on ourselves and those around us. This is a result of living in a world where we can choose our actions but not their consequences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Limitations of Supernatural Intervention&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another alternative way in which God could have dealt with evil is by compensating for people's evil actions through supernatural intervention 100 percent of the time. In this scenario, God would stop any drunk driver from causing an accident, prevent lazy construction workers from doing substandard jobs, stop fathers addicted to drugs or alcohol from harming their families, prevent thieves from stealing, and intervene in countless other situations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XBIXPr6AH4A" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this solution may sound attractive, it would lose its appeal when God's intervention infringes on something we want to do. We may want God to prevent horribly evil actions, but we are often willing to let "lesser-evil" actions slide. What we fail to realize is that these "lesser-evil" actions often lead to greater evil. For example, should God only stop actual sexual affairs or should He also prevent access to pornography or end inappropriate relationships? Should God only stop murder or should He also prevent the "lesser-evil" actions that lead to murder? The line between what God should and shouldn't intervene in becomes blurred.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Consequences of Judgment&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A third option would be for God to judge and remove those who choose to commit evil acts. However, if God were to do this, there would be no one left. We all sin and commit evil acts to some extent. While some people may be more evil than others, all evil causes harm to others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of these alternatives, God chose to create a "real" world where choices have consequences. Our actions in this world have direct and indirect effects on ourselves and those around us. As a result of Adam's choice to sin, the world now lives under a curse, and we are all born with a sin nature. However, God has not abandoned us to our sinful state. He is delaying judgment in order to give people more time to repent and turn to Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;God's Concern for Evil&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout history, God has shown His concern for evil. In the Old Testament, when He gave the Law, one of His goals was to discourage and punish evil. He has judged nations and rulers who disregard justice and pursue evil. In the New Testament, God states that it is the government's responsibility to provide justice and protect the innocent from evil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God promises severe consequences for those who commit evil acts, especially against the innocent. He cares about justice and righteousness. However, it is important to note that God does not prevent all evil from occurring. This is because we live in a world where our choices have consequences, and God allows us to experience the results of our actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Cure for Evil&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of blaming God for not preventing all evil, we should focus on the cure for evil and its consequences. Jesus came to change people's hearts through the power of the Holy Spirit. He offers salvation to those who turn from evil and call on Him to save them from sin and its consequences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, God allows evil to exist because He desires a world where choices have consequences. While He has the power to prevent evil, He also values our free will and the opportunity for us to choose Him. God cares about justice and righteousness, and He promises severe consequences for those who commit evil acts. Instead of questioning God on why He does not prevent all evil, we should focus on proclaiming the cure for evil—Jesus Christ.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/God and Evil/The Existence of Sin and Evil"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Can God Lie?

&lt;h3&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God is holy, which means He is morally perfect and has absolute integrity. His holiness sets Him apart from all His creatures and makes it impossible for Him to lie. Lying goes against His nature. Because God cannot lie, His word, the Bible, is completely trustworthy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;God's Unchanging Nature&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basis of God's promise to Abraham in Genesis 12 was His unchanging nature. God's rock-solid attribute of truth makes everything He says utterly trustworthy. It is impossible for God to lie. If God could lie, He would not be transcendent; He would be just like us, humans who have a reputation for hiding, misrepresenting, and distorting the truth. But "God is not a man, that he should lie, nor a son of man, that he should change his mind." &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Reward of Faith&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the very beginning, God has rewarded faith in Him. Faith can only be a good thing if its object is worthy of trust. If God could lie, then His words would be suspect, and He would be unworthy of our trust. But as it is, He is wholly dependable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Jesus: The Truth Incarnate&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus, who is "in very nature God," is "full of grace and truth." Everything Jesus said and taught was the absolute truth. Jesus cannot lie because God cannot lie. Jesus came "to testify to the truth." He is the Truth itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4pKoCVZwfE4" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Honesty in God's Children&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God wants moral purity in His children as well. Just as God cannot lie, followers of Christ should not lie. Each person must put off falsehood and speak truthfully to their neighbor. May we love the truth as God does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding that God cannot lie is crucial for our faith and trust in Him. It assures us that His promises are reliable and His word is trustworthy. Knowing that God is wholly dependable gives us confidence in seeking Him, following Him, and living according to His truth. It also encourages us to cultivate honesty and integrity in our own lives, reflecting the character of our holy God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Think About It&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does knowing that God cannot lie impact your trust in Him?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are some practical ways you can strive to speak truthfully and cultivate honesty in your own life?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reflect on a time when someone's lie caused harm or mistrust. How does God's inability to lie contrast with this experience?&lt;/li&gt;

However, it is crucial to understand that allowing something …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Sickness and the Sovereignty of God&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept of sickness and its relationship to the sovereignty of God is an important aspect of Christian theology. The Bible teaches that God is almighty and in complete control of all things, including sickness. However, it is crucial to understand that allowing something to happen and causing something to happen are two different things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we look at the origins of sickness, we can trace it back to the fall of humanity into sin. When Adam and Eve rebelled against God, they brought about all manner of evil, including sickness. Sickness is a manifestation of natural evil, which includes things like natural disasters and physical illnesses. It is a state where good health is missing, a corruption or perversion of the originally good and healthy state of being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While God did not directly cause Adam and Eve to sin, He allowed their rebellion for His own purposes and to bring about His perfect plan. Evil is not caused by God but allowed by Him to exist. The Greek word for evil, ponerous, implies a malignancy that corrupts a good and healthy state of being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Consequences of Sin&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The consequences of Adam's sin affected all of humanity, including the introduction of sickness into the world. In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/8/Romans-8-20.html"&gt;Romans 8:20-22&lt;/a&gt;, it states that creation was subjected to frustration following the fall, not by its own choice but by the will of God. This frustration includes sickness and decay. However, there is hope as creation longs for liberation from its bondage to sin and awaits the glorious freedom that comes through Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to note that until that day of liberation comes, God uses sickness and other forms of evil to fulfill His sovereign purposes, bring glory to Himself, and exalt His holy name. Sometimes, He miraculously heals sickness as we see in the ministry of Jesus who went through Israel healing various illnesses and even raising the dead. Other times, God uses sickness as a form of discipline or judgment against sin, as demonstrated in the cases of King Uzziah and Nebuchadnezzar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Role of Sickness in God's Plan&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MGMRuIVGSNc" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While sickness can be a consequence of our fallen world, our bodies, and poor health choices, it is important to remember that all sickness and disease are allowed by God for His purposes. We may not always understand these purposes, but God is in control. He determines the boundaries of evil, just as He did with Satan in the book of Job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 3 John 2, we see an indication that God desires His people to be in good health. However, even believers may experience sickness and suffering in this life. It is through their suffering that they can glorify God, even if they do not fully understand why He has allowed it. In eternity, when we stand in His presence, all questions will be answered or perhaps become irrelevant as we bask in His glory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the relationship between sickness and the sovereignty of God is essential for our faith. It helps us navigate the challenges of life and suffering. Knowing that God is in control and has a plan even in the midst of sickness gives us hope and comfort. It also reminds us that our ultimate healing comes through Christ and the liberation from sin that He offers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Think About It&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does understanding the sovereignty of God impact your perspective on sickness and suffering?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can we find comfort and hope in knowing that God is in control even in the midst of sickness?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reflect on instances where you have seen God work through sickness or suffering to bring about His purposes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does the concept of God allowing sickness challenge our understanding of His goodness?&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hunger and malnutrition are significant problems in our world, affecting millions of children. It is crucial to address the issue of starving children from a Christian perspective, acknowledging God's love and humanity's responsibility. In this article, we will explore the reasons behind the prevalence of hunger, discuss God's care for children, and understand how we can actively work towards alleviating this crisis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Reality of Starving Children&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Millions of children suffer from malnourishment and die each year due to lack of adequate food. In developing countries, approximately 25 percent of children are underweight and at risk of long-term health consequences. These statistics highlight the urgent need to address the issue of hunger among children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;God's Love for Children&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bible teaches us that children hold immense value in the eyes of God. In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/18/Matthew-18-5.html"&gt;Matthew 18:5-6&lt;/a&gt;, Jesus emphasizes the significance of receiving and caring for children: "Whoever receives one such child in my name receives me." Furthermore, Jesus reminds us that these little ones have angels who see the face of God in heaven (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/18/Matthew-18-10.html"&gt;Matthew 18:10&lt;/a&gt;). This highlights God's deep care and concern for children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Problem of Accessibility&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there is enough food in the world to feed everyone, the issue lies in accessibility rather than scarcity. Corrupt systems, mismanagement of resources, hoarding, and selfishness prevent adequate distribution of food to those in need. Instead of being responsible stewards of our resources, humans often prioritize personal gain over meeting the needs of others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Human Responsibility&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is crucial to recognize that God is not responsible for the sins and failings of humanity. Greed, selfishness, pride, and other sinful behaviors contribute to world hunger. The Bible affirms that all people are sinners (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/3/Romans-3-23.html"&gt;Romans 3:23&lt;/a&gt;), and sin leads to death (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/6/Romans-6-23.html"&gt;Romans 6:23&lt;/a&gt;). Tragedies such as world hunger are a result of sin's impact on the fallen state of humanity (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/8/Romans-8-22.html"&gt;Romans 8:22&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;God's Care in Action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God demonstrates His care for children through His redemptive plan. He sent His Son, Jesus Christ, into the world to save us from the consequences of sin (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-John/4/1-John-4-9.html"&gt;1 John 4:9&lt;/a&gt;). Additionally, God prompts followers of Christ to actively participate in alleviating hunger. Numerous Christian organizations, such as Compassion International and Samaritan's Purse, work tirelessly to provide food and other essential needs to hungry children worldwide. These efforts embody God's love and compassion for His creation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hit-5AftoT0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The Purpose of Christian Missionaries&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christian missionaries play a vital role in addressing the basic needs of people while sharing the message of God's Word. They exemplify the love of Christ and fulfill their purpose as God's handiwork, created to do good works (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Ephesians/2/Ephesians-2-10.html"&gt;Ephesians 2:10&lt;/a&gt;). By serving those in need, missionaries not only provide immediate relief but also offer hope and spiritual nourishment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Finding Hope in God's Goodness&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The existence of evil and suffering in the world can be discouraging. However, it is important to remember that evil originates from Satan, sin, and the fallen nature of humanity. God remains good throughout these challenges. We must continue to resist evil (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Ephesians/6/Ephesians-6-13.html"&gt;Ephesians 6:13&lt;/a&gt;) and love our neighbors as ourselves (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/3/John-3-16.html"&gt;John 3:16&lt;/a&gt;) for the sake of Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding God's care for starving children is crucial for cultivating compassion and taking action. It reminds us that we are called to be stewards of the resources entrusted to us and to actively work towards ending hunger. By aligning ourselves with God's heart for children, we can make a positive impact on their lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reflect on the statistics regarding starving children. How does this information impact your understanding of the issue?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consider the role of Christian missionaries in addressing world hunger. How can you support their efforts?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does knowing that God cares for children motivate you to take action in combating hunger?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, understanding the prevalence of starving children requires us to acknowledge God's love and humanity's responsibility. By actively engaging in efforts to combat hunger and supporting organizations dedicated to this cause, we can demonstrate God's love and work towards a world where no child goes hungry.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/God and Evil/Hardships"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Protecting God's Gift: Understanding and Overcoming Birth Defects</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/birth-defects/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-04-27T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-04-27T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-04-27:/birth-defects/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Birth Defects: Understanding the Impact of Sin&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Birth defects are a heartbreaking reality that affects countless individuals and families around the world. These conditions, ranging from structural abnormalities to functional impairments, can have a significant impact on the lives of those born with them. As Christians seeking understanding in the face of such challenges, we turn to the Bible for guidance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Origin of Birth Defects&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The root cause of birth defects can be traced back to the entrance of sin into the world. In the book of Genesis, we learn that when Adam and Eve chose to disobey God, they ushered in a fallen state of existence (Genesis 3). This act not only brought spiritual separation from God but also unleashed a host of physical consequences, including sickness, disease, and death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Birth defects occur as a result of this brokenness in our world, not because of any specific sins committed by parents or babies. It is crucial to understand that birth defects are not punishments for personal wrongdoing. Instead, they are a consequence of sin's pervasive influence on creation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Wrestling with God's Allowance&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One may wonder why God permits birth defects to occur if He is both loving and powerful. The book of Job offers insights into this complex question. In this narrative, God allows Satan to afflict Job and test his faithfulness. Despite enduring immense suffering and loss, Job maintains his trust in God, acknowledging His sovereignty (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Job/13/Job-13-15.html"&gt;Job 13:15&lt;/a&gt;; 1:21).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As humans, we may not always comprehend why God allows certain things to happen. Rather than doubting God's goodness, our response should mirror Job's unwavering trust in Him. We must remember that God is good, just, loving, and merciful, even when circumstances seem contrary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/g6YtUcCQ9c4" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Trusting in God's Wisdom&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we may never fully understand God and His ways, our role is to trust Him wholeheartedly. The Bible encourages us to "Trust in the LORD with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding; in all your ways acknowledge Him, and He will make your paths straight" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Proverbs/3/Proverbs-3-5.html"&gt;Proverbs 3:5-6&lt;/a&gt;). Trusting God means recognizing His unlimited wisdom and submitting ourselves to His plan, even when it is difficult to comprehend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our search for answers, we must remember that sickness, disease, and birth defects are the consequence of sin's presence in our world. However, God has provided a solution for sin through the sacrifice of Jesus Christ (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/5/Romans-5-8.html"&gt;Romans 5:8&lt;/a&gt;). When we enter into a personal relationship with Christ, we can have hope that one day, in heaven, we will be free from these afflictions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;God's Purposes in Suffering&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is natural to question why suffering exists and why God allows it. However, Scripture assures us that God can use even birth defects and other tragedies for our ultimate good and His glory. In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/9/John-9-2.html"&gt;John 9:2-3&lt;/a&gt;, Jesus encounters a man who was born blind. When asked whether the man or his parents were responsible for his condition, Jesus responds, "Neither this man nor his parents sinned... but this happened so that the work of God might be displayed in his life."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This passage reveals that God can bring purpose out of suffering by glorifying Himself through our circumstances. While we may not understand the specifics of how this works, we can trust that God has a greater plan beyond our comprehension.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept of birth defects and their origin matters because it touches upon profound questions about the nature of suffering and God's role in our lives. Understanding that birth defects are a consequence of sin can help us navigate these difficult realities with greater compassion and empathy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recognizing that no one is to blame for birth defects can alleviate feelings of guilt or shame often experienced by parents. It reminds us that our fallen world extends grace to those affected by these conditions, rather than pointing fingers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How does understanding that birth defects are a result of sin impact your perception of individuals born with these conditions?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reflect on times when you have questioned God's allowance of suffering or difficult circumstances. How can the story of Job inspire you to trust God's goodness despite not fully understanding His ways?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In what ways can we demonstrate compassion and support for individuals and families affected by birth defects?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, birth defects are a tragic consequence of sin's entrance into the world. While we may struggle to understand why God allows them, our response should be one of trust in His infinite wisdom and goodness. Through faith, we can find hope in Christ and rest in the assurance that God can use all circumstances, including birth defects, for our ultimate good and His glory.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/God and Evil/Health Problems"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Does God Make Mistakes? Understanding Divine Perfection in Christianity</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/does-god-make-mistakes/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-04-26T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-04-26T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-04-26:/does-god-make-mistakes/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Does God Make Mistakes?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept of whether or not God makes mistakes is an important question for many individuals seeking to understand the nature and character of God. According to the Bible, God is depicted as perfect, infallible, and all-knowing. As such, it can be concluded that God does …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Does God Make Mistakes?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept of whether or not God makes mistakes is an important question for many individuals seeking to understand the nature and character of God. According to the Bible, God is depicted as perfect, infallible, and all-knowing. As such, it can be concluded that God does not make mistakes. This perspective is supported by several biblical passages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;God's Perfection and Greatness&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bible describes God as being "great and most worthy of praise; his greatness no one can fathom" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/145/Psalm-145-3.html"&gt;Psalm 145:3&lt;/a&gt;). This verse emphasizes that God's greatness is infinite and beyond human comprehension. If God were capable of making mistakes, it would imply a limitation in His greatness. However, the Bible affirms that God's perfection disallows any mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the Bible states that God's understanding has no limit (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/147/Psalm-147-5.html"&gt;Psalm 147:5&lt;/a&gt;). Unlike humans, who are prone to making mistakes due to limited knowledge, God possesses unlimited knowledge and therefore does not make mistakes. His ability to comprehend all matters ensures that He always acts with wisdom and precision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;God's Creation of the World&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God's creation of the world provides further evidence that He does not make mistakes. After six days of creation, God surveyed all He had made and pronounced it "very good" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/1/Genesis-1-31.html"&gt;Genesis 1:31&lt;/a&gt;). There were no exceptions or disappointments in God's assessment of His creation. This demonstrates that God's infinite wisdom, power, and goodness combined to produce a perfect world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the presence of sin in the world, which might be seen as evidence of a mistake, it is important to note that God's actions are intentional and purposeful. In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Numbers/23/Numbers-23-19.html"&gt;Numbers 23:19&lt;/a&gt;, it is stated that God is not human and does not lie or change His mind. This means that He does not make decrees that He later annuls due to unforeseen consequences or a lack of power to fulfill them. God's righteousness and faithfulness ensure that He makes no mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;God's Regret in the Flood Narrative&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One passage that may seem to suggest that God made a mistake is the story of the flood in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/6/Genesis-6-5.html"&gt;Genesis 6:5-7&lt;/a&gt;. It describes how God saw the wickedness of humanity and regretted making them. However, it is important to understand the meaning of the word "regret" in this context. When used of God, regret incorporates the thought of compassionate grief and an action taken. In this instance, God was not admitting an error or regretting a mistake but expressing His need to take drastic action to counteract the overwhelming wickedness of mankind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact that God did not consider His creation a mistake is evident by the world's continued existence. Despite human sinfulness, we are still here. This highlights God's grace, which increases alongside sin (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/5/Romans-5-20.html"&gt;Romans 5:20&lt;/a&gt;). Noah also found grace in the eyes of the Lord (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/6/Genesis-6-8.html"&gt;Genesis 6:8&lt;/a&gt;). Therefore, it can be concluded that God's actions leading up to the flood were purposeful and not indicative of a mistake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Trusting in God's Purpose&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2IN0a-MPGGI" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While individuals may perceive certain experiences or conditions in their lives as mistakes, it is essential to remember that God works for the good of those who love Him (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/8/Romans-8-28.html"&gt;Romans 8:28&lt;/a&gt;). This requires faith and trust in His plan, even when it is difficult to understand. As believers, we live by faith and not solely by what we see (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/2-Corinthians/5/2-Corinthians-5-7.html"&gt;2 Corinthians 5:7&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is crucial to recognize that our earthly lives are temporary, and God's purpose extends beyond this present world. The things we experience are expendable and contribute to our eternal reward according to God's wisdom (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Jude/1/Jude-1-24.html"&gt;Jude 1:24&lt;/a&gt;). We can find comfort in knowing that our infallible God has a good and loving purpose for everything He allows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Jesus: The Spotless Lamb of God&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The perfection of God is also reflected in Jesus Christ, who committed no sin in thought, word, or deed (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/4/Hebrews-4-15.html"&gt;Hebrews 4:15&lt;/a&gt;). Even Satan's attempts to find fault in Jesus were unsuccessful (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/4/Matthew-4-1.html"&gt;Matthew 4:1-11&lt;/a&gt;). At the end of Jesus' life, Pontius Pilate, His earthly judge, declared, "I find no fault in this man" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/23/Luke-23-4.html"&gt;Luke 23:4&lt;/a&gt;). This further confirms the idea that God does not make mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding that God does not make mistakes provides us with a sense of security and assurance. It reminds us that God's plans and actions are perfect and intentional. This knowledge allows us to trust Him completely and find comfort in His sovereignty, even when we face difficulties or uncertainties in life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider how your understanding of God's infallibility influences your trust in His plans and purposes for your life.

Discover the Truth</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/god-heal-amputees/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-04-25T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-04-25T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-04-25:/god-heal-amputees/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;God's Healing and Amputees&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question of why God does not heal amputees is often used as an argument against the existence of God. This argument suggests that if God is all-powerful and can answer prayers, then why doesn't He heal amputees? However, this line of reasoning is based on …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;God's Healing and Amputees&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question of why God does not heal amputees is often used as an argument against the existence of God. This argument suggests that if God is all-powerful and can answer prayers, then why doesn't He heal amputees? However, this line of reasoning is based on a skewed view of God and a misinterpretation of Scripture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1. God's Ability to Regenerate Limbs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One false assumption in the "Why won't God heal amputees?" argument is the idea that God has never caused a limb to regenerate. However, it is impossible to conclude that no amputee has ever been healed throughout history just because there is no empirical evidence of limb regeneration. We do have accounts in the Bible of Jesus healing lepers, some of whom may have had missing body parts. Additionally, there are instances of Jesus restoring a shriveled hand and even reattaching a severed ear. The fact that Jesus raised the dead also demonstrates His ability to perform miracles that are even more difficult than healing an amputee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2. The Curse of Sin and Physical Suffering&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Illness, suffering, and pain are consequences of living in a cursed world due to sin. When Adam and Eve sinned, the world fell under a curse, resulting in physical ailments and death. While God's love moved Him to provide a Savior to redeem us from this curse, our ultimate redemption will only be fully realized when sin is completely eradicated from the world. Until then, we are still subject to physical death and its effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;3. God's Definition of Love&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The argument assumes that if God truly loves us, He would heal every disease and infirmity. However, the biblical definition of love is a sacrificial seeking of what is best for the loved one. What is best for us is not always physical wholeness. Sometimes God allows physical suffering and disabilities to teach us important lessons and to grow in our understanding of His grace and power. Just like the apostle Paul, who prayed for his "thorn in the flesh" to be removed but was told by God that His grace was sufficient, we may need to learn that we don't need physical wholeness to experience the sustaining grace of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;4. Miracles in Biblical History&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Miracles, including physical healings, were more common during certain periods in biblical history. Throughout thousands of years covered in the Bible, there were only four short periods when miracles were widely performed: the Exodus, the time of the prophets Elijah and Elisha, the ministry of Jesus, and the time of the apostles. While miracles occurred throughout the Bible, they were not constantly present. Today, any ministry claiming to possess miraculous healing powers should be viewed with caution. While God can still heal people today, it is not as common as some claim it to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;5. Prayer in Jesus' Name&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The argument often misinterprets Jesus' promise that whatever we ask in His name will be done. This promise was specifically given to His apostles and was connected to spreading the gospel after His ascension. It does not mean that we can demand anything we want from God. Praying in Jesus' name implies praying according to His will and for what is best for us. God's wisdom ensures that He will always do what is ultimately best for us, even if it doesn't align with our immediate desires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Sfe0_EyPwTc" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;6. The Value of Faith and Eternal Perspective&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While physical suffering may seem unfair, Scripture reminds us that our present sufferings are incomparable to the glory that will be revealed in us. Our physical condition in this world is relatively unimportant compared to our eternal state. Jesus Himself said that it is better for a person to enter life maimed or crippled than to have all their physical abilities and be thrown into eternal fire. Our faith gives us the assurance that God will ultimately make all things right and that our future wholeness is guaranteed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;7. The Assumption of God's Non-Existence&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The underlying assumption behind the argument is that God does not exist, and religion is a myth. However, this assumption is not supported by evidence but serves as a foundational belief for those who use this argument. The question of why God doesn't heal amputees is designed to discredit faith rather than seeking the truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Addressing the question of why God doesn't heal amputees is crucial because it challenges our understanding of God's character and His interaction with the world. By examining this argument from a biblical perspective, we can deepen our faith and trust in God's sovereignty and goodness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider how your understanding of God's healing power may have been influenced by cultural expectations or popular beliefs. Reflect on how Scripture guides us to trust in God's wisdom and goodness, even when our prayers for physical healing are not immediately answered.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/God and Evil/Health Problems"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Divine Protection: 7 Biblical Responses to Natural Disasters</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/natural-disasters/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-04-11T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-04-11T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-04-11:/natural-disasters/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Natural Disasters: Understanding God's Role&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Natural disasters such as earthquakes, tornadoes, hurricanes, tsunamis, typhoons, cyclones, mudslides, wildfires, and others often lead people to question God's goodness. While tragedies like the 2023 earthquake in Turkey and Syria may shake our faith, it is essential to seek a deeper understanding of why God allows these events to occur. In this article, we will explore the reasons behind natural disasters from a biblical perspective and uncover how God can bring good out of terrible tragedies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Laws of Nature&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God created the entire universe and established the laws of nature (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/1/Genesis-1-1.html"&gt;Genesis 1:1&lt;/a&gt;). Many natural disasters are a consequence of these laws at work. For example, hurricanes, typhoons, and tornadoes result from colliding weather patterns. Earthquakes occur when the earth's plate structure shifts, while tsunamis are caused by underwater earthquakes. Therefore, it is crucial to recognize that most natural disasters are not direct acts of God but rather the result of the physical processes He put in place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Christ's Role in Nature&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bible teaches that Jesus Christ holds all of nature together (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Colossians/1/Colossians-1-16.html"&gt;Colossians 1:16-17&lt;/a&gt;). This means that even amidst natural disasters, God remains sovereign and in control. While God could prevent these events if He desired, there are instances where He does influence the weather (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Deuteronomy/11/Deuteronomy-11-17.html"&gt;Deuteronomy 11:17&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/James/5/James-5-17.html"&gt;James 5:17&lt;/a&gt;). Furthermore, Scripture reveals that God sometimes uses natural disasters as a form of judgment against sin (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Numbers/16/Numbers-16-30.html"&gt;Numbers 16:30-34&lt;/a&gt;). The book of Revelation also describes events that can be seen as natural disasters (Revelation chapters 6, 8, and 16).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Consequences of Sin&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to understand that not every natural disaster is a punishment from God. Similar to how God allows evil people to commit evil acts, He also allows the earth to reflect the consequences of sin. &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/8/Romans-8-19.html"&gt;Romans 8:19-21&lt;/a&gt; explains that creation waits for the redemption of God's children, as it was subjected to frustration and decay due to humanity's fall into sin. Sin is the underlying cause of natural disasters, just as it is responsible for death, disease, and suffering. Therefore, we must acknowledge that natural disasters are a result of living in a fallen world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Shaking Our Priorities&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One reason why God allows natural disasters is to shake our confidence in this temporary life and remind us of eternity. When disasters strike, they force us to confront the fragile nature of our existence. The uncertainty and devastation prompt many people to reevaluate their priorities and seek spiritual answers. It is often after such events that churches experience an influx of people seeking solace and understanding. These tragedies can lead individuals to recognize the brevity of life and consider their eternal destiny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding why God allows natural disasters is essential for believers. It helps us maintain our faith during difficult times and prepares us to minister to those affected by such events. Recognizing that God remains sovereign even in the face of tragedy provides comfort and reassurance that He can bring good out of terrible circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;God's Miracles in Disasters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While natural disasters can be devastating, many amazing miracles occur during these events, often preventing even greater loss of life. These miracles serve as a reminder of God's presence and intervention amidst the chaos. They demonstrate that even in the darkest moments, God can bring hope and salvation. These miraculous occurrences also showcase His power over creation and His ability to work through human circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/X4ZF9OwY4YM" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Responding with Compassion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Natural disasters offer an opportunity for Christians to demonstrate compassion and love towards those affected. When these tragedies strike, millions of people worldwide mobilize to send aid and support to those suffering. Christian ministries play a vital role in responding to disasters, providing practical assistance, ministering to emotional needs, offering counsel, and leading people to saving faith in Christ. These acts of kindness and service showcase the love of God and become a powerful witness to those who are hurting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Think About It:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider the impact of natural disasters on your own life and the lives of others. How do these events shape your perspective and priorities? In what ways can you respond with compassion and share the hope of Christ in the midst of tragedy?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;God's Goodness in Tragedy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we face natural disasters, it is essential to remember that God is good (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/100/Psalm-100-5.html"&gt;Psalm 100:5&lt;/a&gt;). Although we may not fully comprehend why He allows these events, we can trust that His character remains constant. Despite the pain and suffering caused by natural disasters, God can bring about great good from terrible tragedies (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/8/Romans-8-28.html"&gt;Romans 8:28&lt;/a&gt;). It is through these difficult circumstances that individuals are often prompted to seek Him, find salvation, experience His provision, and witness His miraculous works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, natural disasters hold a complex place within God's plan. While they are not direct acts of God, they are a consequence of living in a fallen world affected by sin. Understanding this perspective allows us to navigate these events with faith and compassion. As believers, we can trust that even in the midst of tragedy, God remains sovereign and can bring about good from even the most devastating circumstances. Let us respond with love, support, and a steadfast faith that shines brightly in times of darkness.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/God and Evil/War and Disasters"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Unveiling the Truth: Debunking Sexist Misconceptions in the Bible</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/god-bible-sexist/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-04-10T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-04-10T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-04-10:/god-bible-sexist/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Is the Bible Sexist?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bible is often criticized for containing passages that appear discriminatory towards women, but it is important to understand the context and purpose of these passages. While the Bible may describe actions that we now consider sexist, it does not mean that God endorses or approves …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Is the Bible Sexist?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bible is often criticized for containing passages that appear discriminatory towards women, but it is important to understand the context and purpose of these passages. While the Bible may describe actions that we now consider sexist, it does not mean that God endorses or approves of those actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During Old Testament times, nearly every society in the world followed a patriarchal structure where men held authority over women. This historical reality is clearly reflected in Scripture and the rules governing those societies. However, it is crucial to recognize that the establishment of authority in society was ordained by God, not man. Sadly, fallen humanity has corrupted this order, resulting in the inequality and discrimination experienced by women throughout history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is essential to understand that sexism is a result of sin. The exclusion and discrimination we find in our world are not new but are consequences of the fall of man and the introduction of sin. Therefore, we can say that the term and practice of "sexism" stem from sin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KIQxIl2HQzA" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the progressive revelation of the Bible ultimately leads us to the cure for sexism and all other sinful practices. The New Testament fulfills the Old Testament, providing principles that guide us towards the correct understanding of authority and addressing sin. The cross of Christ serves as the great equalizer, offering salvation to all who believe, regardless of their position in society, mental capacity, or gender.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Galatians/3/Galatians-3-26.html"&gt;Galatians 3:26-28&lt;/a&gt;, we find a passage that emphasizes our equal opportunity for salvation: "You are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus, for all of you who were baptized into Christ have clothed yourselves with Christ. There is neither Jew nor Greek, slave nor free, male nor female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus." Therefore, there is no room for sexism at the cross.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The accurate portrayal of sin in both men and women in the Bible does not make it inherently sexist. The Bible records all kinds of sin, including slavery, bondage, and the failures of its greatest heroes. However, it also provides the answer and cure for these sins—a right relationship with God. Through belief in Jesus Christ, we can find the cure for sin, including the sin of sexism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To achieve a spiritual balance between the God-ordained positions of authority, we must turn to Scripture. When men and women take their God-given places and live according to "thus says the LORD," a wonderful balance between genders can be achieved. This balance reflects God's original intent and will be restored in the end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the biblical perspective on sexism is essential for Christians as they navigate societal issues and engage in conversations about gender equality. It allows believers to approach these discussions with a solid foundation rooted in Scripture and enables them to address misconceptions about the Bible's stance on sexism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recognizing that sexism is a consequence of sin helps Christians understand that true equality can only be found in a personal reconciliation with God through Jesus Christ. This understanding allows believers to pursue justice and equality while acknowledging the ultimate solution lies in transformed hearts through faith in Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Think About It&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does recognizing the historical context of the Bible help us understand its portrayal of gender roles?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does the message of equality through faith in Christ challenge societal norms and expectations?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What steps can individuals take to promote biblical equality while living within the structures of authority established by God?&lt;/li&gt;

While we may pray and have faith for healing, if it is not in God's plan at that moment, we may not …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;God's Healing: Understanding His Will&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to the topic of God healing everyone, it is important to understand that physical healing is not always God's will. While we may pray and have faith for healing, if it is not in God's plan at that moment, we may not receive physical healing (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-John/5/1-John-5-14.html"&gt;1 John 5:14&lt;/a&gt;). It is crucial to recognize that God's blessings can come in various forms, not just through physical healing. If it were God's will for everyone to be healed, then no one would ever become ill or experience suffering. We cannot attribute someone's illness to a lack of faith, as the Bible shows that even faithful individuals like Paul and Trophimus experienced illness (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/2-Timothy/4/2-Timothy-4-20.html"&gt;2 Timothy 4:20&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/2-Corinthians/12/2-Corinthians-12-7.html"&gt;2 Corinthians 12:7&lt;/a&gt;–9).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, Christians have an oversimplified view of healing. They believe that if they are sick, they only need to ask God for healing, and because God loves them, He will heal them instantly. This perspective often sees healing as proof of a person's faith and God's love. However, this understanding overlooks the truth that parents do not give their children everything they ask for, even if they love them deeply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joni Eareckson Tada has grappled with this issue for many years. She prayed fervently for physical healing from her quadriplegia and had full belief that God would heal her. But she remains in a wheelchair today, forty-five years after her accident. Joni's perspective now reflects great faith as she understands that if God does not remove suffering, He will use it for His purpose and transform individuals through their struggles (Grace to You, October 16, 2013). It is important to recognize that our understanding of healing can be limited and that God works in ways beyond our comprehension.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding that physical healing is not always part of God's plan can help alleviate feelings of guilt or doubt when prayers for healing go unanswered. It allows us to trust in God's sovereignty and recognize that He works in ways that may not align with our desires or expectations. Embracing this perspective can lead to a deeper understanding of the purpose behind suffering and the opportunity for spiritual growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you ever felt disappointed or discouraged when prayers for healing were not answered? How does knowing that physical healing is not always God's will change your perspective on unanswered prayers? Consider how you can find hope and spiritual growth even in the midst of suffering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Healing: A Rare Occurrence&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is essential to recognize that healings, even in the Bible, are rare occurrences. For the first 2,500 years of biblical history, there is no mention of any healings. It is only during the life of Abraham that we potentially see a healing implied (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/12/Genesis-12-17.html"&gt;Genesis 12:17&lt;/a&gt;–20). The next healing mentioned is when Moses cleanses Miriam from leprosy (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Numbers/12/Numbers-12-13.html"&gt;Numbers 12:13&lt;/a&gt;–15). These examples highlight that healings were not a common occurrence throughout biblical history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Old Testament, under the Mosaic Covenant with Israel, there was an emphasis on physicality and material blessings. God promised Israel freedom from disease if they remained faithful to Him (Deuteronomy 28). This context helps us understand the meaning of miracles in the Bible. Healings were signs from God, primarily for the Jews under the Old Covenant, validating the authority of leaders like Moses and confirming the truth of their message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the coming of Christ, we witness the fulfillment of the Mosaic Covenant (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/5/Matthew-5-17.html"&gt;Matthew 5:17&lt;/a&gt;) and a reversal of Israel's spiritual decline. Jesus healed the sick wherever He went, not simply out of kindness but as a sign from heaven, demonstrating His authority as the Messiah (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/7/John-7-31.html"&gt;John 7:31&lt;/a&gt;). These healings allowed Israel to experience a taste of the kingdom of God (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/11/Luke-11-20.html"&gt;Luke 11:20&lt;/a&gt;). However, those who rejected Jesus' authority often remained sick (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/13/Matthew-13-58.html"&gt;Matthew 13:58&lt;/a&gt;). It is important to note that Jesus did not heal everyone but healed specific individuals within a multitude.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The apostles were also given the power to heal the sick, and for thirty-seven years, they went everywhere, performing these miracles as confirmation of the truth of the gospel they proclaimed. However, even the apostles did not heal everyone they encountered. The apostle Paul, for instance, instructed Timothy to use wine for his frequent illnesses (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-Timothy/5/1-Timothy-5-23.html"&gt;1 Timothy 5:23&lt;/a&gt;). This shows that healing was not solely based on an individual's faith but was dependent on God's will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AdQ7Oc5JPUc" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recognizing that healings were rare occurrences throughout biblical history helps us understand that physical healing is not a guarantee today. It challenges our expectations and encourages us to trust in God's sovereignty. Additionally, it highlights the purpose of miracles as signs from God, validating His message and authority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider your understanding of miracles and healings in the Bible. How does knowing that healings were rare occurrences throughout history change your perspective on miraculous healing today? How might this understanding impact your faith and expectations?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Complexity of God's Will&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our present time, we are not living in the apostolic era when miracles and healings were more prevalent. While God can and does still heal today when He desires to do so, it is crucial to discern what God wants for each individual situation. Sometimes, God may choose to heal someone physically in this life, while other times He may have a different plan to reveal His glory through weakness. Ultimately, all sickness and death will be eradicated when Jesus returns (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Revelation/21/Revelation-21-4.html"&gt;Revelation 21:4&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is essential to remember that physical healing is just one aspect of God's healing. The greater healing that God offers is the cleansing of sinful hearts, which He performs every day. This spiritual healing is available to all who place their faith in Jesus Christ. While physical healing may not always be part of God's plan, the promise of eternal life and spiritual restoration is guaranteed for those who believe in Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding that physical healing is not always God's will enables us to focus on the greater healing that God offers through salvation. It reminds us of the ultimate hope we have in Christ and the promise of eternal life. This perspective can bring comfort and assurance even in the midst of physical suffering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reflect on your understanding of God's will regarding healing. How does knowing that physical healing is not always part of God's plan impact your perspective on suffering and the hope we have in Christ? Consider how you can find peace and comfort in the promise of eternal life and spiritual healing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, when it comes to the topic of God healing everyone, it is important to recognize that physical healing is not always part of His will. While we may pray for healing and have faith, it is crucial to trust in God's sovereignty and understand that His blessings come in various forms. Healing is not solely based on an individual's faith, as even faithful individuals like Paul experienced illness. We must also remember that healings were rare occurrences throughout biblical history, serving as signs from God to validate His message and authority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our present time, as we await Jesus' return, physical healing may or may not be part of God's plan for each situation. However, the greater healing that God offers is the cleansing of sinful hearts through faith in Jesus Christ. This spiritual restoration is available to all who believe, providing hope and assurance even in the midst of physical suffering. Let us trust in God's will, knowing that He works beyond our understanding and has a purpose for every circumstance.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/God and Evil/Health Problems"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry></feed>

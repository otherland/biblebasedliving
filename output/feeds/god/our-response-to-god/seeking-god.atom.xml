&lt;p&gt;Faith is a concept that holds great significance in Christianity. It is often associated with the idea of "blind faith," which refers to belief without true understanding or discrimination. However, is this the kind of faith that God desires us to have? Does God expect us to have a blind faith? To answer these questions, we will explore the topic of blind faith in the context of biblical teachings and examples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Example of Abraham's Faith&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most prominent examples of faith in the Old Testament is that of Abraham. God made a promise to Abraham that he would become the father of many nations, even though he and his wife Sarah were very old. In their old age, Sarah miraculously gave birth to their son Isaac. Then, God asked Abraham to offer Isaac as a sacrifice (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/22/Genesis-22-1.html"&gt;Genesis 22:1-19&lt;/a&gt;). Astonishingly, Abraham obeyed without questioning God's command. This incident might suggest that God commends blind faith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, if we delve deeper into the biblical account, we find a different perspective on Abraham's faith. In the book of Hebrews, Abraham's faith is described as a reasoned faith. Hebrews 11, often referred to as the hall of fame of faith, mentions Abraham multiple times. In verses 18-19, it states that Abraham "reasoned" that God had promised a great nation through Isaac and believed that even if Isaac were killed, God could raise him from the dead. Abraham's actions were not blind; they were based on reasoning and understanding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Importance of Reason and Understanding&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout Scripture, reason, wisdom, and logic are emphasized as valuable traits. &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Proverbs/3/Proverbs-3-13.html"&gt;Proverbs 3:13&lt;/a&gt; tells us that we are blessed when we gain knowledge and understanding. &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/5/Hebrews-5-12.html"&gt;Hebrews 5:12-14&lt;/a&gt; reproves those who do not seek growth in understanding. The Bereans in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Acts/17/Acts-17-11.html"&gt;Acts 17:11&lt;/a&gt; were commended for their diligent search of the Scriptures to verify the truth of Paul's teachings. The apostle Paul himself often used reason and logical arguments to persuade others of the truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God has given us the ability to think and reason, and He expects us to use this gift. The goal of reason and logic is to find truth, and Jesus, who claimed to be the truth (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/14/John-14-6.html"&gt;John 14:6&lt;/a&gt;), should be the ultimate destination of our reasoning. Therefore, our faith should not be blind; it should be based on knowledge of God's nature, His promises in Scripture, and our personal experience walking with Him every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uwNvdEV9720" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Nurturing a Reasoned Faith&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we are called to have a reasoned faith, there may be times when we have to act purely on faith without having the complete picture, just as Abraham did. However, even in such situations, our faith is not blind but based on what we know about God and His character. Abraham's faith was rooted in his lifetime of walking with God and experiencing His faithfulness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To nurture a reasoned faith, we can engage in various practices. First and foremost, studying the Scriptures is essential. By immersing ourselves in God's Word, we gain a deeper understanding of His nature and His promises. We can also seek wisdom through prayer, asking God for insight and understanding (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/James/1/James-1-5.html"&gt;James 1:5&lt;/a&gt;). Additionally, engaging in conversations with fellow believers and learning from their experiences can help us grow in our faith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the nature of faith is crucial because it shapes our relationship with God. If we view faith as blind belief without understanding, we may struggle to reconcile our doubts and questions with our desire to follow God. However, by embracing a reasoned faith, we can find assurance in knowing that God wants us to use our minds and hearts to seek Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reasoned faith also helps us navigate challenges and trials. When we encounter difficulties, our understanding of God's character and promises can provide us with the strength and hope to persevere. It allows us to approach God with confidence, knowing that He is faithful and trustworthy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How do you define faith? Does the concept of "blind faith" align with your understanding of faith?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reflect on Abraham's example of faith. How can you apply the principles of reasoned faith to your own life?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consider the role of reason and understanding in your relationship with God. How can you cultivate a deeper understanding of His nature and promises?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, blind faith is not the kind of faith that God desires from us. Instead, God calls us to have a reasoned faith based on our knowledge and understanding of Him. While there may be times when we have to act purely on faith without complete understanding, our faith is grounded in what we know about God's character, His promises in Scripture, and our personal experiences walking with Him. By embracing a reasoned faith, we can deepen our relationship with God and find strength in difficult times.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/Our Response to God/Seeking God"></category><category term="null"></category></entry><entry><title>'Essential Faith: Understanding God''s Requirement for Believers'</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/god-require-faith/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-08-24T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-08-24T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-08-24:/god-require-faith/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;God Requires Faith&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our relationship with God, just like our relationships with others, requires faith. Faith is an integral component of all relationships because we can never fully know another person. We cannot experience everything they experience or fully understand their thoughts and emotions. In the book of Proverbs, it …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;God Requires Faith&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our relationship with God, just like our relationships with others, requires faith. Faith is an integral component of all relationships because we can never fully know another person. We cannot experience everything they experience or fully understand their thoughts and emotions. In the book of Proverbs, it says, "The heart knows its own bitterness, and a stranger does not share its joy" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Proverbs/14/Proverbs-14-10.html"&gt;Proverbs 14:10&lt;/a&gt;). Even our own hearts can be deceptive and wicked, making it difficult for us to fully know ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we cannot fully know other finite human beings, how can we expect to fully know an infinite God? Even if God desired to fully reveal Himself to us, it would be impossible for us to comprehend Him completely. It would be like trying to pour the vastness of the ocean into a small measuring jar. However, God has revealed enough about Himself through His creation, the Bible, and His Son, Jesus Christ, that we can enter into a meaningful relationship with Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To have a relationship with God, we need to trust in Jesus Christ as the payment for our sins. Sin creates a barrier between a holy God and sinful humanity. Jesus, the sinless Son of God, died on the cross to take our punishment and bridge the gap between us and God. By believing in Him, we can become children of God and live eternally in His presence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout history, there have been instances where God revealed Himself more visibly to people. For example, during the exodus from Egypt, God demonstrated His love and power by sending miraculous plagues upon the Egyptians and parting the Red Sea for the Israelites. He also provided them with food and guided them through a pillar of cloud and fire. However, even with these tangible demonstrations of His presence and care, the Israelites still struggled to trust Him when faced with challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eBJp_DWFqJw" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This reveals that further revelation from God would not necessarily increase our ability to trust Him. Our sinful hearts are prone to rebellion and self-rule, as seen in the Israelites' response. The problem lies not in God insufficiently revealing Himself, but in our sinful nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God has revealed enough of His nature for us to trust Him. Through history, nature, and Jesus Christ, He has shown that He is all-powerful, all-knowing, all-wise, all-loving, all-holy, unchanging, and eternal. In this revelation, He has proven Himself worthy of our trust. However, the choice to trust Him ultimately rests with us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To deepen our understanding of God, we should study the Bible carefully. The Bible is God's inerrant Word and provides insights into His character and plan for humanity. By relying on Jesus Christ as our Savior and studying His Word, we can come to know God more intimately and have a close relationship with Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the role of faith in our relationship with God is crucial for every Christian. It helps us recognize that faith is not blind or arbitrary but based on the evidence of God's revelation throughout history and in Scripture. Recognizing this can strengthen our trust and reliance on God, even when faced with challenging circumstances or unanswered questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reflect on your own relationship with God. How has faith played a role in it?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consider the different ways God has revealed Himself to you personally. How have these revelations deepened your faith?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are there areas in your life where you struggle to trust God? How can a deeper understanding of His character and past faithfulness help you overcome those struggles?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take time to study the Bible and discover more about who God is and what He has done. How can this knowledge deepen your faith and relationship with Him?&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Believing in God goes beyond simply acknowledging His existence. It requires a deep faith and commitment to a relationship with Him. The Bible tells us that without faith, it is impossible to please God (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/11/Hebrews-11-6.html"&gt;Hebrews 11:6&lt;/a&gt;). So, what does it mean to believe in God?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Believing in God goes beyond simply acknowledging His existence. It requires a deep faith and commitment to a relationship with Him. The Bible tells us that without faith, it is impossible to please God (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/11/Hebrews-11-6.html"&gt;Hebrews 11:6&lt;/a&gt;). So, what does it mean to believe in God?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Acknowledging God's Existence&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first step in believing in God is acknowledging His existence. Many people around the world believe in some form of the supernatural or a higher power. However, simply believing that God exists is not enough. Even the demons believe in God's existence (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/James/2/James-2-19.html"&gt;James 2:19&lt;/a&gt;). Our belief in God should go beyond mere acknowledgement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Commitment and a Change of Life&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Believing in God should lead to a commitment and a change of life. It's not enough to believe in God without allowing that belief to transform our actions and behavior. Just like how we may believe in the importance of good diet and exercise, but fail to change our lives accordingly, many people believe in God but do not live out their faith. &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/James/1/James-1-26.html"&gt;James 1:26&lt;/a&gt; tells us that faith without actions is dead. Belief in God should inspire us to live according to His will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;True Belief Based on Who God Is&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genuine belief in God is based on who He truly is, as revealed in the Bible. Many people create their own idea of God, picking and choosing aspects that align with their preferences. But true belief requires accepting and worshiping the Triune God who is perfect, omniscient, omnipotent, all-sufficient, immutable, true, faithful, gracious, loving, merciful, holy, and just. We must align our belief with the reality of who God is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Jesus Christ as the Ultimate Revelation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FtUNQpu2b7Q" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To truly believe in God as He has revealed Himself, we must also believe in Jesus Christ. He is the radiance of God's glory and the exact representation of His being (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/1/Hebrews-1-3.html"&gt;Hebrews 1:3&lt;/a&gt;). Through Jesus, God has shown Himself to us in a way we can understand. Jesus declared that anyone who has seen Him has seen the Father, emphasizing the inseparable connection between Him and God (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/14/John-14-9.html"&gt;John 14:9&lt;/a&gt;–11). Faith in God must include faith in Jesus Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Believing in God is not just about intellectual assent. It requires a genuine relationship with Him and a commitment to live according to His will. Our belief should be based on who God truly is, as revealed in the Bible. Jesus Christ is the ultimate revelation of God, and faith in Him is essential for a true belief in God. Without this belief, we cannot honor God or have a genuine relationship with Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take a moment to reflect on your own belief in God. Is it based on who He truly is, or have you created your own version of Him? Are you living out your faith in practical ways, allowing it to transform your actions and behavior? Consider the importance of believing in Jesus Christ as the ultimate revelation of God and the key to having a genuine relationship with Him.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/Our Response to God/Seeking God"></category><category term="null"></category></entry><entry><title>'7 Divine Characteristics of God Unveiled: A Christian Perspective'</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/characteristics-of-god/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-05-25T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-05-25T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-05-25:/characteristics-of-god/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Characteristics of God&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bible reveals the characteristics of God to believers, giving us insight into His nature and qualities. As mortal beings, it can be challenging for us to fully comprehend the power and majesty of the God who created everything. The prophet Isaiah reminds us, “For my thoughts …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Characteristics of God&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bible reveals the characteristics of God to believers, giving us insight into His nature and qualities. As mortal beings, it can be challenging for us to fully comprehend the power and majesty of the God who created everything. The prophet Isaiah reminds us, “For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways” (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/55/Isaiah-55-8.html"&gt;Isaiah 55:8&lt;/a&gt;). In this article, we will explore three key characteristics of God and how believers should respond to each.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Holiness of God&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most important attributes of God is His holiness. The Bible describes God as holy in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/6/Isaiah-6-3.html"&gt;Isaiah 6:3&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Revelation/4/Revelation-4-8.html"&gt;Revelation 4:8&lt;/a&gt;, where it says, “Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God almighty, who was, and is, and is to come.” When we catch a glimpse of God's holiness in contrast to our own sinful nature, it brings us to a place of true repentance. Recognizing the consequences of sin and understanding that Jesus suffered on our behalf humbles us. We are silenced before the face of God's holiness, overwhelmed by the reverence such holiness demands. Job expressed this sentiment when he said, “I am unworthy—how can I reply to you? I put my hand over my mouth” (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Job/40/Job-40-4.html"&gt;Job 40:4&lt;/a&gt;). Understanding God's holiness leads us to appreciate His compassion (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/2-Corinthians/1/2-Corinthians-1-3.html"&gt;2 Corinthians 1:3&lt;/a&gt;), mercy (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/9/Romans-9-15.html"&gt;Romans 9:15&lt;/a&gt;), grace, and forgiveness (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/5/Romans-5-17.html"&gt;Romans 5:17&lt;/a&gt;) towards us. &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/130/Psalm-130-3.html"&gt;Psalm 130:3&lt;/a&gt;–4 acknowledges that if God kept a record of our sins, no one could stand before Him. However, because He offers forgiveness, we reverence Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Recognizing God's holiness helps us understand the seriousness of sin and our need for repentance and forgiveness. It also allows us to appreciate His compassion and mercy towards us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; How does understanding God's holiness impact your view of sin and the importance of repentance?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nxwzq1PJImM" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The Love of God&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God's love is perhaps His most endearing characteristic. Love necessitates a relationship, and from eternity past, the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit have existed in perfect relationship with one another. We were created in God's image to be in relationship with Him (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/3/Genesis-3-17.html"&gt;Genesis 3:17&lt;/a&gt;–18; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/1/Romans-1-19.html"&gt;Romans 1:19&lt;/a&gt;–20). God's love for us is so great that He sent His only Son, Jesus, to redeem us from our sins. The apostle John tells us, “This is how we know what love is: Jesus Christ laid down his life for us. And we ought to lay down our lives for our brothers and sisters” (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-John/3/1-John-3-16.html"&gt;1 John 3:16&lt;/a&gt;–19). Through Jesus, God provided a solution for our sin, taking on our punishment to satisfy His justice (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/1/John-1-1.html"&gt;John 1:1&lt;/a&gt;–5, 14, 29). At the cross, God's perfect love and perfect justice intersected. When we begin to grasp the depth of God's love for us, our response is one of humility, repentance, and reciprocal love. Like King David, we pray that God will create in us a pure heart and a steadfast spirit (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/34/Psalm-34-18.html"&gt;Psalm 34:18&lt;/a&gt;; 51:10, 17). Although God dwells in a high and holy place, He is also near to those who are humble in spirit (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/57/Isaiah-57-15.html"&gt;Isaiah 57:15&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Understanding and experiencing God's love transforms our hearts and motivates us to love Him and others in return.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; How does knowing that God loves you unconditionally impact your relationship with Him and others?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Sovereignty of God&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God's sovereignty is another crucial aspect of His character. He is eternal, existing from everlasting to everlasting (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/90/Psalm-90-2.html"&gt;Psalm 90:2&lt;/a&gt;). He is the source of all life (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/11/Romans-11-33.html"&gt;Romans 11:33&lt;/a&gt;–36) and is independent of His creation (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Acts/17/Acts-17-24.html"&gt;Acts 17:24&lt;/a&gt;–28). Throughout Scripture, faithful individuals like Abraham, Samuel, Isaiah, Daniel, and David acknowledged God as their Sovereign Lord. In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-Chronicles/29/1-Chronicles-29-10.html"&gt;1 Chronicles 29:10&lt;/a&gt;–13, David praises God, recognizing His greatness, power, glory, majesty, and splendor. Believers honor our Sovereign Lord who has redeemed us and willingly submit to Him (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/2-Peter/2/2-Peter-2-1.html"&gt;2 Peter 2:1&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/James/4/James-4-7.html"&gt;James 4:7&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Jude/1/Jude-1-4.html"&gt;Jude 1:4&lt;/a&gt;). King David beautifully captures the characteristics of God when he declares, “The Lord reigns, he is robed in majesty; the Lord is robed in majesty and armed with strength. The world is firmly established; it cannot be moved. Your throne was established long ago; you are from all eternity. . . . The Lord on high is mighty. Your statutes stand firm; holiness adorns your house for endless days, O Lord” (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/93/Psalm-93-1.html"&gt;Psalm 93:1&lt;/a&gt;–2, 4–5).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Recognizing God's sovereignty helps us trust in Him and surrender to His plans and purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; How does acknowledging God's sovereignty impact your faith and trust in Him?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many other characteristics of God revealed in the Bible. For example, God's faithfulness leads us to trust Him, His grace prompts gratitude, His power incites awe, and His knowledge encourages us to seek wisdom (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/James/1/James-1-5.html"&gt;James 1:5&lt;/a&gt;). Those who truly know God conduct themselves in holiness and honor (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-Thessalonians/4/1-Thessalonians-4-4.html"&gt;1 Thessalonians 4:4&lt;/a&gt;–5).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we consider these characteristics of God, it is important to respond appropriately. We should approach Him with reverence, humility, and gratitude. Just as Moses, Job, Isaiah, and John responded in awe and repentance when encountering God's glory, our hearts should also be filled with worship and submission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, the Bible provides insights into the characteristics of God. His holiness calls us to repentance and appreciation for His compassion and forgiveness. His love transforms our hearts and motivates us to respond in love towards Him and others. His sovereignty reminds us to trust in Him and surrender to His plans. Understanding these characteristics helps us develop a deeper relationship with God and live in alignment with His will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;May we continually seek to know God more deeply, responding to His character with reverence, humility, and love.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/Our Response to God/Seeking God"></category><category term="null"></category></entry><entry><title>10 Powerful Ways to Strengthen Your Faith in God</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/faith-in-god/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-04-30T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-04-30T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-04-30:/faith-in-god/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Faith in God&lt;/h2&gt;

It is not simply believing that God exists, but also committing to live according to His principles. Genuine faith in God must be based on accepting Him as He has revealed Himself in Scripture, without picking and choosing the attributes we prefer. Faith in God is not a blind leap without evidence or contrary to evidence; rather, it is trust in God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What is Faith in God?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Faith in God has several components. The first is acknowledging that He exists. However, mere belief in God's existence is not enough, as even demons believe in God (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/James/2/James-2-19.html"&gt;James 2:19&lt;/a&gt;). The second element of faith in God is commitment. True faith in God results in action, demonstrating a changed life (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/James/2/James-2-26.html"&gt;James 2:26&lt;/a&gt;). But commitment alone is not sufficient either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For faith in God to be genuine, we must accept Him as He has revealed Himself in Scripture. We cannot create our own version of God by accepting only the attributes we like and rejecting the ones we don't. Any religion not based on the Bible is essentially a designer religion with a designer god. True faith in God must accept the triune nature of the God revealed in the Bible, including the deity and personality of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Faith vs. Science&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is often confusion regarding the nature of faith, with some viewing it as belief without evidence or contrary to evidence. However, faith in God is not a blind leap; rather, it is trust. In a similar way, scientific atheists have faith in science. When an atheist uses the scientific method to develop and take medicine, they are exercising faith in their data and trusting that the medicine will work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Faith is not the opposite of doubt; doubt can exist within faith itself. It is possible to exercise faith while still having uncertainties. Faith is a commitment to trust even when there are questions. Some people may trust God intuitively, having been raised in a Christian home and witnessing His work. Others may come to faith after carefully examining the evidence for God. Regardless of how faith is arrived at, it is the mark of genuine faith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding and having faith in God is foundational to the Christian life. It is not merely about believing that God exists, but about trusting Him and committing to live according to His principles. Faith in God is not blind, but based on a true understanding of who He is as revealed in Scripture. It is important to accept God as He has revealed Himself, without picking and choosing the attributes we prefer. True faith in God requires accepting the triune nature of God as revealed in the Bible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does your understanding of faith in God align with what has been discussed?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What aspects of God's character or attributes do you struggle with accepting?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In what ways can you demonstrate your commitment and trust in God through your actions?&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seeking the face of God is a concept that appears throughout Scripture, urging believers to pursue a deeper connection with the divine. While we cannot physically see God's face, seeking His face means seeking His presence and developing an intimate relationship with Him. In this article, we will explore the significance of seeking God's face and how it can transform our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Meaning Behind Seeking God's Face&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the context of the Bible, the Hebrew word for "face" is often translated as "presence." When we seek God's face, we are seeking His presence in our lives. This call to seek God's face was often issued to His people when they had turned away from Him and needed to return to Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as a person's face reveals their character and emotions, seeking God's face allows us to know Him more intimately. Our human condition and worldly desires often obscure God's holy character from us. That is why the Lord encourages us to continually seek His face. He desires to be our constant companion in every aspect of our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Seeking God's Face in Prayer&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Approaching God in prayer is one way we seek His face. The psalmist asks, "Who may ascend the mountain of the LORD? Who may stand in his holy place?" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/24/Psalm-24-3.html"&gt;Psalm 24:3&lt;/a&gt;). The answer lies in having clean hands and a pure heart, trusting in God alone. When we seek God's face through prayer, we receive His blessings and vindication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;True worship involves seeking God's face. As Christians, our journey is devoted to seeking God's presence and favor. The Lord wants us to humbly and trustingly seek His face in our prayers and through studying His Word. This pursuit requires intimacy with Him, just as looking intently into someone's face conveys closeness. Seeking God's face is about developing an intimate relationship with Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Blessing of God's Smiling Face&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having God's face smile upon us is a powerful expression of His blessing, love, and favor. In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Numbers/6/Numbers-6-25.html"&gt;Numbers 6:25&lt;/a&gt;, we read, "May the LORD smile on you and be gracious to you." When we draw close to God and seek His face, we experience His shining favor. It is important to note that seeking God's face is not solely about presenting our wants and needs to Him. He already knows what we need (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/6/Matthew-6-7.html"&gt;Matthew 6:7&lt;/a&gt;–8, 32–33). Instead, seeking God's face means desiring to know His character and wanting Him—His presence—more than anything else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seeking God's face is not merely a religious duty; it is an invitation to experience a transformative relationship with our Creator. When we seek His face, we open ourselves up to His presence, guidance, and blessings in our lives. It is through seeking God's face that we can truly know Him intimately and grow in our faith.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How often do you intentionally seek God's face in prayer? What steps can you take to prioritize seeking His presence in your daily life?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In what ways have you experienced God's shining favor when you have drawn close to Him? Reflect on those moments and consider how they have impacted your faith journey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are there any distractions or worldly desires that are hindering your ability to seek God's face? Take time to identify and surrender these obstacles to Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How does seeking God's face differ from seeking His blessings or material things? Consider how you can shift your focus from seeking things to seeking a deeper connection with Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, seeking the face of God is an invitation to pursue His presence and develop an intimate relationship with Him. Through prayer, worship, and a desire to know His character, we can experience His blessings and favor in our lives. As we prioritize seeking God's face, we will find ourselves transformed and drawn closer to Him, ready to receive the abundant life He has in store for us.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/Our Response to God/Seeking God"></category><category term="null"></category></entry><entry><title>Discover 7 Proven Ways to Find God in Your Daily Life</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/find-god/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-04-26T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-04-26T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-04-26:/find-god/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Finding God: A Journey of Faith&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The phrase "finding God" can have different meanings for different individuals. It encompasses various interpretations, including finding a religious affiliation or experiencing a spiritual transformation. Ultimately, finding God involves a change in attitude and behavior, leading to a deeper connection with the divine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Recognizing Our Longing for God&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many individuals throughout history have earnestly sought to find God. Job, in his distress, expressed his desire to find God and present his case before the Judge of the universe (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Job/23/Job-23-3.html"&gt;Job 23:3&lt;/a&gt;). The sons of Korah also yearned to find God, comparing their longing for Him to a deer's thirst for water (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/42/Psalm-42-1.html"&gt;Psalm 42:1&lt;/a&gt;–2).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As humans, we naturally long for meaning and purpose in life. This longing often manifests as a deep desire to connect with something greater than ourselves. The Bible acknowledges this innate longing and reveals that our search for God is not in vain. In fact, God commands us to seek Him and promises that those who diligently seek Him will find Him (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/55/Isaiah-55-6.html"&gt;Isaiah 55:6&lt;/a&gt;–7).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/o_4s8HbDgto" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Finding God Through Jesus Christ&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the Bible, finding God ultimately involves accepting Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior. Jesus Himself declared, "I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/14/John-14-6.html"&gt;John 14:6&lt;/a&gt;). Through faith in Christ, we experience a spiritual transformation. As the apostle Paul wrote, "Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, the new creation has come: The old has gone, the new is here!" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/2-Corinthians/5/2-Corinthians-5-17.html"&gt;2 Corinthians 5:17&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we find God through Jesus Christ, we enter into a personal relationship with Him. This relationship is characterized by love, grace, and forgiveness. It is through Jesus that we can experience reconciliation with our Creator and receive the gift of eternal life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Seeking God's Mercy and Goodness&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bible assures us that when we seek God, we will find Him, and He will shower us with His mercy and goodness. The psalmist declares, "Those who know your name trust in you, for you, Lord, have never forsaken those who seek you" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/9/Psalm-9-10.html"&gt;Psalm 9:10&lt;/a&gt;). Another psalmist encourages us to seek God's face, promising that those who do so will experience His presence and blessings (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/22/Psalm-22-26.html"&gt;Psalm 22:26&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God desires to be found by us. He is not far off or distant but is near to all who call on Him. As the Apostle Paul taught, God orchestrates circumstances in our lives so that we would seek Him and perhaps reach out for Him and find Him, for He is intimately involved in our lives (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Acts/17/Acts-17-27.html"&gt;Acts 17:27&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finding God is a significant pursuit in the life of a believer. It goes beyond mere religious observance or adherence to a set of rules. It involves a personal encounter with the living God and a transformation of the heart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through finding God, we discover our true purpose and identity. We experience His love, grace, and forgiveness, which brings healing and restoration to our lives. Finding God also empowers us to live out the Christian life and fulfill the calling He has placed on each of us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What does it mean for you personally to "find God"? How has this journey impacted your life?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does seeking God differ from seeking other things in life? How can we prioritize our search for God above all else?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reflect on instances where you have experienced God's mercy and goodness as a result of seeking Him. How did these encounters strengthen your faith?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, finding God is a transformative journey that involves recognizing our longing for Him, accepting Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior, and seeking His mercy and goodness. It is through this journey that we can experience a deep and meaningful relationship with our Creator. May we continue to seek God wholeheartedly and allow Him to guide us in every aspect of our lives.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="God/Our Response to God/Seeking God"></category><category term="null"></category></entry></feed>

&lt;h3&gt;The Gift of Speaking in Tongues&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To understand …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Jesus and Speaking in Tongues&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The topic of Jesus speaking in tongues is an intriguing one, often discussed within Christian circles. However, when we examine the biblical evidence, we find no indication that Jesus actually spoke in tongues. Let's explore this further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Gift of Speaking in Tongues&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To understand the discussion around Jesus speaking in tongues, it is important to first understand the gift of speaking in tongues as described in the Bible. According to &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-Corinthians/14/1-Corinthians-14-6.html"&gt;1 Corinthians 14:6&lt;/a&gt;, speaking in tongues occurs when someone speaks a language they do not know in order to edify someone who does speak that language. It is a supernatural form of speech that enables communication between individuals who speak different languages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;No Evidence of Jesus Speaking in Tongues&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Jesus were to speak in tongues, it would have made sense for Him to do so at His baptism when the Holy Spirit descended upon Him like a dove (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/1/Mark-1-10.html"&gt;Mark 1:10&lt;/a&gt;). However, the Bible does not record Jesus speaking in tongues on this or any other occasion. While some advocates of today's tongues movement assume that Jesus did speak in tongues, there is no scriptural evidence to support this claim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Misinterpretations and Sighs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9fXTqADUWr0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Advocates for Jesus speaking in tongues often point to passages such as &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/7/Mark-7-34.html"&gt;Mark 7:34&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/8/Mark-8-12.html"&gt;Mark 8:12&lt;/a&gt; as evidence. In these verses, it is mentioned that Jesus looked up to heaven with a deep sigh and sighed deeply in His spirit. However, it is important to note that a sigh is not the same as the supernatural gift of tongues. Anyone can sigh for various reasons, but it does not prove the presence of the Holy Spirit's power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Languages Spoken by Jesus&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We do have evidence from the Bible that Jesus spoke Aramaic, which was the most common language spoken in Israel during His time (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/5/Mark-5-41.html"&gt;Mark 5:41&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Acts/26/Acts-26-14.html"&gt;Acts 26:14&lt;/a&gt;). Additionally, it is likely that Jesus was also conversant in Hebrew and Greek, as these languages were used in the region. However, whether or not Jesus spoke with supernatural power in another language, the Bible does not provide any explicit information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question of whether Jesus spoke in tongues may seem insignificant to some, but it has implications for our understanding of His divine nature and purpose. By examining the biblical evidence, we can have a clearer understanding of the gifts and abilities that Jesus possessed during His earthly ministry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Christians, it is essential to base our beliefs and interpretations on what the Bible explicitly states. While there are various opinions and theories about Jesus speaking in tongues, we must rely on the scriptural evidence available to us. By doing so, we ensure that our faith is grounded in truth and aligns with the teachings of the Bible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, there is no evidence in the Bible to support the claim that Jesus spoke in tongues. The gift of speaking in tongues is described as speaking a language one does not know in order to communicate with someone who speaks that language. While Jesus spoke Aramaic and likely knew Hebrew and Greek, there is no record of Him speaking with supernatural power in another language. It is important for us as Christians to rely on biblical evidence when forming our beliefs and interpretations.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Jesus Christ/The Person of Jesus/Jesus’ Religion"></category><category term="null"></category></entry><entry><title>'Why Jesus Fasted: Revealing the Spiritual Power Behind His Actions'</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/why-did-jesus-fast/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-08-12T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-08-12T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-08-12:/why-did-jesus-fast/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Why Did Jesus Fast?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fasting is an important spiritual practice that has been observed by believers throughout history.

&lt;p&gt;Fasting is an important spiritual practice that has been observed by believers throughout history. In the Bible, we find numerous instances where people fasted to seek God's guidance, express repentance, or deepen their relationship with Him. Jesus himself engaged in fasting at various points during His earthly ministry. But why did Jesus fast? What was the significance of this practice for Him? In this article, we will explore six key reasons behind Jesus' decision to fast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1. Preparation for Ministry&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the primary reasons Jesus fasted was to prepare Himself for His public ministry. Before He began His three years of teaching, healing, and proclaiming the Kingdom of God, Jesus spent forty days and nights in the wilderness, engaged in a period of intense fasting and prayer. This time of solitude and self-denial allowed Him to focus solely on His mission and align Himself with the Father's will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During this period, Jesus faced various temptations from Satan but remained steadfast in His commitment to God. His fasting served as a way to strengthen His resolve, deepen His reliance on God's power, and overcome the temptations that would distract Him from fulfilling His purpose. By entering into this season of fasting, Jesus demonstrated the importance of spiritual preparation before embarking on significant tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; As believers, we can learn from Jesus' example of preparation through fasting. Before stepping into new seasons or endeavors, it is essential to seek God's guidance and align ourselves with His plans through prayer and self-denial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; How can you incorporate fasting as a means of preparation in your own life? What areas do you need to seek God's guidance and strength for?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2. Identification with Humanity&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another crucial reason behind Jesus' decision to fast was to identify with humanity's experiences and struggles. In becoming fully human while remaining fully divine, Jesus chose to undergo the same physical and emotional challenges we face. Fasting was one way for Him to enter into the human experience of hunger and weakness, allowing Him to relate to our needs and limitations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During His forty-day fast in the wilderness, Jesus experienced hunger and physical weakness. By willingly subjecting Himself to these hardships, He demonstrated His solidarity with humanity. This identification with our weaknesses further emphasizes His role as the compassionate Savior who understands our struggles and is able to help us in our times of need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Jesus' decision to fast shows us that He not only sympathizes with our weaknesses but also understands them experientially. We can take comfort in knowing that we serve a Savior who can empathize with our struggles and provide the strength we need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; How does Jesus' identification with our struggles through fasting impact your understanding of His love and compassion for you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;3. Spiritual Discipline&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fasting is a spiritual discipline that involves voluntarily abstaining from food or certain types of food for a specific period. It is a practice that helps believers cultivate self-control, discipline, and a deeper dependence on God. Jesus engaged in fasting as a means of spiritual discipline throughout His ministry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/4/Matthew-4-2.html"&gt;Matthew 4:2&lt;/a&gt;, we read that Jesus went without food for forty days and nights. This extended period of fasting required immense discipline and reliance on God's sustenance. By practicing this spiritual discipline, Jesus modeled for us the importance of self-control and the cultivation of spiritual habits that draw us closer to God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Fasting as a spiritual discipline helps us develop self-control and deepen our reliance on God's provision. It serves as a means to grow in our relationship with Him and become more attuned to His leading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; How can incorporating fasting into your spiritual life help you develop self-control and deepen your dependence on God?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;4. Intensified Prayer&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fasting and prayer often go hand in hand. Throughout the Bible, we see individuals fasting as a way to seek God's guidance and express their earnestness in prayer. Jesus understood the power of combining fasting with prayer and frequently engaged in both simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/17/Matthew-17-21.html"&gt;Matthew 17:21&lt;/a&gt;, Jesus talks about a particular kind of demon that can only be driven out through prayer and fasting. This verse highlights the effectiveness of fasting as a way to intensify our prayers and seek God's intervention in challenging situations. By fasting, Jesus demonstrated the importance of seeking God's guidance and intervention through focused and committed prayer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Fasting can serve as a catalyst for deepening our prayer life and seeking God's intervention more fervently. It can help us align our hearts with His purposes and experience breakthroughs in our spiritual journey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; How can incorporating fasting into your prayer life help you deepen your communion with God and experience greater breakthroughs?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KuDqMBWxcYY" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;5. Spiritual Warfare&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another significant reason for Jesus' decision to fast was to engage in spiritual warfare. Fasting is an act of self-denial that weakens our physical bodies but strengthens our spirits. It helps us focus on the spiritual realm and engage in battle against spiritual forces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/9/Mark-9-29.html"&gt;Mark 9:29&lt;/a&gt;, Jesus encountered a man possessed by an unclean spirit that His disciples were unable to cast out. Jesus explained that this type of spirit could only be driven out by prayer and fasting. By engaging in fasting, Jesus exhibited His authority over the spiritual realm and demonstrated the effectiveness of fasting as a weapon in spiritual warfare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Fasting can be a powerful tool in our spiritual battle against the enemy. It allows us to tap into God's strength and authority, enabling us to overcome the forces of darkness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; In what areas of your life do you need to engage in spiritual warfare? How can fasting be a means of seeking victory in those areas?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;6. Seeking God's Will&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, Jesus fasted as a way to seek God's will and direction. In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/4/Luke-4-1.html"&gt;Luke 4:1-2&lt;/a&gt;, we find that Jesus was led by the Holy Spirit into the wilderness, where He fasted for forty days and nights. This period of fasting allowed Him to focus on God's voice and discern His plan for His ministry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By fasting, Jesus demonstrated the importance of seeking God's will above all else. It enabled Him to align His desires with the Father's purposes and to stay on the path God had set before Him. Fasting served as a means for Jesus to cultivate sensitivity to God's leading and to ensure that His actions were in line with the Father's heart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Fasting can help us seek God's will and align our desires with His purposes. It allows us to tune our hearts to His voice and discern His guidance more clearly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; How can incorporating fasting into your life help you seek God's will and align your desires with His purposes?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus' decision to fast during His earthly ministry was multi-faceted. It served as a means of preparation, identification with humanity, spiritual discipline, intensified prayer, engagement in spiritual warfare, and seeking God's will. By understanding these reasons, we can appreciate the significance of fasting in our own lives as we seek to follow in the footsteps of our Savior. Let us embrace fasting as a spiritual practice that draws us closer to God and enables us to fulfill His purposes for our lives.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Jesus Christ/The Person of Jesus/Jesus’ Religion"></category><category term="null"></category></entry><entry><title>Was Jesus a Christian?

&lt;p&gt;Jesus, the central figure of Christianity, was born into a Jewish family and grew up in a Jewish community that followed the Jewish law. His lineage can be traced back to the tribe of Judah, one of the twelve tribes of Israel. The town of Bethlehem was his birthplace, and he was raised in Nazareth. Therefore, it is safe to say that Jesus was deeply immersed in Jewish culture, nationality, and religion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Practice of Judaism&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During his time on earth, Jesus practiced the religion of first-century Judaism. He was "born under the law" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Galatians/4/Galatians-4-4.html"&gt;Galatians 4:4&lt;/a&gt;) and adhered to the teachings of the Torah. He not only obeyed the Mosaic Law but also fulfilled it, bringing its requirements to a close (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/5/Matthew-5-17.html"&gt;Matthew 5:17&lt;/a&gt;–18; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/10/Romans-10-4.html"&gt;Romans 10:4&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Observance of Feasts and Festivals&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus and his disciples observed various Jewish feasts and festivals. For example, they celebrated the Passover (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/2/John-2-13.html"&gt;John 2:13&lt;/a&gt;, 23; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/22/Luke-22-7.html"&gt;Luke 22:7&lt;/a&gt;–8) and the Feast of Tabernacles (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/7/John-7-2.html"&gt;John 7:2&lt;/a&gt;, 10). In addition, there are references to Jesus attending an unnamed Jewish feast in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/5/John-5-1.html"&gt;John 5:1&lt;/a&gt;. This demonstrates his participation in Jewish religious traditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Synagogue Attendance and Teaching&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus regularly attended worship services and taught in synagogues (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/1/Mark-1-21.html"&gt;Mark 1:21&lt;/a&gt;; 3:1; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/6/John-6-59.html"&gt;John 6:59&lt;/a&gt;; 18:20). His presence in these settings highlights his involvement in Jewish religious life. Furthermore, he respected the scribes and Pharisees who taught the Law as it was understood during his time (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/23/Matthew-23-1.html"&gt;Matthew 23:1&lt;/a&gt;–3).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Knowledge of Scriptures&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ITEzXLcpKZs" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus frequently quoted from the Tanakh (the Hebrew Bible) during his teachings (e.g., &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/12/Mark-12-28.html"&gt;Mark 12:28&lt;/a&gt;–31; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/4/Luke-4-4.html"&gt;Luke 4:4&lt;/a&gt;, 8, 12). This demonstrates his familiarity with and reliance on Jewish scriptures. Jesus upheld the importance of these sacred texts and incorporated their teachings into his own messages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Jesus and His Religion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to note that Jesus did not deviate from the religious observances of Judaism. When addressing a group of Jews, he challenged them by asking, "Can any of you prove me guilty of sin?" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/8/John-8-46.html"&gt;John 8:46&lt;/a&gt;). If Jesus had departed from the religious practices of Judaism, his adversaries would have undoubtedly used this as an opportunity to condemn him. However, throughout his life, Jesus consistently adhered to Jewish customs and traditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Condemnation of Religious Leaders&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Jesus criticized the religious leaders of his day, it is crucial to understand that his condemnation was not directed at the Jewish religion itself. Instead, he condemned those who taught man-made ideas as commands from God (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/15/Matthew-15-9.html"&gt;Matthew 15:9&lt;/a&gt;, NLT). Jesus sought to purify Judaism by challenging corrupt practices and hypocrisy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The Fulfillment of the Law&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus' purpose was not to destroy Judaism but to fulfill it. He perfectly followed the Law and brought it to completion. His death marked the end of the Old Covenant God had made with Israel, as symbolized by the tearing of the temple veil (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/15/Mark-15-38.html"&gt;Mark 15:38&lt;/a&gt;), and established the New Covenant (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/22/Luke-22-20.html"&gt;Luke 22:20&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Early Church and Judaism&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The early Christian church had its roots in Judaism and Jewish messianism. The earliest followers of Christ were predominantly Jewish. However, as they proclaimed Jesus as the long-awaited Messiah, many Jews rejected this message. Consequently, the early believers were forced to separate themselves from mainstream Judaism (see &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Acts/13/Acts-13-45.html"&gt;Acts 13:45&lt;/a&gt;–47).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding that Jesus was raised in and practiced first-century Judaism provides important context for interpreting his teachings and actions. It highlights the continuity between Jewish religious traditions and the emergence of Christianity. Recognizing Jesus' Jewish background can deepen our appreciation for his fulfillment of the Law and the significance of his sacrificial death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does knowing that Jesus practiced Judaism inform your understanding of his teachings?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How might Jesus' Jewish background affect your perspective on the relationship between Christianity and Judaism?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In what ways can Jesus' observance of Jewish customs and traditions inspire Christians to appreciate their own religious heritage?&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this article, we will explore the relationship between Jesus, Jews, Christians, and Judaism. We will address the question of why Christians do not follow Judaism despite Jesus being a Jew. It is important to understand that the laws of Judaism were given to Moses for the children of Israel in a sacred covenant at Mount Sinai. This covenant was recorded in the book of Exodus, and Israel was commanded to be obedient to all that was revealed to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Covenant of Moses&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The covenant given to the children of Israel through Moses was a special and significant event in their history. God wrote His laws on tablets of stone, and Israel was expected to obey them faithfully. However, this covenant was only a foreshadowing of a new and better covenant that God would establish with His people in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The New Covenant&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new covenant is prophesied in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Jeremiah/31/Jeremiah-31-31.html"&gt;Jeremiah 31:31-34&lt;/a&gt;. God declares that He will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and the house of Judah. This new covenant would not be like the one made with their forefathers when they were led out of Egypt because they had broken that covenant. In this new covenant, God would put His law in their minds and write it on their hearts. He would be their God, and they would be His people. In this new covenant, everyone would know the Lord personally, and their sins would be forgiven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Jesus Fulfills the Old Covenant&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christians do not follow Judaism today because Jesus Christ has fulfilled the Mosaic covenant. Jesus Himself said, "Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/5/Matthew-5-17.html"&gt;Matthew 5:17&lt;/a&gt;). The writer of Hebrews also affirms this fulfillment, stating that by calling the new covenant "new," God has made the first one obsolete (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/8/Hebrews-8-13.html"&gt;Hebrews 8:13&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9bbjW6zGlTc" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;A Better Covenant&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through Jesus, Christians have entered into a better covenant. This new covenant is superior to the old covenant because it is established on better promises and has a better sacrifice. In the old covenant, sacrifices had to be made repeatedly for the forgiveness of sins. However, in the new covenant, Jesus' sacrificial death on the cross serves as the ultimate and final atonement for sin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Access to God&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the old covenant, only the high priest could enter the Most Holy Place in the temple once a year to make atonement for the people's sins. However, in the new covenant, all believers have direct access to God through Jesus Christ. The writer of Hebrews encourages believers to draw near to God with confidence because of the blood of Jesus that cleanses them from guilt and gives them assurance of faith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Holding Unswervingly to Hope&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Christians, we are called to hold unswervingly to the hope we profess. This hope is grounded in the faithfulness of God and the promises of the new covenant. The writer of Hebrews urges believers to persevere in their faith, knowing that Christ is a faithful high priest who intercedes for them before God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the relationship between Jesus, Jews, Christians, and Judaism is crucial for Christians as it helps us grasp the significance of Jesus' life, death, and resurrection. It reveals how Jesus fulfilled the law and established a new covenant that offers forgiveness, direct access to God, and eternal hope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Think About It&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consider how the new covenant through Jesus Christ provides a greater understanding of God's love and grace compared to the old covenant.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question of Jesus' ethnicity may seem straightforward, but it is not without controversy. The biblical record affirms that Jesus was indeed a Jew. Let's explore what the Bible has to say on this matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Jesus' Jewish Lineage and Life&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question of Jesus' ethnicity may seem straightforward, but it is not without controversy. The biblical record affirms that Jesus was indeed a Jew. Let's explore what the Bible has to say on this matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Jesus' Jewish Lineage and Life&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Jesus' time, Jewish identity was determined by being born to a Jewish mother or through formal conversion to Judaism. Jesus fulfilled both criteria. He was born in Judah to a Jewish mother and raised in a Jewish household in Galilee. Throughout His ministry, Jesus taught in Jerusalem, the Jewish capital, and ministered to the Jewish people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Biblical Record&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biblical record provides evidence of Jesus' Jewish heritage. The Gospel of Matthew begins with a genealogy that traces Jesus' lineage back to Abraham and King David. This establishes His rightful claim to the Jewish throne. Additionally, the angel Gabriel proclaimed that Jesus would inherit the throne of David and reign over Jacob's descendants forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the author of Hebrews confirms that Jesus descended from Judah, one of Jacob's sons. This lineage establishes Jesus' connection to the tribe of Judah and his fulfillment of messianic prophecies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Jesus' Observance of Jewish Customs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus lived a Jewish lifestyle and observed Jewish customs and traditions. He grew up in a devout Jewish home where His parents faithfully followed the requirements of the law. Throughout His ministry, Jesus taught in synagogues and even in the temple. He acknowledged the authority of the Law and the Prophets and taught others to keep the commandments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus actively participated in significant Jewish feasts such as Passover, the Feast of Tabernacles, and Hanukkah. He was recognized as the King of the Jews during His crucifixion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Messiah and Jesus' Mission&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Old Testament prophecies, the Messiah was chosen by God to redeem Israel and rule from Zion, bringing peace, righteousness, and security to the Jewish people. Jesus, as the Jewish Messiah and the Son of David, was sent specifically to the Jews. In His earthly ministry, Jesus focused on reaching the lost sheep of Israel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, through His death and resurrection, Jesus secured salvation for all who would trust in Him, regardless of their nationality or background. The Jewish Messiah became the Savior for people worldwide. This expansion of salvation is highlighted in the New Testament book of Ephesians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding Jesus as a Jew highlights the historical and cultural context in which He lived and ministered. It deepens our appreciation for His fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies and His connection to the Jewish people. Recognizing Jesus' Jewish identity also helps us grasp the significance of His role as the Messiah and Savior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider the profound implications of Jesus' Jewish heritage. Reflect on how His fulfillment of messianic prophecies and His identification with the Jewish people demonstrate God's faithfulness to His promises throughout history. How does this deepen your understanding of Jesus' mission and impact your own faith journey?&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Jesus Christ/The Person of Jesus/Jesus’ Religion"></category><category term="null"></category></entry><entry><title>Was Jesus a Christian?

&lt;p&gt;It may sound strange to say, but no, Jesus was not a Christian. While Jesus is the foundation for the Christian faith, He Himself could not be called a Christian. Christianity is built upon His identity as the Son of God, His perfect life, and His substitutionary death and resurrection for the forgiveness of sins. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus did not come into the world to start another religion. He came to complete the work of God in redeeming sinful mankind. He came to defeat our enemy, Satan. He came to seek and save the lost. He came to fulfill the righteous requirements of the law. He came to establish a new covenant between God and mankind. He came "to redeem us from all wickedness and to purify for himself a people that are his very own, eager to do what is good." &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christianity is the result of Christ's finished work of salvation, and He now builds His church. Christianity is not a religion in the sense that it is man's attempt to reach up to God; rather, Christianity teaches that God has reached down to man. Jesus, as the second Person of the Trinity, took on human flesh and was literally God reaching out to us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Jesus as a Jewish Rabbi&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-LOG2i9m_f4" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus was not a Christian; He was a Jewish rabbi. Jesus followed the Jewish law that God had given to Moses. He lived perfectly under the law in order to present Himself as a sacrifice without blemish, acceptable under that law. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The coming of Jesus was the fulfillment of God's promise to send His Messiah to rescue His people and reign over them forever. For centuries, God had promised this deliverance and through Jesus, it was finally realized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Term "Christian"&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another reason that Jesus cannot be called a Christian is that the term itself was not coined until after His resurrection and ascension into heaven. Believers were first called Christians in the city of Antioch in Syria. The term means "little Christs" and was originally used in a derogatory way. However, believers came to embrace it as a badge of honor. Christians today should obey the voice of their Master and still consider themselves "little Christs" in the sense that they imitate the Lord Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding that Jesus was not a Christian helps us to grasp the unique role He played in God's plan of salvation. It emphasizes His divinity as the Son of God and the fulfillment of God's promises throughout history. Recognizing Jesus as a Jewish rabbi also highlights the importance of understanding the Jewish roots of Christianity and how Jesus perfectly fulfilled the Old Testament law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Think About It&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider the significance of Jesus being called the Messiah, the Anointed One. How does this title reflect His role as both Savior and King? How does understanding Jesus' Jewish identity impact your understanding of Christianity? Reflect on how you can strive to be a "little Christ," imitating Jesus in your thoughts, words, and actions.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Jesus Christ/The Person of Jesus/Jesus’ Religion"></category><category term="null"></category></entry></feed>

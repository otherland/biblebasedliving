&lt;p&gt;In this article, we will explore the question of whether Jesus drank wine. We will examine various biblical passages and historical context to provide a comprehensive understanding of this topic.

&lt;h3&gt;Jesus' …&lt;/h3&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Did Jesus Drink Wine?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this article, we will explore the question of whether Jesus drank wine. We will examine various biblical passages and historical context to provide a comprehensive understanding of this topic. It is important to note that this article maintains a Biblical, young-earth, conservative Christian perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Jesus' First Miracle: Turning Water into Wine&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One significant event that sheds light on Jesus' stance towards wine is His first miracle, which took place at the wedding in Cana (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/2/John-2-1.html"&gt;John 2:1-11&lt;/a&gt;). During the celebration, when the wine ran out, Jesus miraculously turned water into wine. According to Jewish wedding traditions of that time, fermented wine was always served at weddings. In fact, the master of the feast commented that Jesus' wine was better than what was previously served (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/2/John-2-10.html"&gt;John 2:10-11&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is worth noting that the Greek word used to describe the state of those who drank Jesus' wine suggests intoxication. This same word is used in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Acts/2/Acts-2-15.html"&gt;Acts 2:15&lt;/a&gt;, where Peter defends the apostles against accusations of drunkenness. Therefore, it appears that the wine Jesus produced had the capacity to intoxicate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Jesus and Wine in Cultural Context&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While turning water into wine does not directly prove that Jesus drank it Himself, it would have been normal for Him to do so. In fact, &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/7/Luke-7-33.html"&gt;Luke 7:33-34&lt;/a&gt; highlights an incident where Jesus contrasts His own practices with John the Baptist's abstinence from wine. The religious leaders falsely accused Jesus of being a drunkard. However, it is important to remember that Jesus lived a completely sinless life (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-Peter/2/1-Peter-2-22.html"&gt;1 Peter 2:22&lt;/a&gt;) and was never a drunkard or glutton.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aCoc16iwutg" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We must also consider the Passover celebration, which commonly included fermented wine. The Scriptures use the term "fruit of the vine" when referring to the wine consumed during this feast (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/26/Matthew-26-27.html"&gt;Matthew 26:27-29&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/14/Mark-14-23.html"&gt;Mark 14:23-25&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/22/Luke-22-17.html"&gt;Luke 22:17-18&lt;/a&gt;). Jesus actively participated in drinking from the Passover cup (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/14/Mark-14-23.html"&gt;Mark 14:23&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Wine in Biblical Context&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is essential to view wine in its biblical context. While all Christians agree that drunkenness is sinful, wine itself is not inherently sinful. In fact, the Bible presents wine as something to delight in (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/104/Psalm-104-14.html"&gt;Psalm 104:14-15&lt;/a&gt;). However, there are numerous warnings against alcohol abuse because sinful individuals are more likely to misuse wine than to use it in moderation (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Proverbs/20/Proverbs-20-1.html"&gt;Proverbs 20:1&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is crucial to understand that Jesus' probable use of wine should not be an excuse for drunkenness or excessive consumption. Jesus Himself warns against drunkenness (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/12/Luke-12-45.html"&gt;Luke 12:45&lt;/a&gt;). Therefore, Christians who choose to drink wine should either do so in moderation, never to the point of drunkenness, or abstain entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding whether Jesus drank wine has implications for how Christians approach alcohol today. By examining the biblical evidence, we can gain insight into the proper use and moderation of wine. It allows us to discern between the misuse of alcohol and its responsible consumption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does knowing that Jesus turned water into wine at the wedding in Cana impact your view on the consumption of alcohol?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What does it mean for Christians to drink in moderation and avoid drunkenness?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can understanding Jesus' actions regarding wine help us navigate societal pressures and temptations related to alcohol?&lt;/li&gt;

Unveiling the Truth about Jesus' Riches</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/was-jesus-rich/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-08-25T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-08-25T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-08-25:/was-jesus-rich/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Was Jesus Rich?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout Christian theology, Jesus is considered to be as rich as God Himself, being the second person of the Trinity. He possesses all power, authority, sovereignty, glory, honor, and majesty. However, during His time on Earth, Jesus willingly gave up His eternal riches and most of the …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Was Jesus Rich?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout Christian theology, Jesus is considered to be as rich as God Himself, being the second person of the Trinity. He possesses all power, authority, sovereignty, glory, honor, and majesty. However, during His time on Earth, Jesus willingly gave up His eternal riches and most of the privileges of His deity. He took on the nature of a lowly and humble servant, becoming poor for our sake. By the time Jesus endured the tortures of the cross, His earthly possessions amounted to no more than the clothes on His back that were divided up by the soldiers who crucified Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to note that there are some prosperity preachers today who claim that Jesus was rich during His time on Earth and that God desires to bless His children with material abundance. However, this belief is not supported by biblical truth. A closer examination of the Bible reveals that Jesus and His disciples depended entirely on the hospitality of others as they ministered from town to town. Jesus Himself stated that while foxes have holes and birds have nests, He had no place to lay His head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This false teaching about Jesus' wealth and the idea of a "gospel of greed" has unfortunately gained traction in some churches today. The apostle Paul warned about those who cause divisions and put obstacles in the way of true teaching. He cautioned against those who serve their own appetites rather than serving the Lord Christ by deceiving naive individuals with smooth talk and flattery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus consistently taught about the dangers of pursuing earthly wealth. He warned that those who seek riches fall into temptation and harmful desires that can lead to ruin and destruction. The love of money is identified as a root of all kinds of evil, causing some people to wander from their faith and experience many griefs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New Testament contains numerous teachings where Jesus admonishes the rich and praises the poor. He emphasized that life does not consist in the abundance of possessions and encouraged His followers to store up treasures in heaven rather than on Earth. Jesus recognized the deceitfulness of riches and how wealth can be a stumbling block to entering the kingdom of heaven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GpqOdHV3dmU" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the true nature of Jesus' earthly wealth is important for several reasons. Firstly, it helps us align our beliefs with biblical truth, guarding against false teachings and distorted interpretations of Scripture. Secondly, it reminds us of the sacrificial nature of Christ's ministry and His willingness to give up His riches for our sake. This should inspire gratitude and humility in our own lives. Lastly, it serves as a reminder that our focus should not be on accumulating earthly wealth but on seeking spiritual treasures and storing up treasures in heaven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How does the teaching that Jesus was rich during His time on Earth align with biblical principles?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How does Jesus' example of willingly giving up His riches challenge our own attitudes towards material possessions?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In what ways can pursuing earthly wealth become a stumbling block to our faith?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How does understanding Jesus' poverty during His earthly ministry shape our perspective on the prosperity gospel?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reflect on your own priorities and values regarding wealth and possessions. Are they aligned with Jesus' teachings?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus, the central figure of Christianity, possessed a unique and remarkable character that drew people to Him. Despite not having physical attractiveness, it was His personality that captivated others. Let's explore the key aspects of Jesus' character and how we can seek to emulate His example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Compassionate and Caring&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus was known for His deep compassion. He saw the crowds and felt deep empathy for them, describing them as "harassed and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/9/Matthew-9-36.html"&gt;Matthew 9:36&lt;/a&gt;). This compassion led Him to heal their diseases (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/14/Matthew-14-14.html"&gt;Matthew 14:14&lt;/a&gt;; 20:34) and miraculously provide food for large crowds (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/14/Matthew-14-13.html"&gt;Matthew 14:13&lt;/a&gt;–21; 15:29–39). Jesus' compassionate nature reminds us to care for those in need and offer practical help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Jesus' compassion challenges us to recognize the suffering of those around us and respond with love and kindness. By following Jesus' example, we can make a positive impact on others' lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; How can you show compassion to those around you? Are there practical ways you can extend a helping hand to those in need?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Serious and Focused&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus had a clear mission in life and remained focused on it. He understood the importance of His purpose and the limited time He had on Earth. Jesus approached His mission with a servant's heart, declaring that He "did not come to be served, but to serve" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/10/Mark-10-45.html"&gt;Mark 10:45&lt;/a&gt;). His humility, kindness, and selflessness characterized His entire personality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Jesus' focus on serving others challenges us to prioritize selflessness in our own lives. By seeking opportunities to serve and help others, we can fulfill our purpose just as Jesus did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; How can you align your life with Jesus' mission of serving others? In what ways can you prioritize selflessness in your daily interactions?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Submission to God's Will&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus demonstrated a profound submission to His Father's will. He understood that the only acceptable payment for our salvation was His sacrifice on the cross. In the face of immense suffering, Jesus prayed, "My Father, if it is possible, may this cup be taken from me. Yet not as I will, but as you will" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/26/Matthew-26-39.html"&gt;Matthew 26:39&lt;/a&gt;). Even as a child, Jesus was obedient to His earthly parents, Mary and Joseph (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/2/Luke-2-51.html"&gt;Luke 2:51&lt;/a&gt;). His obedience extended to His heavenly Father as well, learning obedience through suffering (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/5/Hebrews-5-8.html"&gt;Hebrews 5:8&lt;/a&gt;) and resisting temptations without sinning (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/4/Hebrews-4-15.html"&gt;Hebrews 4:15&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Jesus' submission to God's will challenges us to surrender our own desires and align them with God's purpose for our lives. By submitting to God, we can experience growth and transformation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; How can you cultivate a heart of submission to God's will in your daily life? Are there areas where you struggle to surrender your desires to Him?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Merciful and Forgiving&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus possessed a heart full of mercy and forgiveness. Even while suffering on the cross, He prayed for forgiveness for those who crucified Him, saying, "Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/23/Luke-23-34.html"&gt;Luke 23:34&lt;/a&gt;). Jesus' love extended to His close relationships as well. &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/11/John-11-5.html"&gt;John 11:5&lt;/a&gt; tells us that He loved Martha, her sister Mary, and their brother Lazarus. The Gospel of John also refers to John himself as "the disciple whom Jesus loved" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/13/John-13-23.html"&gt;John 13:23&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Jesus' mercy and forgiveness challenge us to extend grace to others and cultivate a forgiving heart. By imitating Jesus' love and forgiveness, we can bring healing and restoration to broken relationships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; Are there individuals in your life who need your forgiveness? How can you extend mercy and forgiveness to those who have wronged you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Truthful and Peaceable&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus consistently spoke the truth and lived a life of integrity. He never violated His own word and was known for His honesty. Jesus declared, "I am the way and the truth and the life" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/14/John-14-6.html"&gt;John 14:6&lt;/a&gt;). At the same time, He exhibited peaceable qualities, avoiding arguments and coercion as He shared His message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Jesus' commitment to truth challenges us to value honesty and integrity in our own lives. By living truthfully and peacefully, we reflect Jesus' character to those around us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; How can you prioritize truthfulness and honesty in your interactions with others? In what ways can you promote peace instead of engaging in arguments or disputes?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Intimate Relationships&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wapXZkU-jFM" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus valued intimate relationships. He invested quality time with His followers, teaching them and guiding them towards eternal truths. Jesus also maintained an intimate relationship with His heavenly Father through regular prayer, obedience, and a deep concern for God's reputation. When Jesus witnessed people exploiting worshipers in the temple, He drove them out, upholding the sanctity of God's house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Jesus' emphasis on intimate relationships challenges us to prioritize meaningful connections with others. By investing time in nurturing relationships and seeking intimacy with God, we can experience spiritual growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; How can you cultivate deeper relationships with those around you? In what ways can you prioritize intimacy with God through prayer and obedience?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Strong yet Meek Leader&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus displayed both strength and meekness in His leadership style. People were drawn to Him wherever He went because of His authority and the way He communicated (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/1/Mark-1-27.html"&gt;Mark 1:27&lt;/a&gt;–28; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/7/Matthew-7-28.html"&gt;Matthew 7:28&lt;/a&gt;–29). His followers marveled at His teachings. Jesus' patient and understanding nature was evident as He endured provocation and remained steadfast in His mission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Jesus' leadership example challenges us to lead with strength, humility, and patience. By emulating Jesus' leadership qualities, we can positively influence those around us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; How can you lead with strength, humility, and patience in your various roles and relationships? Are there areas where you need to grow as a leader?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Patience and Understanding&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus consistently displayed patience, even when faced with faithless provocations. He patiently addressed doubts and questions, providing reassurance and understanding. Throughout the Gospels, Jesus expressed His patience towards His disciples and others (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/8/Matthew-8-26.html"&gt;Matthew 8:26&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/9/Mark-9-19.html"&gt;Mark 9:19&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/14/John-14-9.html"&gt;John 14:9&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/2-Peter/3/2-Peter-3-9.html"&gt;2 Peter 3:9&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Jesus' patience challenges us to extend grace and understanding to others, especially during challenging times. By cultivating patience, we can reflect Jesus' character in our interactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; In what situations do you struggle to exercise patience? How can you cultivate a patient attitude towards others?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Emulating Jesus' Character&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As believers, we are called to emulate Jesus' character traits through the power of the Holy Spirit. When we strive to reflect Jesus' compassion, servanthood, submission to God's will, mercy, honesty, truthfulness, intimacy in relationships, strong yet meek leadership, and patience, we become a powerful witness for Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Emulating Jesus' character enables us to impact the world around us positively. By embodying these traits, we can draw others closer to God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; Reflect on the character traits of Jesus discussed in this article. Which of these traits do you want to develop further in your own life? How can you actively pursue growth in these areas?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, Jesus' character was marked by compassion, focus, submission, mercy, truthfulness, and much more. His example challenges us to live a life that reflects His character, inspiring others to draw closer to God. By seeking to emulate Jesus' character traits through the power of the Holy Spirit, we can bring glory to God and impact the world around us.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Jesus Christ/The Person of Jesus/Jesus’ Character"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>"Unveiling the Sinless Savior: Jesus' Impeccable Nature Revealed"</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/jesus-sinless/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-07-27T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-07-27T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-07-27:/jesus-sinless/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Jesus: The Sinless Savior&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout Scripture, it is evident that Jesus was sinless. His sinlessness is of great significance because it is through His perfect sacrifice that we have hope of eternal life in heaven. Let us explore this truth and understand its implications for our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Inherited Sin …&lt;/h3&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Jesus: The Sinless Savior&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout Scripture, it is evident that Jesus was sinless. His sinlessness is of great significance because it is through His perfect sacrifice that we have hope of eternal life in heaven. Let us explore this truth and understand its implications for our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Inherited Sin Nature&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The entrance of sin into the world can be traced back to Adam and Eve's disobedience in the Garden of Eden (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/3/Genesis-3-6.html"&gt;Genesis 3:6&lt;/a&gt;). As a result, sin became a part of human nature, and we are all born with a sinful inclination (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/5/Romans-5-12.html"&gt;Romans 5:12&lt;/a&gt;–19). This sinful nature separates us from God and leads to physical and eternal death (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/6/Romans-6-23.html"&gt;Romans 6:23&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Sinless Savior&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite being fully human, Jesus Christ lived a life without sin. He experienced temptation in every way, just as we do, yet never succumbed to it (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/4/Hebrews-4-15.html"&gt;Hebrews 4:15&lt;/a&gt;). The apostle Peter affirmed this truth when he said, "He committed no sin and no deceit was found in His mouth" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-Peter/2/1-Peter-2-22.html"&gt;1 Peter 2:22&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is essential to recognize that Jesus Christ is not only fully human but also fully God. As the Son of God, He possesses a divine nature that is incapable of sinning. This divine aspect of His being ensures His sinlessness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Need for Forgiveness&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our sinful nature creates a barrier between us and our Creator. In order to be reconciled with God, forgiveness is necessary. However, forgiveness requires the shedding of blood (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/9/Hebrews-9-22.html"&gt;Hebrews 9:22&lt;/a&gt;). While animal sacrifices in the Old Testament temporarily covered sins, they could never completely remove them (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/10/Hebrews-10-4.html"&gt;Hebrews 10:4&lt;/a&gt;, 11).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These animal sacrifices were a foreshadowing of the perfect and ultimate sacrifice that Jesus Christ would make. Without sin in His own life, Jesus was able to offer Himself as the perfect sacrifice for the forgiveness of sins. This sacrificial act on the cross at Calvary paid the full penalty for the sins of all who believe in Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Perfect Sacrifice&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oqUu3-FatsE" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus' sinless nature and sacrificial death provided the means for our reconciliation with God. Just as sin entered the world through one man, Adam, God was able to redeem the world through one man—the sinless Jesus Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shedding of Jesus' blood on the cross was a necessary requirement for forgiveness. This sacrifice, made once for all, superseded the temporary animal sacrifices of the Old Testament (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/7/Hebrews-7-27.html"&gt;Hebrews 7:27&lt;/a&gt;; 10:10). By offering Himself as a spotless Lamb without blemish or defect, Jesus became our redeemer (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-Peter/1/1-Peter-1-18.html"&gt;1 Peter 1:18&lt;/a&gt;–19).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the sinlessness of Jesus is crucial for our faith. It confirms His divine nature and establishes His credibility as our Savior. If Jesus had sinned, He would not have been a suitable sacrifice for our sins, and we would be left without hope. However, because Jesus lived a sinless life, His death on the cross provided the way for our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recognizing and embracing Jesus' sinlessness also invites us to examine our own lives. We are called to follow His example and strive to live lives that are free from sin, even though we may fall short at times. Jesus' sinlessness serves as an inspiration and encouragement for us to pursue holiness in our daily lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus' sinlessness poses a challenge for us to consider. If Jesus was able to resist temptation and live a sinless life, what does that say about our own ability to overcome sin? While we may stumble and fall, we can take comfort in knowing that Jesus understands our struggles and offers us forgiveness and grace when we repent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we reflect on the sinlessness of Jesus, let us be reminded of the incredible love and sacrifice He made on our behalf. Jesus' sinless nature qualifies Him as the perfect Savior, offering us forgiveness and the opportunity for eternal life. May we respond to His grace with gratitude and strive to emulate His example in our own lives.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Jesus Christ/The Person of Jesus/Jesus’ Character"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>'Jesus the Ultimate Pacifist: Embracing Nonviolence in Christian Faith'</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/jesus-pacifist/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-06-28T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-06-28T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-06-28:/jesus-pacifist/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Jesus as a Non-Violent Figure&lt;/h2&gt;

However, it is important to note that the Bible also acknowledges that there are times …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Jesus as a Non-Violent Figure&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus is often described as a pacifist, someone who opposes violence and war for any purpose. His message during His time on Earth emphasized non-violence and love for one's enemies. However, it is important to note that the Bible also acknowledges that there are times when war may be necessary. So, while Jesus can be seen as a figure of peace, it is not accurate to label Him solely as a pacifist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Jesus' Non-Violent Message&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Bible, Jesus teaches His followers to turn the other cheek and to love their enemies (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/5/Matthew-5-38.html"&gt;Matthew 5:38&lt;/a&gt;–44). These teachings emphasize forgiveness and non-retaliation. Jesus encourages His disciples to pursue peaceful resolutions and to respond to hostility with kindness and compassion. His non-violent approach is evident in His interactions with people, including the Roman centurion whom He commended for his faith (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/8/Matthew-8-5.html"&gt;Matthew 8:5&lt;/a&gt;–13). Jesus did not tell the centurion to leave the army, indicating that He was not advocating for pacifism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Instances of Violence in Prophecy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Jesus' earthly ministry focused on non-violence, the Bible also contains prophecies that depict Him engaging in violence. In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Revelation/19/Revelation-19-15.html"&gt;Revelation 19:15&lt;/a&gt;, it is written that Jesus will come with a sharp sword to strike down nations and rule them with an iron scepter. This imagery suggests a future war against the forces of evil. Additionally, &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Revelation/19/Revelation-19-13.html"&gt;Revelation 19:13&lt;/a&gt; mentions that Jesus' robe will be "dipped in blood," further alluding to a violent conflict. These prophecies indicate that there will be a time when violence becomes necessary in establishing Jesus' millennial kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Disciples and Weapons&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contrary to the idea that Jesus was a pacifist, His disciples were recorded as owning weapons. On the night of His betrayal, Jesus instructed His followers to bring swords, and they had two (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/22/Luke-22-37.html"&gt;Luke 22:37&lt;/a&gt;–39). Jesus did not condemn their ownership of weapons but rather cautioned against their misuse. When Peter attempted to use his sword during Jesus' arrest, Jesus healed the injured man and told Peter to put away his weapon (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/18/John-18-10.html"&gt;John 18:10-11&lt;/a&gt;). This interaction suggests that Jesus acknowledged the presence of weapons among His disciples but did not endorse violence as a means to achieve His mission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Balance of Life's Activities&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book of Ecclesiastes presents a balanced view of life's activities, including times for killing, tearing down, war, and peace (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Ecclesiastes/3/Ecclesiastes-3-1.html"&gt;Ecclesiastes 3:1&lt;/a&gt;, 3, 8). These verses demonstrate that there are moments when conflict and even war are appropriate responses to certain situations. They emphasize that being a follower of Jesus does not require pacifism but rather calls for standing against evil and pursuing righteousness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Conflict in Pursuit of Truth&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus Himself stated that He came not to bring peace but a sword (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/10/Matthew-10-34.html"&gt;Matthew 10:34&lt;/a&gt;–36). This statement does not advocate for warfare but rather highlights the potential conflict that arises when truth confronts opposing ideologies. Jesus openly challenged the religious and political leaders of His time because they were not seeking God's righteousness (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/13/Luke-13-31.html"&gt;Luke 13:31&lt;/a&gt;–32; 19:45–47). His willingness to engage in conflict when necessary shows that He prioritized truth over maintaining peace at any cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_kMYx3Eunmg" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;God's Role in Warfare&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout the Old Testament, there are numerous instances where God used His people in warfare to bring judgment upon nations whose sin had reached its full measure. For example, before the battle of Jericho, Joshua encountered "the commander of the army of the Lord," who held a drawn sword (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Joshua/5/Joshua-5-13.html"&gt;Joshua 5:13-14&lt;/a&gt;). This figure is believed to be the pre-incarnate Christ. These accounts demonstrate that God is not a pacifist and intervenes in human affairs when necessary to execute justice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding Jesus' stance on violence is crucial for Christians as they navigate moral and ethical dilemmas related to war and conflict. While Jesus taught non-violence and love for enemies, the Bible also acknowledges that there are times when war may be justified. This recognition helps Christians discern when it is appropriate to engage in warfare in defense of justice and the protection of innocent lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Think About It&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does Jesus' emphasis on non-violence impact your understanding of conflict resolution and forgiveness in your own life?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In what situations do you think it is justifiable for Christians to participate in warfare? How can you reconcile this with Jesus' teachings?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reflect on the balance between pursuing peace and standing against evil in the world. How can you actively promote peace while also opposing injustice and oppression?&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this article, we will explore the question of whether Jesus ate meat. We will examine various passages from the Bible to understand the context and draw conclusions based on biblical teachings. It is important to note that throughout this discussion, we will maintain a biblical, young-earth, conservative Christian perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Permission to Eat Meat&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/9/Genesis-9-3.html"&gt;Genesis 9:3&lt;/a&gt; is the first mention of eating meat in the Bible. After the Flood, God told Noah, “Everything that lives and moves about will be food for you. Just as I gave you the green plants, I now give you everything.” This verse clearly indicates that God granted permission to eat meat after the Flood. The Old Testament also provides numerous instances where meat eating was considered normal and acceptable. For example, the Passover lamb (Exodus 12) and the provision of quail in the wilderness (Exodus 16) were both instances where meat was consumed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oicQeehbvJ0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Daniel's Vegetarian Diet&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some may argue that Daniel and his three friends' decision to eat only vegetables in Babylon (Daniel 1) suggests a vegetarian lifestyle. However, it is important to understand the context of their situation. Daniel and his friends were captives in a foreign land, and there was no guarantee that the meat they were offered would have been considered clean according to the Mosaic law. Therefore, their choice to stick to a vegetable diet was likely due to concerns about following the dietary laws rather than a rejection of meat eating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Jesus' Consumption of Fish&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus' own actions provide evidence that He ate meat. In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/24/Luke-24-41.html"&gt;Luke 24:41&lt;/a&gt;–43, Jesus ate fish. He also served fish to His followers (Matthew 14), and on two occasions, He even caused fishermen's nets to be filled with fish (Luke 5 and John 21). The purpose of catching these fish was for sale and consumption. Additionally, Jesus cooked fish for His disciples (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/21/John-21-9.html"&gt;John 21:9&lt;/a&gt;). These instances clearly indicate that Jesus was not opposed to eating meat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Feast of Passover&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another strong piece of evidence comes from Jesus' observance of the annual Feast of Passover. The lamb sacrificed at Passover time was roasted and eaten as part of the requirements of the law (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Exodus/12/Exodus-12-8.html"&gt;Exodus 12:8&lt;/a&gt;). Jesus took part in the feast every year as a child (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/2/Luke-2-41.html"&gt;Luke 2:41&lt;/a&gt;), and as an adult, He continued to observe the law. Jesus attended Passover in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/2/John-2-13.html"&gt;John 2:13&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/5/John-5-1.html"&gt;John 5:1&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/26/Matthew-26-17.html"&gt;Matthew 26:17&lt;/a&gt;–30. It is important to note that if Jesus had not eaten the Passover meal, He would have been in disobedience to the Law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Jesus' Teaching on Clean and Unclean Foods&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark tells us that Jesus declared all foods to be clean (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/7/Mark-7-19.html"&gt;Mark 7:19&lt;/a&gt;). This declaration was made in the context of a discussion about ceremonial washing of hands. The distinction between clean and unclean foods in the Mosaic law was related to animals, not plants. When Jesus declared all foods clean, it meant that more animals were now allowed for consumption. This teaching from Jesus aligns with Paul's later statements in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/14/Romans-14-2.html"&gt;Romans 14:2&lt;/a&gt;–3 and verse 14. These verses emphasize that no food is unclean in itself and that individual dietary choices should not lead to judgment or condemnation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Misconceptions About Jesus' Vegetarianism&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent years, some groups have claimed that Jesus was a vegetarian based on their interpretation of His teachings on kindness and compassion. They argue that modern methods of raising and slaughtering animals are inherently cruel, and therefore, abstaining from meat should be practiced. However, it is important to note that the humane treatment of animals is a separate issue from whether or not Jesus ate meat. There is no biblical evidence to support the claim that Jesus advocated for vegetarianism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding whether Jesus ate meat has implications for how we interpret and apply biblical teachings. It helps us understand the cultural and historical context in which Jesus lived and how He interacted with the dietary practices of His time. It also provides insight into the significance of the Passover meal and its fulfillment in Jesus' life and ministry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reflecting on this topic can lead to deeper contemplation of our own dietary choices and how they align with biblical principles. It is important to approach discussions on diet with respect for differing convictions and to prioritize unity within the body of Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, based on biblical evidence, it is clear that Jesus did eat meat. Multiple passages support this conclusion, including God's permission to eat meat after the Flood, Jesus' consumption of fish, His observance of the Feast of Passover, and His teaching that all foods are clean. While there may be debates about dietary choices today, it is important to understand the biblical context and teachings regarding meat eating.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Jesus Christ/The Person of Jesus/Jesus’ Character"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Could Jesus Have Sinned?

&lt;h3&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question of whether Jesus could have sinned is a topic of interest and debate among Christians. While both sides agree that Jesus did not sin, the disagreement arises regarding whether He could have sinned. This article will explore two perspectives: "impeccability" (believing Jesus could not have sinned) and "peccability" (believing Jesus could have sinned but did not). By examining biblical teachings, we can gain a better understanding of this theological question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Impeccability: Jesus Could Not Have Sinned&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the doctrine of impeccability, Jesus could not have sinned. Supporters of this view argue that if Jesus could have sinned, He would still be capable of sinning today because He retains the same divine essence He had while living on earth. As the God-Man, Jesus remains fully divine and fully human, inseparably united in one person. To believe that Jesus could sin would imply that God Himself could sin, which goes against His nature (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Colossians/1/Colossians-1-19.html"&gt;Colossians 1:19&lt;/a&gt;, 2:9).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus, although fully human, was not born with the sinful nature that we inherit. He faced temptations from Satan but remained sinless because sin is contrary to God's nature (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/4/Matthew-4-1.html"&gt;Matthew 4:1&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/2/Hebrews-2-18.html"&gt;Hebrews 2:18&lt;/a&gt;, 4:15; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/James/1/James-1-13.html"&gt;James 1:13&lt;/a&gt;). Temptation itself is not sinful; it becomes sinful when someone dwells upon a sinful act and considers participating in it. Jesus experienced temptation in a way that aligns with the first definition - suggestions of sinful acts were presented to Him, but He had no inner desire to participate in them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Peccability: Jesus Could Have Sinned But Did Not&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those who hold to peccability believe that Jesus could have sinned but chose not to. They argue that if Jesus could not have sinned, He could not genuinely empathize with our struggles and temptations against sin. However, it's important to note that experiencing something is not a prerequisite for understanding it. God, being all-knowing, comprehends every aspect of sin and temptation. Jesus can empathize with our temptations without having personally experienced each one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus faced temptations in the same three categories that are common to all humans: the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-John/2/1-John-2-16.html"&gt;1 John 2:16&lt;/a&gt;). We see this pattern in the temptations faced by Eve in the Garden of Eden and Jesus in the wilderness. Despite being tempted in every way, Jesus remained perfectly holy. As believers, we too can overcome sin through Christ, no longer being slaves to sin but slaves of God (Romans 6).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MgzlgR3t8kI" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding whether Jesus could have sinned or not has theological implications. The belief in Jesus' impeccability highlights His divine nature and reinforces the idea that God is incapable of sinning. It affirms His sinless sacrifice on the cross as the perfect atonement for humanity's sins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, acknowledging that Jesus could have sinned but chose not to emphasizes His identification with humanity. It demonstrates His ability to empathize with our struggles and temptations, ultimately providing comfort and encouragement for believers facing their own battles against sin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reflecting on this question can deepen our understanding of who Jesus is and how He relates to us. Consider the following questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does Jesus' impeccability affirm His divine nature?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In what ways does recognizing Jesus' ability to empathize with our temptations encourage you in your own struggles against sin?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does Jesus' victory over temptation give you hope in overcoming your own temptations?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By pondering these questions and studying Scripture, we can grow in our understanding of Jesus' nature and the significance of His sinlessness.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Jesus Christ/The Person of Jesus/Jesus’ Character"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>'7 Surprising Instances of Jesus Showing Anger: Revealing His Humanity and Divinity'</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/jesus-angry/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-06-09T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-06-09T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-06-09:/jesus-angry/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Jesus and His Anger&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the Bible, there are instances where Jesus displayed anger. It is important to understand that Jesus' anger was not fueled by selfishness or personal slights; rather, it was motivated by His zeal for God's house and His concern for holiness and worship. His anger had the right focus, targeting sinful behavior and true injustice, rather than being directed at God or others' weaknesses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Right Motivation for Anger&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus' anger had the proper motivation. It arose from genuine and righteous reasons, not from petty arguments or personal offenses against Him. There was no selfishness involved in His anger. Instead, Jesus' anger was driven by His deep concern for God's holiness and the true worship of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Right Focus for Anger&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus' anger had the proper focus. He was not angry at God or at the weaknesses of others. His anger was directed at sinful behavior and genuine injustice. Jesus' desire was to address these issues and bring about righteousness and justice in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Right Supplement to Anger&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Jesus became angry, it was accompanied by grief over the lack of faith displayed by those He confronted. His anger stemmed from love for the people and concern for their spiritual condition. It had nothing to do with hatred or ill will. Jesus' anger was always rooted in a genuine desire to see people turn to God and experience His love and grace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Right Control over Anger&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus never lost control of His emotions, even in moments of anger. He demonstrated self-control and always acted in accordance with God's will. When He cleared the temple of the moneychangers and animal-sellers, He did so in a measured and purposeful manner. Jesus' emotions were always under control, and He never allowed His anger to lead Him into sin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Right Duration of Anger&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OuNwEyP6BvM" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus did not allow His anger to turn into bitterness or grudges. He dealt with each situation properly and in a timely manner. Jesus' anger was always focused on accomplishing God's will, and once the situation was addressed, He moved on without holding onto anger or resentment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Right Result of Anger&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus' anger always led to godly action. When He became angry, it inevitably resulted in righteous behavior and the fulfillment of God's purposes. Jesus' actions were guided by the Word of God, and His response to anger was always aimed at accomplishing God's will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding Jesus' anger helps us navigate our own emotions. It teaches us that anger itself is not inherently sinful, but rather how we handle it determines whether it becomes destructive or righteous. We should strive to have the right motivation, focus, supplement, control, duration, and result when dealing with anger. By following Jesus' example, we can address injustice and sin in a way that honors God and promotes His kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Think About It&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have you ever experienced anger that was motivated by righteous reasons? How did you handle it?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can we ensure that our anger is focused on addressing sin and injustice rather than being directed at God or others' weaknesses?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In what ways can we supplement our anger with love and concern for the spiritual well-being of others?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can we maintain control over our emotions, particularly when experiencing anger?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reflect on a time when your anger led to godly action. What lessons can you draw from that experience?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By examining Jesus' display of anger, we can learn valuable lessons about handling our own emotions and seeking to bring about righteousness in the world around us. Let us strive to follow Jesus' example by having the right motivation, focus, supplement, control, duration, and result when dealing with anger.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Jesus Christ/The Person of Jesus/Jesus’ Character"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Did Jesus Ever Laugh?

&lt;p&gt;There has been a common belief that Jesus never laughed, as traditional portrayals of Him often depicted a somber and serious Savior. However, this notion may not be entirely accurate. While it is true that Jesus experienced immense suffering and was despised and rejected by mankind, it does not mean that He never had moments of joy or laughter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Jesus' Well-Rounded Personality&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Gospels present Jesus as having a well-rounded and magnetic personality. He showed love and compassion for children, carrying them in His arms (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/10/Mark-10-16.html"&gt;Mark 10:16&lt;/a&gt;). It is difficult to imagine a scenario where children would willingly be around someone who never laughed or expressed joy. In fact, Jesus was even accused of being joyful at times (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/7/Luke-7-34.html"&gt;Luke 7:34&lt;/a&gt;). He also told John's disciples that it was not a time for mourning (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/9/Matthew-9-15.html"&gt;Matthew 9:15&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;God's Sense of Humor&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact that humans have a sense of humor indicates that God also possesses a sense of humor since we are made in His image. The existence of creatures like penguins, platypuses, and puppies also suggests that God has a playful side. As the Son of God, Jesus shares the Father's attributes, including a sense of humor. Furthermore, as the Son of Man, Jesus fully experienced the range of human emotions. Laughter is an integral part of life, and denying Jesus' ability to express joy through laughter would be denying His full humanity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Jesus' Sense of Humor in His Teachings&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus often employed humor in His teachings to engage His audience and convey important messages. For example, His discussion about removing the "log" from one's eye is purposefully exaggerated and lighthearted (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/7/Matthew-7-3.html"&gt;Matthew 7:3-5&lt;/a&gt;). Similarly, the image of a camel going through the eye of a needle contains an element of humor (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/19/Matthew-19-24.html"&gt;Matthew 19:24&lt;/a&gt;). Jesus used these humorous illustrations to make His teachings more relatable and memorable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Joyful Laughter Encouraged by Jesus&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Beatitudes recorded in Matthew 5 and Luke 6, Jesus blessed those who weep, promising that they would laugh. He spoke of rejoicing in His parables in Luke 15, where the lost sheep, the lost coin, and the lost son were all found, leading to great rejoicing. Jesus even explained that these stories illustrated the joy experienced by the angels of God over one sinner who repents (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/15/Luke-15-10.html"&gt;Luke 15:10&lt;/a&gt;). This demonstrates that Jesus not only encouraged joyful laughter but also celebrated when people turned to God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Jesus' Serious Mission but Lived Joyfully&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Jesus had a serious mission to accomplish in this world, it does not mean that He was somber all the time. There is no specific verse in the Bible that states, "Jesus laughed," but we know from His complete empathy with humanity and His experience of all emotions that laughter was likely part of His life. Laughter is an essential aspect of human existence, and Jesus fully embraced life in all its richness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding that Jesus had moments of joy and laughter helps us relate to Him on a deeper level. It reminds us that He experienced the full range of human emotions and understands our own struggles and joys. Knowing that Jesus encouraged laughter and celebrated moments of joy also reminds us that Christianity is not solely about suffering and sacrifice but encompasses abundant life and celebration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reflect on your image of Jesus. Does it align more with a serious and somber figure or someone who also experienced joy and laughter?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does the idea of Jesus laughing impact your understanding of His humanity? Does it make Him feel more relatable?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consider the role of joy and laughter in your own spiritual journey. How can you incorporate more joy and celebration into your relationship with God?&lt;/li&gt;

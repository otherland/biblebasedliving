&lt;h3&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scripture records several instances of Jesus interacting with children, demonstrating His love and value for them. These interactions serve as important lessons on faith and humility. In this article, we will explore these accounts and the significance they hold for us today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Jesus Welcomes Children&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One well-known account of Jesus interacting with children is found in Mark 10. People were bringing little children to Jesus for Him to bless them, but the disciples tried to prevent it. However, Jesus rebuked them, saying, "Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/10/Mark-10-14.html"&gt;Mark 10:14&lt;/a&gt;). Jesus not only welcomes the children into His presence but also blesses each one individually. This highlights the importance Jesus places on children and their role in God's kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Jesus' welcoming attitude towards children teaches us the importance of valuing and embracing children in our communities. Their innocence and trust serve as a reminder of the kind of faith we should have when approaching God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; How can we ensure that our churches and communities are inclusive and welcoming to children? What steps can we take to prioritize their spiritual growth?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Healing and Restoration&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bible also records instances where parents brought their ailing children to Jesus for healing. For example, in John 4, a royal official approached Jesus seeking healing for his son who was close to death. Jesus responded by saying, "Go, your son will live" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/4/John-4-50.html"&gt;John 4:50&lt;/a&gt;), and the official's son was healed. Similarly, Jesus cast out demons from a young girl in Mark 7 and from a boy in Mark 9. These miracles demonstrate Jesus' compassion for children and His power to bring healing and restoration to their lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; The healing miracles performed by Jesus reveal His authority over sickness and the spiritual realm. They also show us that Jesus cares deeply about the well-being of children and desires to bring wholeness to their lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; How can we pray for the physical and spiritual healing of children in our communities? How can we support families who are facing health challenges with their children?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Raising the Dead&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Luke 8, we read the account of Jairus, a synagogue leader, who came to Jesus seeking help for his dying daughter. While on their way to Jairus' house, messengers arrived with the news that the girl had died. However, Jesus told Jairus not to be afraid and proceeded to raise the girl back to life. This miraculous event demonstrates Jesus' power over death and His ability to bring hope and restoration even in the most desperate situations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; The resurrection of Jairus' daughter reveals Jesus' authority over death itself. It reminds us that no situation is beyond His reach and that He can bring new life to seemingly hopeless circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/n6n-ALc-S5c" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; How does the resurrection of Jairus' daughter give us hope in difficult times? How can we trust in Jesus' ability to bring life and restoration to seemingly dead situations?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Childlike Faith&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout His ministry, Jesus often used children as examples of the type of faith adults should have. In Mark 10, after blessing the children, Jesus told His disciples, "Truly I tell you, anyone who will not receive the kingdom of God like a little child will never enter it" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/10/Mark-10-15.html"&gt;Mark 10:15&lt;/a&gt;). In another instance, when the disciples were arguing about greatness in God's kingdom, Jesus brought a child forward and said, "Truly I tell you, unless you change and become like little children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/18/Matthew-18-3.html"&gt;Matthew 18:3&lt;/a&gt;). According to Jesus, humility and simple acceptance, qualities often found in children, are essential for receiving the kingdom of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Jesus calls us to possess a childlike faith, characterized by humility, trust, and a willingness to depend on God. This type of faith allows us to receive God's gift of salvation without pretention or hypocrisy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; How can we cultivate childlike faith in our own lives? What aspects of our faith do we need to simplify and approach with greater humility?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Our Heavenly Father's Provision&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Children often rely on their parents for their daily needs, trusting that they will provide for them. In the same way, we are called to humbly depend on our Heavenly Father for provision in both the spiritual and physical realms. Just as children approach their parents with simplicity and trust, we should approach God with the same attitude.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Recognizing our dependence on God and His provision helps us develop a deeper relationship with Him and strengthens our faith. It reminds us that God is our ultimate provider and sustainer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; In what areas of your life do you struggle to depend on God's provision? How can you cultivate a deeper trust in God's ability to provide for your needs?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The accounts of Jesus interacting with children demonstrate His love, compassion, and desire for each person to have a childlike faith. We are called to value and embrace children in our communities, pray for their healing and restoration, and learn from their simplicity and trust. May we strive to cultivate a childlike faith that leads us into a deeper relationship with our Heavenly Father.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The famous children’s hymn "Jesus Loves the Little Children" holds a significant place in Christian worship. This hymn, written by C. Herbert Woolston and composed by George F. Root, conveys a powerful message about Jesus' love for all children. The lyrics are simple yet profound, stating that Jesus loves children of all races and backgrounds because they are precious in His sight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Jesus' Love for Children in the Bible&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept of Jesus loving children is supported by various passages in the Bible. These accounts illustrate how Jesus valued and showed love to children during His time on earth. One well-known story is found in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/10/Mark-10-13.html"&gt;Mark 10:13&lt;/a&gt;–14, 16, where people brought little children to Jesus for Him to bless them. Although the disciples initially rebuked them, Jesus became indignant and said, "Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these." He then took the children in His arms, placed His hands on them, and blessed them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, Jesus performed miracles to heal and restore children's lives. In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/4/John-4-46.html"&gt;John 4:46&lt;/a&gt;–52, He healed a nobleman's son from a distance. There are also instances where Jesus cast out demons from children (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/7/Mark-7-24.html"&gt;Mark 7:24&lt;/a&gt;–30; 9:14–27), showcasing His power and compassion for their well-being. Additionally, Jesus raised at least one child from the dead (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/8/Luke-8-40.html"&gt;Luke 8:40&lt;/a&gt;–56), demonstrating His authority over life and death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Humility of Children&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus taught that we should have the humility of children. In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/18/Matthew-18-2.html"&gt;Matthew 18:2&lt;/a&gt;–4, He called a little child to Him and said, "Truly I tell you, unless you change and become like little children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven. Therefore, whoever takes the lowly position of this child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven." In this passage, Jesus emphasizes the importance of humility and childlike faith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does it mean to have the humility of a child? It means having a faith devoid of ambition, pride, and haughtiness. Children are naturally teachable and have a humble trust in their parents. Similarly, we are called to approach our relationship with God with the same teachable spirit and trust in His guidance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GP8_c0UxmdQ" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding Jesus' love for children is essential for several reasons. Firstly, it reminds us that every child is precious in God's sight, regardless of their background or ethnicity. This truth challenges us to treat children with love, care, and respect, following the example set by Jesus Himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, recognizing Jesus' interactions with children helps us understand His character and heart. He valued children and took the time to bless them individually. This reveals the depth of His love and compassion for all people, especially those who are vulnerable and dependent like children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, Jesus' teaching on having the humility of a child has broader implications for our faith. It calls us to approach God with a childlike trust and openness to learn from Him. Embracing humility allows us to grow spiritually and develop a deeper relationship with our Heavenly Father.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reflecting on Jesus' love for children can lead us to ask ourselves important questions. How do we demonstrate love and care for children in our communities? Are there ways we can actively support and uplift children who may be marginalized or in need? Additionally, how can we cultivate childlike humility in our own lives? What steps can we take to approach God with trust, teachability, and a willingness to learn from Him?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As followers of Christ, it is crucial that we not only acknowledge Jesus' love for children but also embody that love through our actions. By doing so, we can make a positive impact on the lives of children, reflecting the love and compassion of Jesus to the world around us.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Jesus Christ/The Person of Jesus/Jesus’ Friendships"></category><category term="null"></category></entry><entry><title>'Embracing Grace: Jesus'' Transformative Encounters with Sinners'</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/jesus-with-sinners/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-05-21T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-05-21T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-05-21:/jesus-with-sinners/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Jesus Eating with Sinners&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Gospels, we see Jesus repeatedly spending time with sinners and outcasts of society. One notable instance is when Jesus ate a meal with "many tax collectors and sinners" at Matthew's house (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/2/Mark-2-15.html"&gt;Mark 2:15&lt;/a&gt;). This act drew criticism from the scribes and Pharisees, who …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Jesus Eating with Sinners&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Gospels, we see Jesus repeatedly spending time with sinners and outcasts of society. One notable instance is when Jesus ate a meal with "many tax collectors and sinners" at Matthew's house (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/2/Mark-2-15.html"&gt;Mark 2:15&lt;/a&gt;). This act drew criticism from the scribes and Pharisees, who considered themselves righteous and looked down upon those they deemed as sinners. However, Jesus' actions were in line with His mission to seek and save the lost (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/19/Luke-19-10.html"&gt;Luke 19:10&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Pharisees' Attitude towards Sinners&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During Jesus' time, the Pharisees held positions of high esteem in Jewish society. They were strict adherents to the Law and were seen as exemplars of piety. However, they avoided those they considered sinners, such as tax collectors, who were notorious for embezzlement and collaborating with the Romans. The Pharisees believed that by keeping their distance from sinners, they maintained their own righteousness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Jesus' Purpose in Eating with Sinners&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus chose to eat with sinners because they were the ones who needed to know that repentance and forgiveness were available. As Jesus' ministry grew, He became more popular among the social outcasts of society. Since Matthew was now part of His inner circle, Jesus naturally had more contact with these pariahs. It was important for Him to spend time with them in order to reach the lost. After all, Jesus said, "It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/5/Luke-5-31.html"&gt;Luke 5:31&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/w5GXnM_TxSQ" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By sitting at Matthew's feast and eating with sinners, Jesus challenged societal taboos and condemned the legalistic mindset of the Pharisees. He looked beyond cultural norms and saw people's hearts. While the Pharisees disregarded individuals based on their past behavior, Jesus recognized their spiritual need for repentance and forgiveness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Jesus' Compassion for Sinners&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout His ministry, Jesus consistently reached out to those who needed Him. He engaged in conversation with a despised Samaritan woman, surprising even His disciples (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/4/John-4-27.html"&gt;John 4:27&lt;/a&gt;). He forgave an immoral woman in Luke 7, helped a Syro-Phoenician woman in Mark 7, touched a leper in Luke 5, and dined with Zacchaeus in Luke 19. In all these instances, Jesus showed compassion and love to the untouchable and unloved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus came to save sinners. He did not come to condemn the world but to offer salvation (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/3/John-3-17.html"&gt;John 3:17&lt;/a&gt;). Jesus saw individuals beyond their labels and recognized their need for a Savior. The miracles He performed were a testament to His righteousness, and sinners were drawn to Him because of His compassion and sincerity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Lessons from Jesus' Interaction with Sinners&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus' interactions with sinners teach us valuable lessons. First, we should not let social status or cultural norms dictate our relationships with people. Just as Jesus sought out the lost sheep wherever they had strayed, we too should be willing to reach out to those who need to hear the good news of the kingdom. We must not be deterred by criticism or judgment from self-righteous individuals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, Jesus did not require people to change before coming to Him. Instead, He met them where they were and extended grace to them in their circumstances. Change would come from the inside out for those who accepted Christ. As believers, we should follow Jesus' example by showing kindness and compassion, understanding that it is God's kindness that leads people to repentance (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/2/Romans-2-4.html"&gt;Romans 2:4&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding Jesus' interactions with sinners is important because it challenges us to examine our own attitudes towards those we may consider as sinners or outcasts. We are called to love and show compassion to all people, just as Jesus did. By following His example, we can be effective ambassadors for Christ and bring the message of salvation to those who need it most.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reflect on how Jesus' interactions with sinners challenge your own attitudes towards those who may be considered outcasts in society.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are there any individuals or groups of people that you tend to avoid or judge? How can you show them the love and compassion of Christ?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consider how Jesus' approach to evangelism differs from the legalistic mindset of the Pharisees. How can you adopt a similar approach in sharing the gospel with others?&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus' treatment of women during His time on earth was revolutionary and counter-cultural. In a society where women were often marginalized and considered second-class citizens, Jesus shattered these prejudices and elevated the status of women to unprecedented heights. This article will explore the ways in which Jesus valued and empowered women, as well as the implications of His teachings for Christians today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Value of Women in God's Plan&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus' elevation of women began even before He was born. God chose a woman, Mary, to be the mother of His Son, entrusting her with the most important message the world has ever received (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/1/Luke-1-26.html"&gt;Luke 1:26&lt;/a&gt;–38). Furthermore, when Jesus was only eight days old, the Holy Spirit revealed His identity to a woman named Anna (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/2/Luke-2-36.html"&gt;Luke 2:36&lt;/a&gt;–38). These instances demonstrate that God recognized and valued women from the very beginning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Jesus' Inclusive Ministry&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout His earthly ministry, women flocked to hear Jesus teach and some even supported Him financially (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/27/Matthew-27-55.html"&gt;Matthew 27:55&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/15/Mark-15-41.html"&gt;Mark 15:41&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/8/Luke-8-2.html"&gt;Luke 8:2&lt;/a&gt;–3). Jesus treated women with the same love, respect, and dignity that He showed to men. He included several women among His closest friends and disciples (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/10/Luke-10-38.html"&gt;Luke 10:38&lt;/a&gt;–39; 24:10; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/11/John-11-5.html"&gt;John 11:5&lt;/a&gt;). This inclusivity was radical for the time. The fact that women are named in the Bible is significant because it challenges the cultural norm that women were not worth mentioning. Jesus' actions shattered these social norms and emphasized the important roles that women played in furthering God's kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Breaking Cultural Barriers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus did not shy away from engaging with people who were considered outcasts or marginalized by society. One powerful example is His encounter with an immoral Samaritan woman at a well (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/4/John-4-4.html"&gt;John 4:4&lt;/a&gt;–26). In a culture where Jews avoided any interaction with Samaritans, Jesus broke down barriers and spoke to her, transforming her life and impacting an entire city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ordhsDeAt60" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another instance that showcases Jesus' treatment of women is His response to the woman caught in adultery (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/8/John-8-2.html"&gt;John 8:2&lt;/a&gt;–11). The Jewish leaders brought her to Jesus, hoping to trap Him with a dilemma. However, Jesus turned the tables on them and challenged their self-righteousness. He demonstrated that everyone is a sinner and that no one has the right to pass judgment on others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Women at the Crucifixion and Resurrection&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During Jesus' crucifixion, women were the last to leave His side and the first to visit His empty tomb (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/27/Matthew-27-61.html"&gt;Matthew 27:61&lt;/a&gt;; 28:1). This displays their courage and boldness, which were a result of the transforming power of Jesus in their lives. In a beautiful display of faith, these women became the world's first witnesses of the resurrection (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/28/Matthew-28-8.html"&gt;Matthew 28:8&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Implications for Christians Today&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus' treatment of women serves as an example for Christians today. When Jesus calls a man or a woman to follow Him, He transforms them into new creatures (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/2-Corinthians/5/2-Corinthians-5-17.html"&gt;2 Corinthians 5:17&lt;/a&gt;). Old prejudices and stereotypes no longer define us. As Christians, we are united by one Spirit (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Ephesians/4/Ephesians-4-5.html"&gt;Ephesians 4:5&lt;/a&gt;), viewing each other as brothers and sisters in the family of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means that men and women should work together in harmony, recognizing the unique contributions each gender brings to the family and the church. There is neither male nor female in Christ; we are all equal in His eyes (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Galatians/3/Galatians-3-28.html"&gt;Galatians 3:28&lt;/a&gt;). This should encourage us to value and empower women within our communities, ensuring they have equal opportunities to serve and lead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding Jesus' treatment of women is crucial because it challenges cultural norms and prejudices that still exist today. It reminds us of the inherent value and worth of every individual, regardless of gender. By embracing Jesus' example, we can create a more inclusive and egalitarian society where both men and women can thrive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider the ways in which you can actively value and empower women within your church and community. Are there any biases or stereotypes that you need to confront and overcome? How can you follow Jesus' example of treating women with dignity, compassion, and respect? Prayerfully reflect on these questions and ask God to guide you in promoting equality and inclusivity.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Jesus Christ/The Person of Jesus/Jesus’ Friendships"></category><category term="null"></category></entry></feed>

&lt;p&gt;The Passover sacrifice in the Old Testament was a significant event that typified Jesus Christ as the Lamb of God. The paschal lamb, which had to be a male without spot or blemish, represented Jesus perfectly. Just as the Israelites applied the blood of the sacrifice in faith, we also apply the spotless blood of Christ to our hearts. In this way, "Christ our Passover has been sacrificed for us" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-Corinthians/5/1-Corinthians-5-7.html"&gt;1 Corinthians 5:7&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Symbolism of Yom Kippur&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some object to considering Jesus' sacrifice at Passover as an atonement because they believe atonement was provided through the sacrifices on Yom Kippur (the Day of Atonement). However, there are two ways to counter this objection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly, Jesus fulfilled the symbolism of Yom Kippur as well. He bore our sins in His own body (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-Peter/2/1-Peter-2-24.html"&gt;1 Peter 2:24&lt;/a&gt;) and tasted death for everyone (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/2/Hebrews-2-9.html"&gt;Hebrews 2:9&lt;/a&gt;). His sacrifice was better than those offered on Yom Kippur because it was permanent, voluntary, and removed sin entirely (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/9/Hebrews-9-8.html"&gt;Hebrews 9:8-14&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EHATEltE3ww" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, Jewish tradition does view the Passover sacrifice as expiatory, meaning it removes sin from God's view. The lamb died under God's outpoured wrath, covering over the sins of the one offering it. This is supported by the medieval Jewish commentator Rashi, who stated that the Paschal blood propitiated and atoned for individuals (Ex. R. 15, 35b, 35a).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Saving Power of the Passover Sacrifice&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the tenth and final plague in Egypt, the Passover sacrifice saved individuals from death (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Exodus/12/Exodus-12-23.html"&gt;Exodus 12:23&lt;/a&gt;). Based on the redemptive offering of the Passover blood, the firstborn were spared. This event can be compared to a king who sets aside indictments against his sons when they present him with a gift before facing his judgment seat. Similarly, God atoned for the Israelites' sins because of their participation in the Passover (Ex. R. 15.12, on Exodus 12.10).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Passover lambs brought atonement to the believing Jewish households on that significant night of judgment and redemption. The mark of blood acted as an atonement for those within the house who partook of the paschal offering and also served as a sign for the destroying angel to pass by the house (Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra, pg. 388).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Jesus: The Lamb of God&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When John the Baptist saw Jesus, he declared, "Look, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/1/John-1-29.html"&gt;John 1:29&lt;/a&gt;). Jesus is referred to as the "Passover lamb" because, like the paschal lamb, He was silent before His accusers (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/53/Isaiah-53-7.html"&gt;Isaiah 53:7&lt;/a&gt;). In His death, Jesus bore the wrath of God, preserved the lives of all who trust in Him, and granted freedom to those enslaved by sin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding Jesus' fulfillment of the Passover sacrifice and His role as the Lamb of God helps us grasp the depth and significance of His sacrifice on the cross. It reinforces our faith in Jesus as our Savior and reminds us that salvation is possible through Him alone. Recognizing this biblical truth enables us to appreciate the Old Testament foreshadowing of Christ's redemptive work and strengthens our relationship with God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider how Jesus' sacrifice as our Passover lamb impacts your understanding of salvation. How does this knowledge deepen your gratitude towards Him? Reflect on how Jesus' fulfillment of Old Testament symbolism strengthens your faith in Him as the promised Messiah. Take a moment to thank God for sending Jesus as the perfect sacrifice for your sins.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Jesus Christ/The Ministry of Jesus/Salvation"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Jesus: The Ultimate Answer for Christian Believers</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/jesus-is-the-answer/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-09-05T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-09-05T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-09-05:/jesus-is-the-answer/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Jesus is the Answer&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The phrase "Jesus is the answer" is often used as a slogan, but what does it really mean? In this article, we will explore the significance of Jesus being the answer to various aspects of our lives. Let's delve into how Jesus restores our broken relationship with God, brings reconciliation, provides forgiveness, offers purpose and meaning, gives us peace in times of trouble, and promises a future of restoration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Restoring our Relationship with God&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When God created Adam and Eve, they enjoyed perfect fellowship with Him. However, when Adam sinned by disobeying God, their relationship was broken and humanity was separated from God. This spiritual death affected all of humanity (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/3/Genesis-3-8.html"&gt;Genesis 3:8&lt;/a&gt;–19; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/5/Romans-5-12.html"&gt;Romans 5:12&lt;/a&gt;; 6:23; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-Corinthians/15/1-Corinthians-15-21.html"&gt;1 Corinthians 15:21&lt;/a&gt;–22). But God had a plan to save us. He promised a Redeemer who would defeat Satan and reconcile God and man (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/3/Genesis-3-15.html"&gt;Genesis 3:15&lt;/a&gt;). The Old Testament gradually reveals this plan, and the New Testament shows us that Jesus is the promised Redeemer. Through His sacrifice on the cross, Jesus atoned for our sins and restored the possibility of relationship with God (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/14/John-14-6.html"&gt;John 14:6&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Acts/4/Acts-4-12.html"&gt;Acts 4:12&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-Timothy/2/1-Timothy-2-5.html"&gt;1 Timothy 2:5&lt;/a&gt;–6).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Reconciliation with God&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The term "reconciliation" refers to God's act of making peace with sinful humanity. Through Jesus, we are reconciled to God (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/2-Corinthians/5/2-Corinthians-5-18.html"&gt;2 Corinthians 5:18&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/5/Romans-5-10.html"&gt;Romans 5:10&lt;/a&gt; reminds us that through Christ, we were once enemies of God but have now been made His friends and given life. Jesus is the answer to our problem of being estranged from God. He enables our sins to be forgiven and makes us children of God (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/1/John-1-12.html"&gt;John 1:12&lt;/a&gt;–13). Jesus mends our broken relationship with God so that we can enjoy fellowship with Him in this life and for eternity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Forgiveness and Purification&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even after we are saved, we still sin and experience the consequences of our actions. Sin keeps us from fully fellowshipping with God. However, Jesus offers us forgiveness and purification. In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-John/1/1-John-1-9.html"&gt;1 John 1:9&lt;/a&gt;, we are assured that if we confess our sins, God is faithful to forgive us and cleanse us from all unrighteousness. Jesus is the one who washes away our daily impurities, allowing us to receive forgiveness and be purified (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/13/John-13-10.html"&gt;John 13:10&lt;/a&gt;). He is the answer to our ongoing sin problem, both now and for eternity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Healing Broken Relationships&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Adam and Eve sinned, they not only broke their relationship with God but also damaged their relationship with each other (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/3/Genesis-3-12.html"&gt;Genesis 3:12&lt;/a&gt;, 16). This brokenness in human relationships has persisted throughout history. However, Jesus is the answer to all types of disharmony. &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Ephesians/2/Ephesians-2-14.html"&gt;Ephesians 2:14&lt;/a&gt;–18 tells us that through Christ, the divisions between different groups of people are destroyed. Jesus came to create one new humanity out of the various divisions and reconcile all to God through the cross. He preached peace to those near and far, giving both Jews and Gentiles access to the Father by one Spirit. Jesus instructed His followers to love one another humbly and sacrificially (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/13/John-13-34.html"&gt;John 13:34&lt;/a&gt;–35) and prayed for unity among His followers (John 17). As recipients of Jesus' forgiveness, we are empowered to forgive others. Thus, Jesus is the answer for healing our relational turmoil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Purpose and Meaning in Life&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apart from a relationship with God, life can feel empty and meaningless. Ecclesiastes laments the futility of worldly pursuits without God. However, in Jesus, we find purpose and meaning. He came so that we may have life to the full (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/10/John-10-10.html"&gt;John 10:10&lt;/a&gt;). As Christians, we are invited to be part of God's work in the world, sharing the gospel and making disciples (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/28/Matthew-28-18.html"&gt;Matthew 28:18&lt;/a&gt;–20). We find true fulfillment in serving and glorifying God. Jesus is the answer to our longing for significance and a life that bears fruit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ra3zc-uGk6Q" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Peace in Times of Trouble&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life is not without its hardships, and with hardship often come worries, fears, and doubts. However, Jesus offers us peace in the midst of trouble. He reassures us that He has overcome the world (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/16/John-16-33.html"&gt;John 16:33&lt;/a&gt;). Through His teachings, Jesus reminds us of God's love and care (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/6/Matthew-6-24.html"&gt;Matthew 6:24&lt;/a&gt;–33). He has given us the Holy Spirit to be with us forever (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/14/John-14-15.html"&gt;John 14:15&lt;/a&gt;–21; 16:7–15). Jesus empathizes with our struggles because He Himself lived a human life in this broken world (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/4/Hebrews-4-15.html"&gt;Hebrews 4:15&lt;/a&gt;–16). By relying on Jesus, we can find peace and endurance in the face of hardships (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/James/1/James-1-2.html"&gt;James 1:2&lt;/a&gt;–5). Jesus is the answer to our fears and heartaches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Future Restoration and Hope&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we look at the brokenness of the world, it becomes clear that it needs repair. Jesus is the answer to this problem as well. He has a plan to fix this broken world. &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/9/Isaiah-9-6.html"&gt;Isaiah 9:6&lt;/a&gt;–7 speaks of how Jesus will establish a government of peace without end. He will reign on David's throne, upholding justice and righteousness forever. Revelation 21 describes a new heaven and a new earth where God will dwell with His people. In this new creation, there will be no more death, mourning, crying, or pain. Jesus promises a future of restoration and fulfillment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding that Jesus is the answer to our deepest needs has profound implications for our lives. It brings hope, healing, and a sense of purpose. Recognizing Jesus as the solution to our broken relationship with God and our broken relationships with others helps us pursue reconciliation and forgiveness. Knowing that Jesus offers us peace in times of trouble gives us comfort and strength. Embracing Jesus as the answer to our longing for meaning and fulfillment enables us to live a purposeful life. And finally, the promise of future restoration through Jesus gives us hope in a broken world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reflect on your own life and consider the areas where you may need Jesus as the answer. Are there broken relationships that need reconciliation? Do you long for purpose and meaning in your life? Are there fears and worries that you need Jesus to bring peace to? Take time to pray and invite Jesus to be the answer in those areas of your life. Trust in His promise to restore and bring fulfillment, both now and in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Jesus Christ/The Ministry of Jesus/Salvation"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>The Sacred Blood of Christ: Unveiling Its Divine Power for Christian Redemption</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/blood-of-christ/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-06-30T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-06-30T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-06-30:/blood-of-christ/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;The Power of the Blood of Christ&lt;/h2&gt;

It signifies that Jesus bled and died for sinners, offering His blood as a means of salvation …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;The Power of the Blood of Christ&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The phrase “blood of Christ” is mentioned multiple times in the New Testament and represents the sacrificial death and atoning work of Jesus on our behalf. It signifies that Jesus bled and died for sinners, offering His blood as a means of salvation. The blood of Christ has the power to atone for an infinite number of sins committed by an infinite number of people throughout history. Those whose faith rests in the blood of Christ will be saved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Blood Offering in the Old Covenant&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Mosaic Law, the blood of animals was used as offerings on the altar of the temple to cleanse sins. The law required that nearly everything be cleansed with blood, and without the shedding of blood, there could be no forgiveness. However, these animal sacrifices were limited in their effectiveness and had to be offered repeatedly. They served as a foreshadowing of the ultimate sacrifice that Jesus would offer on the cross.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BYjhGeAIG6k" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The Once-for-All Sacrifice&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus' sacrifice on the cross was described as a "once for all" sacrifice. His blood, shed on the cross, did away with the need for continual animal sacrifices under the Old Covenant. The blood of bulls and goats could not permanently remove sins, but Jesus' sacrifice paid in full the debt of sin owed to God. When Jesus said, "It is finished" as He was dying, He meant that the entire work of redemption was completed forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Blood of Christ and the New Covenant&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The blood of Christ serves as the basis for the New Covenant between God and humanity. On the night before His crucifixion, Jesus offered wine to His disciples, saying that it represented the new covenant in His blood poured out for them. This symbolized that His blood would be poured out for all who would believe in Him. Through His blood, Jesus fulfilled the requirement for continual animal sacrifices and provided eternal redemption for believers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Power to Purify and Serve&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The blood of Christ not only redeems believers from sin and eternal punishment but also purifies their consciences. It enables believers to serve the living God with pure motives and actions. By relying on the blood of Christ, believers are freed from having to offer useless sacrifices or rely on worthless works to please God. Through the blood of Christ, believers become new creations in Christ and are freed from sin to live a life that glorifies and enjoys God forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the significance of the blood of Christ is crucial for every believer. It reveals the depth of God's love and His plan for redemption. Recognizing that Jesus' blood provides atonement for sin gives believers assurance of salvation and freedom from fear and guilt. It also highlights the importance of faith in Jesus' sacrificial death as the means of receiving forgiveness and eternal life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Think About It&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take a moment to reflect on the power of the blood of Christ in your own life. Consider how it has redeemed you from sin and how it continues to purify your conscience. Ponder the freedom you have in Christ to serve God without relying on useless sacrifices or unproductive works. Embrace the truth that through the blood of Christ, you are a new creation and can live a life that glorifies and enjoys God forever.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Jesus Christ/The Ministry of Jesus/Salvation"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Victorious Savior: Jesus Christ Overcomes Death</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/jesus-christ-conquered-death/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-06-21T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-06-21T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-06-21:/jesus-christ-conquered-death/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Jesus Christ Conquered Death&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The central claim of Christianity is that Jesus Christ conquered death through His resurrection. This sets Christianity apart from all other religions. While other religious leaders may have made predictions about their own deaths and resurrections, only Jesus fulfilled these prophecies (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/16/Matthew-16-21.html"&gt;Matthew 16:21&lt;/a&gt;). His resurrection …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Jesus Christ Conquered Death&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The central claim of Christianity is that Jesus Christ conquered death through His resurrection. This sets Christianity apart from all other religions. While other religious leaders may have made predictions about their own deaths and resurrections, only Jesus fulfilled these prophecies (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/16/Matthew-16-21.html"&gt;Matthew 16:21&lt;/a&gt;). His resurrection was a unique event in history, as no one else who was resurrected before Him remained alive permanently. Jesus' resurrection was a complete and definitive defeat of death itself (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-Corinthians/15/1-Corinthians-15-54.html"&gt;1 Corinthians 15:54&lt;/a&gt;–55).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Resurrection of Jesus&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most significant aspect of Jesus conquering death is His resurrection. Jesus, who was once dead, is now alive (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Revelation/1/Revelation-1-18.html"&gt;Revelation 1:18&lt;/a&gt;). This miraculous event marked the first time in history that someone rose from the dead and did not die again. It is a testament to His power over death and His divine authority. Jesus Himself declared, "I am the Living One; I was dead, and now look, I am alive for ever and ever! And I hold the keys of death and Hades" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Revelation/1/Revelation-1-18.html"&gt;Revelation 1:18&lt;/a&gt;). As the sovereign ruler over death, Jesus' conquest of death is permanent and eternal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Sinlessness of Jesus&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another reason why Jesus conquered death is because He was sinless. In the Garden of Eden, sin brought about a curse upon mankind, resulting in death (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/2/Genesis-2-17.html"&gt;Genesis 2:17&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/6/Romans-6-23.html"&gt;Romans 6:23&lt;/a&gt; states that "the wages of sin is death." However, Jesus was without sin (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-Peter/2/1-Peter-2-22.html"&gt;1 Peter 2:22&lt;/a&gt;), and therefore, death had no power over Him. His voluntary sacrifice on the cross for our sins made His resurrection a logical outcome. As Jesus said, "I lay down my life only to take it up again" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/10/John-10-17.html"&gt;John 10:17&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Gospel and Eternal Consequences&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/F2ZSZ0ZXLGs" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fact that Jesus conquered death has significant eternal consequences for believers. The gospel, which is the good news, is grounded in Christ's victory over death. Without His resurrection, there would be no hope for salvation. As the apostle Paul wrote, "If Christ has not been raised, your faith is futile; you are still in your sins" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-Corinthians/15/1-Corinthians-15-17.html"&gt;1 Corinthians 15:17&lt;/a&gt;). However, because Christ is risen, believers have passed from death to life (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-John/3/1-John-3-14.html"&gt;1 John 3:14&lt;/a&gt;). Through the gospel, Jesus has destroyed death and brought life and immortality to light (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/2-Timothy/1/2-Timothy-1-10.html"&gt;2 Timothy 1:10&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Victory Over Death for Believers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christ's victory over death also extends to believers. In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/8/Romans-8-37.html"&gt;Romans 8:37&lt;/a&gt;, it is stated that believers are "more than conquerors through him who loved us." Jesus is described as the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-Corinthians/15/1-Corinthians-15-20.html"&gt;1 Corinthians 15:20&lt;/a&gt;). This means that just as Jesus was resurrected, believers who have died will also be raised to new life. Jesus Himself assured His followers, "Because I live, you also will live" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/14/John-14-19.html"&gt;John 14:19&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Prophecy Fulfilled&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact that Jesus conquered death is a fulfillment of numerous prophecies in the Old Testament. For example, the psalmist predicted that the Messiah would not be abandoned to the realm of the dead and would not see decay (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/16/Psalm-16-10.html"&gt;Psalm 16:10&lt;/a&gt;). Other prophets also spoke of God delivering His people from the power of the grave and abolishing death (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/25/Isaiah-25-8.html"&gt;Isaiah 25:8&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Hosea/13/Hosea-13-14.html"&gt;Hosea 13:14&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-Corinthians/15/1-Corinthians-15-54.html"&gt;1 Corinthians 15:54&lt;/a&gt;–55).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Defeating Satan and Sin&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Death is a powerful weapon that Satan uses against humanity. However, through His death on the cross, Jesus defeated Satan and his power over death (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/12/John-12-31.html"&gt;John 12:31&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Colossians/2/Colossians-2-15.html"&gt;Colossians 2:15&lt;/a&gt;). With His resurrection, Jesus destroyed the devil's most potent weapon. Satan, the accuser, is now powerless to condemn Christians. Believers will not share in his fate (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Revelation/12/Revelation-12-9.html"&gt;Revelation 12:9&lt;/a&gt;–11; 20:10, 14).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact that Jesus Christ conquered death has profound implications for our lives as Christians. It means that we no longer have to fear death because Jesus has triumphed over it. We can have confidence in our eternal destiny, knowing that through faith in Him, we have passed from death to life. Our hope is not in this world but in the resurrection to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reflecting on the victory of Jesus over death should lead us to gratitude and worship. It reminds us of the incredible love and sacrifice of Christ and the power of God to overcome even death itself. As believers, we can find comfort and assurance in knowing that Jesus has conquered death on our behalf. It also challenges us to live in light of this victory, boldly proclaiming the gospel and living out our faith with confidence and hope.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Jesus Christ/The Ministry of Jesus/Salvation"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>The Divine Significance of the Passover Lamb: A Christian Reflection</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/passover-lamb/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-06-08T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-06-08T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-06-08:/passover-lamb/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Passover Lamb&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Passover lamb played a significant role in the liberation of the Israelites from slavery in Egypt. According to &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Exodus/12/Exodus-12-29.html"&gt;Exodus 12:29&lt;/a&gt;, the Passover lamb was the animal that God instructed the Israelites to sacrifice on the night He struck down the firstborn sons of every household in …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Passover Lamb&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Passover lamb played a significant role in the liberation of the Israelites from slavery in Egypt. According to &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Exodus/12/Exodus-12-29.html"&gt;Exodus 12:29&lt;/a&gt;, the Passover lamb was the animal that God instructed the Israelites to sacrifice on the night He struck down the firstborn sons of every household in Egypt. This devastating event was the final plague that God unleashed upon Pharaoh, ultimately leading to the release of the Israelites from their bondage (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Exodus/11/Exodus-11-1.html"&gt;Exodus 11:1&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To commemorate their deliverance, God commanded the Israelites to observe the Passover Feast as a lasting memorial (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Exodus/12/Exodus-12-14.html"&gt;Exodus 12:14&lt;/a&gt;). As part of this observance, each household was instructed to select a one-year-old male lamb without any defects (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Exodus/12/Exodus-12-5.html"&gt;Exodus 12:5&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Leviticus/22/Leviticus-22-20.html"&gt;Leviticus 22:20-21&lt;/a&gt;). At twilight, the head of each household would slaughter the lamb, making sure not to break any of its bones. They would then apply some of its blood to the tops and sides of their doorframes. The lamb would be roasted and eaten (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Exodus/12/Exodus-12-7.html"&gt;Exodus 12:7-8&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God also provided specific instructions on how the Israelites were to eat the Passover lamb. They were to have their cloaks tucked into their belts, wear sandals on their feet, and hold their staffs in their hands. This was a symbolic representation of readiness for travel (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Exodus/12/Exodus-12-11.html"&gt;Exodus 12:11&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The application of the lamb's blood on the doorframe served as a sign for God. When He saw the blood, He would pass over that particular home and spare it from destruction. However, any home without the blood of the lamb would have their firstborn son struck down that night (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Exodus/12/Exodus-12-12.html"&gt;Exodus 12:12-13&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the New Testament, there is a connection made between the Passover lamb and Jesus Christ. In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-Corinthians/5/1-Corinthians-5-7.html"&gt;1 Corinthians 5:7&lt;/a&gt;, Paul refers to Jesus as the "Passover Lamb." John the Baptist also recognizes Jesus as the "Lamb of God" in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/1/John-1-29.html"&gt;John 1:29&lt;/a&gt;. Peter further emphasizes this connection by referring to Jesus as a "lamb without blemish or defect" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-Peter/1/1-Peter-1-19.html"&gt;1 Peter 1:19&lt;/a&gt;), drawing upon the requirement for the Passover lamb to be without any flaws.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus is qualified to be called the "lamb without blemish" because His life was completely free from sin (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/4/Hebrews-4-15.html"&gt;Hebrews 4:15&lt;/a&gt;). In the book of Revelation, John sees Jesus as a "Lamb, looking as if it had been slain" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Revelation/5/Revelation-5-6.html"&gt;Revelation 5:6&lt;/a&gt;). These references highlight Jesus' sacrificial death on the cross, which occurred during the time when the Passover was traditionally observed (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/14/Mark-14-12.html"&gt;Mark 14:12&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DN4TV98XXbU" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the Christian faith, believers symbolically apply the blood of Christ to their hearts through faith. This act allows them to escape eternal death and find forgiveness for their sins (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/9/Hebrews-9-12.html"&gt;Hebrews 9:12&lt;/a&gt;, 14). Just as the Passover lamb's blood caused God to pass over each household, Christ's applied blood causes God's judgment to pass over sinners and grants them eternal life (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/6/Romans-6-23.html"&gt;Romans 6:23&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The significance of the Passover lamb and Jesus, the ultimate Passover Lamb, goes beyond physical liberation. In the same way that the Israelites were delivered from Egyptian slavery through the first Passover, believers are set free from the bondage of sin through Christ's sacrifice (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/8/Romans-8-2.html"&gt;Romans 8:2&lt;/a&gt;). This freedom is not temporary but offers a sure hope of eternal life (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-Peter/1/1-Peter-1-20.html"&gt;1 Peter 1:20-21&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the symbolism and significance of the Passover lamb and its connection to Jesus Christ helps believers grasp the depth of God's plan for redemption. As Christians, we can appreciate how God's deliverance of the Israelites foreshadowed the ultimate deliverance through Jesus' sacrificial death on the cross. Recognizing Jesus as the Passover Lamb helps us comprehend the magnitude of His sacrifice and the forgiveness it offers for our sins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reflect on the significance of the Passover lamb in both the Old Testament and its connection to Jesus Christ. How does this deepen your understanding of God's plan for redemption?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consider how Jesus' sacrificial death as the Passover Lamb impacts your personal relationship with Him. How does it affect your understanding of forgiveness and salvation?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contemplate the symbolism of applying the blood of Christ to your heart through faith. How does this act demonstrate your trust in His sacrifice and its power to save you from eternal death?&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus is often referred to as the Redeemer in Christian theology. But what does it mean for Jesus to be our Redeemer? In simple terms, a redeemer is someone who sets another person free from bondage, oppression, or some other form of captivity. Jesus, as our Redeemer, rescues believers from the power of sin and brings them into the kingdom of God. Let's explore this concept in more detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Old Testament Background&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea of redemption can be traced back to the Old Testament. Two main words are used to convey the concept of redemption. The first word is "gaʾal," which means "to buy back" or "to ransom." It is used to describe God's act of redeeming Israel from slavery in Egypt. From that point on, the Lord reveals Himself as a deliverer, redeeming people from danger, oppression, captivity, and death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second word is "padah," which means "to redeem" and is associated with an animal being substituted as the ransom price for a person or another animal. This term is connected to Israel's sacrificial system for sin and serves as a reminder that a price or ransom had to be paid for one to be released from the guilt and penalty of sin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Jesus as the Ultimate Redeemer&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the New Testament, Jesus is revealed as the ultimate Redeemer. Two key words are used to express His redemptive work: "lutron" and "agorazein." "Lutron" means "to redeem" or "to ransom" and is used to describe Jesus' mission as a Redeemer. He came to give His life as a ransom for many, paying the price to set sinners free from bondage to sin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word "agorazein" emphasizes the costly nature of God's redemptive work in Christ. Jesus paid the ultimate price for our redemption by giving His life on the cross. He bore our sins in His body, satisfying the debt we owed and securing our freedom from sin and death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hwc2d1Xt8gM" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The Effects of Jesus' Redemption&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The redemption accomplished by Jesus has profound effects on believers. Through His sacrifice, we are justified, forgiven, and cleansed from our sins. We are released from guilt and condemnation, restored to fellowship with God, and set free from the power of evil forces in the world. Jesus rescues us from the terrors of judgment and offers us new life in Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding Jesus as our Redeemer is crucial because it reveals the depth of God's love and mercy for humanity. It reminds us that we were once separated from God because of our sins but have been reconciled to Him through the work of Jesus. Recognizing Jesus as our Redeemer also gives us hope and assurance of eternal life, knowing that He has secured our future redemption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take a moment to reflect on Jesus' role as your Redeemer. Consider the price He paid to set you free from sin and the abundant life He offers you. How does this understanding of Jesus' redemption impact your daily life? How can you express gratitude for His redeeming work in your life?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, Jesus is the ultimate Redeemer who sets believers free from bondage to sin and brings them into the kingdom of God. This concept of redemption has its roots in the Old Testament, where God repeatedly acts as a deliverer and redeemer for His people. Understanding Jesus as our Redeemer helps us grasp the depth of God's love for us and provides hope for our future redemption. May we always remember and rejoice in the deliverance and freedom that Jesus, our Redeemer, provides.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Jesus Christ/The Ministry of Jesus/Salvation"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Jesus Saves: The Ultimate Redemption Story Unveiled</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/jesus-saves/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-04-14T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-04-14T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-04-14:/jesus-saves/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Jesus Saves&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The phrase "Jesus saves" is often seen on bumper stickers, signs at athletic events, and banners pulled across the sky. While it is a popular slogan, many people do not fully understand its meaning. In this article, we will explore the profound truth behind these two words and why they hold so much power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Identity of Jesus&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people recognize Jesus as a man who lived in Israel about 2,000 years ago. He is often viewed as a good teacher and prophet in various religions. However, Jesus is much more than that. According to the Bible, Jesus is God in human form (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/1/John-1-1.html"&gt;John 1:1&lt;/a&gt;, 14). He came to Earth as a true human being (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-John/4/1-John-4-2.html"&gt;1 John 4:2&lt;/a&gt;) in the person of Jesus Christ with the purpose of saving us. Understanding who Jesus truly is lays the foundation for comprehending how and why He saves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Need for Salvation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bible teaches that every human being has sinned (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Ecclesiastes/7/Ecclesiastes-7-20.html"&gt;Ecclesiastes 7:20&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/3/Romans-3-23.html"&gt;Romans 3:23&lt;/a&gt;). Sin involves any thought, word, or deed that contradicts God's perfect and holy character. Because of our sin, we are separated from God and deserving of His judgment (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/3/John-3-18.html"&gt;John 3:18&lt;/a&gt;, 36). As a perfectly just God, He cannot allow sin to go unpunished. Since all sin ultimately goes against Him (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/51/Psalm-51-4.html"&gt;Psalm 51:4&lt;/a&gt;), only an infinite and eternal punishment is sufficient. Eternal death, which is separation from God, is the just punishment for sin. This is why we need to be saved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Salvation Plan&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because we have sinned against an infinite God, there are only two options for justice. Either each one of us as finite individuals would have to pay for our sins for an infinite amount of time, or an infinite Person (Jesus) must pay for our sins once. Jesus saves us by taking our place and dying for our sins. He sacrificed Himself on our behalf, paying the infinite and eternal penalty that only He could pay (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/2-Corinthians/5/2-Corinthians-5-21.html"&gt;2 Corinthians 5:21&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-John/2/1-John-2-2.html"&gt;1 John 2:2&lt;/a&gt;). Jesus took the punishment we deserved in order to save us from an eternal destiny separated from God. His act of love led Him to lay down His life (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/15/John-15-13.html"&gt;John 15:13&lt;/a&gt;) and pay the penalty we had earned but could not pay. Three days later, Jesus rose from the dead, demonstrating the sufficiency of His death to pay for our sins and His victory over death on our behalf (1 Corinthians 15).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Receiving Salvation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus saves all who receive His gift of salvation through faith. We need to stop trying to save ourselves and fully trust in His sacrifice alone as payment for our sins (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/3/John-3-16.html"&gt;John 3:16&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Acts/16/Acts-16-31.html"&gt;Acts 16:31&lt;/a&gt;). Jesus' sacrifice was sufficient to pay for the sins of all humanity, but His gift of salvation is received through faith alone (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/1/John-1-12.html"&gt;John 1:12&lt;/a&gt;). We must place our trust in Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/w3yoyaUj-Sg" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding that Jesus saves is crucial because it addresses the core issue of our separation from God due to sin. It offers hope and reconciliation by providing a way for us to be saved from eternal separation from Him. Recognizing Jesus as the Savior allows us to experience forgiveness, redemption, and eternal life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider the significance of Jesus' sacrifice. How does knowing that Jesus willingly paid the price for your sins affect your view of yourself and your relationship with God? How does it impact your understanding of God's love and grace?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, "Jesus saves" is not just a catchy phrase but a profound truth that holds immense power. Jesus, who is God in human form, came to Earth to save us from the consequences of sin. We are all sinners deserving of judgment, but Jesus' sacrifice on the cross offers us the opportunity to be saved. By placing our faith in Him, we can experience forgiveness and eternal life. Understanding and embracing this truth transforms our lives and deepens our relationship with God.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Jesus Christ/The Ministry of Jesus/Salvation"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry></feed>

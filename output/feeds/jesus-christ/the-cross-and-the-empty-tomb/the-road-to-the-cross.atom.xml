&lt;p&gt;The resurrection of Jesus Christ is a pivotal event in Christianity. It is the cornerstone of our faith and holds immense significance for believers. In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/27/Matthew-27-50.html"&gt;Matthew 27:50-53&lt;/a&gt;, we read about the extraordinary events that took place after Jesus died on the …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;The Resurrection of Jesus: A Cornerstone of Christianity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The resurrection of Jesus Christ is a pivotal event in Christianity. It is the cornerstone of our faith and holds immense significance for believers. In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/27/Matthew-27-50.html"&gt;Matthew 27:50-53&lt;/a&gt;, we read about the extraordinary events that took place after Jesus died on the cross. The veil of the temple was torn in two, the earth shook, and rocks split apart. But what is most remarkable is that tombs were opened, and many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep were raised to life. These resurrected saints appeared to many in the holy city after Jesus' resurrection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Power of Jesus' Resurrection&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The resurrection of Jesus testifies to His immortal power, a power that belongs to God alone. In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-Timothy/6/1-Timothy-6-14.html"&gt;1 Timothy 6:14-16&lt;/a&gt;, we are reminded that only God has the authority over life and death. By conquering death and rising from the grave, Jesus demonstrated His divine nature and authority. This sets Him apart from all other religious leaders and establishes Him as the one true Savior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Foundation of Christianity&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The resurrection is not just a spectacular event; it forms the foundation of the Christian faith. Without the resurrection, Christianity would lose its essence and purpose. All other religions and their leaders worship figures who remain dead. Only Jesus Christ has risen from the dead, giving us a reason to proclaim His name and place our trust in God. Our sins are forgiven because of His resurrection, as stated in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-Corinthians/15/1-Corinthians-15-17.html"&gt;1 Corinthians 15:17&lt;/a&gt;. If Christ had not been raised, our faith would be in vain. But because He lives, we have hope both now and for eternity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Fulfillment of Prophecy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The raising of the saints who had fallen asleep in Matthew's account fulfills an Old Testament prophecy found in Ezekiel 37. This connection sheds light on the significance of this event. Just as Ezekiel saw the dry bones come to life, the resurrection of these saints serves as a fulfillment of God's promise. It also points to the coming kingdom and the second coming of Jesus Christ. The raising of only a few saints emphasizes Jesus' power to resurrect and foreshadows the future judgment when all those who have faith in God will be raised to eternal life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/d7eJrtHe49E" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The Urgency of Repentance&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the resurrection of Jesus should ignite a sense of urgency within us. We are called to repent and trust in Him for salvation. Just as Jesus conquered death and was raised to life, we too can experience resurrection and eternal life through Him. This truth is beautifully expressed in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-Corinthians/15/1-Corinthians-15-52.html"&gt;1 Corinthians 15:52&lt;/a&gt;, which speaks of our future resurrection "in the twinkling of an eye." The resurrection reminds us that our time on earth is fleeting, and we must make the most of it by turning away from sin and embracing the salvation offered by Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The resurrection of Jesus holds profound implications for our faith and daily lives. It assures us that our sins are forgiven, gives us hope for the future, and calls us to repentance. By understanding the significance of the resurrection, we can deepen our relationship with God, share our faith with others, and live with confidence in His promises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you fully grasped the power and significance of Jesus' resurrection? How does this truth impact your daily life? Take a moment to reflect on the hope and assurance that come from knowing that Jesus has conquered death and offers eternal life to all who believe in Him. Let this truth shape your perspective and guide your actions as you seek to follow Him faithfully.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Jesus Christ/The Cross and the Empty Tomb/The Road to the Cross"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Jesus Predicts His Crucifixion: The Divine Prophecy Unveiled</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/jesus-predict-his-death/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-08-03T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-08-03T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-08-03:/jesus-predict-his-death/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Jesus Predicted His Death&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus’ death was a significant event in Christian theology, as it served as the ultimate purpose of His ministry and the final sacrifice that paid the debt of sin for all believers (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/9/Hebrews-9-28.html"&gt;Hebrews 9:28&lt;/a&gt;). Throughout the Synoptic Gospels (Matthew, Mark, and Luke), Jesus predicted His …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Jesus Predicted His Death&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus’ death was a significant event in Christian theology, as it served as the ultimate purpose of His ministry and the final sacrifice that paid the debt of sin for all believers (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/9/Hebrews-9-28.html"&gt;Hebrews 9:28&lt;/a&gt;). Throughout the Synoptic Gospels (Matthew, Mark, and Luke), Jesus predicted His death at least three times, with additional predictions found in the book of John.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;First Prediction: &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/16/Matthew-16-21.html"&gt;Matthew 16:21&lt;/a&gt;–23, &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/8/Mark-8-31.html"&gt;Mark 8:31&lt;/a&gt;–32, &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/9/Luke-9-21.html"&gt;Luke 9:21&lt;/a&gt;–22&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first prediction of Jesus' death occurred after He had fed the multitudes. Jesus revealed to His disciples that the "Son of Man must suffer many things" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/8/Mark-8-31.html"&gt;Mark 8:31&lt;/a&gt;) and be rejected by the religious authorities, killed, and then raised again. When Peter tried to dissuade Him from this path, Jesus rebuked him, saying, "Get behind me, Satan!" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/16/Matthew-16-33.html"&gt;Matthew 16:33&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/8/Mark-8-33.html"&gt;Mark 8:33&lt;/a&gt;). Jesus knew that His death was necessary in God's plan to save humanity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Second Prediction: &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/17/Matthew-17-22.html"&gt;Matthew 17:22&lt;/a&gt;–23, &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/9/Mark-9-30.html"&gt;Mark 9:30&lt;/a&gt;–32, &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/9/Luke-9-43.html"&gt;Luke 9:43&lt;/a&gt;–45&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second prediction of Jesus' death came shortly after the Transfiguration. Peter, James, and John had witnessed Christ's heavenly glory, leading them to believe that His kingdom was imminent. However, Jesus told them about His impending death, which greatly confused them. Yet they were afraid to ask for clarification (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/9/Mark-9-32.html"&gt;Mark 9:32&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/9/Luke-9-45.html"&gt;Luke 9:45&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Third Prediction: &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/20/Matthew-20-17.html"&gt;Matthew 20:17&lt;/a&gt;–19, &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/10/Mark-10-32.html"&gt;Mark 10:32&lt;/a&gt;–34, &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/18/Luke-18-31.html"&gt;Luke 18:31&lt;/a&gt;–34&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third prediction of Jesus' death took place as He and His disciples were heading toward Jerusalem for Passover. Jesus explained to them in detail how He would be mocked, scourged, crucified, and then rise again. Once again, the disciples did not fully comprehend what Jesus was saying, as the true meaning was hidden from them. However, they would soon witness the events of Good Friday and the days that followed, which would bring clarity to Jesus' words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Additional Predictions in the Gospel of John&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/t2me51QU00Y" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Gospel of John contains a few more subtle predictions of Jesus' death. For instance, when Mary anointed Jesus with costly perfume, Judas objected, suggesting that the perfume could have been sold to help the poor. Jesus responded by saying, "Leave her alone so that she may keep it for the day of my burial. For the poor you always have with you, but you do not always have me" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/12/John-12-7.html"&gt;John 12:7&lt;/a&gt;–8). Although not an explicit prediction like the previous three, this statement by Jesus clearly indicated His coming death and burial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/13/John-13-33.html"&gt;John 13:33&lt;/a&gt;, Jesus hinted at His time being short as He told His disciples, "Where I am going you cannot come." This statement alluded to His death and subsequent ascension to heaven. Furthermore, in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/14/John-14-25.html"&gt;John 14:25&lt;/a&gt;, Jesus spoke about giving the Holy Spirit in His absence, which implied both His death and the future of the Church.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus' predictions of His death are significant because they reveal His divine knowledge and understanding of God's plan for salvation. Through these predictions, Jesus demonstrated His willingness to fulfill His mission on Earth and lay down His life for humanity's redemption. These predictions also highlight the importance of Christ's sacrifice as a central aspect of Christian faith and theology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reflecting on Jesus' predictions of His death can deepen our appreciation for His sacrificial love and provide assurance of our salvation. By recognizing that Jesus willingly faced rejection, suffering, and death for our sake, we can experience a renewed sense of gratitude and devotion to Him. Jesus' predictions also remind us of the importance of trusting in God's plan, even when we may not fully understand it. Just as the disciples did not comprehend the significance of Jesus' predictions until after His death and resurrection, we can trust that God's purposes are ultimately for our good, even if they may be beyond our immediate understanding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary, Jesus predicted His death multiple times throughout His ministry. These predictions were recorded in the Synoptic Gospels and the Gospel of John, demonstrating His divine knowledge and willingness to fulfill God's plan for salvation. Reflecting on these predictions can deepen our faith and appreciation for Jesus' sacrificial love.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Jesus Christ/The Cross and the Empty Tomb/The Road to the Cross"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Unlocking the Spiritual Journey: 7 Stations of the Cross Explained</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/stations-of-the-cross/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-07-25T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-07-25T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-07-25:/stations-of-the-cross/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Stations of the Cross: A Journey Through Jesus' Sacrifice&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Stations of the Cross, also known as the Via Dolorosa, is a powerful and sacred journey that narrates the final hours in the life of Jesus Christ on earth. This journey continues to provide spiritual conviction for every Christian and offers practical applications to our lives. The Stations of the Cross serve as a stark reminder of the humble manner in which Jesus was willing to set aside any privilege of deity in order to provide a path to salvation through His ultimate sacrifice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several widely accepted versions describing those final hours, one being biblical and the others being more traditional accounts of events in Jesus' final hours. In the traditional form of the Stations of the Cross, there are 14 stations that depict significant moments in Jesus' journey to the crucifixion and beyond. These stations are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jesus is condemned to death.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jesus is given His cross.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jesus falls down for the first time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jesus meets His mother Mary.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Simon of Cyrene is forced to carry the cross.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Veronica wipes blood off of Jesus' face.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jesus falls down for the second time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jesus meets the women of Jerusalem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jesus falls down for the third time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jesus is stripped of His clothing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jesus is nailed to the cross - the Crucifixion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jesus dies on the cross.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jesus' body is removed from the cross - the Deposition or Lamentation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jesus' body is placed in the tomb.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the traditional form of the Stations of the Cross, stations 3, 4, 6, 7, and 9 are not explicitly biblical. As a result, a "Scriptural Way of the Cross" has been developed, which includes biblical descriptions for each station along with their life applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now let's explore the biblical descriptions of the 14 Stations of the Cross and their significance:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1. Jesus is condemned to death&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus prayed on the Mount of Olives for His Father to take the cup from His hand, which meant His death on the cross. This moment demonstrated the humanity of Jesus (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/22/Luke-22-39.html"&gt;Luke 22:39-46&lt;/a&gt;). It is not difficult to imagine how great His anticipation was concerning the events He was about to face. This station teaches us about the importance of obedience to God's will, even in the face of adversity. Jesus' prayer on the Mount of Olives shows us that, as Christians, we should choose God's will over our own, displaying our commitment and obedience to Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; The station of Jesus being condemned to death reminds us of the ultimate sacrifice Jesus made for our salvation. It challenges us to examine our own lives and reflect on our willingness to obey God's Word, even in difficult circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; Are there areas in your life where you struggle to submit to God's will? How can you cultivate a heart that desires obedience and trusts God in every situation?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2. Jesus is given His cross&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Jesus took up His cross, He was carrying more than just wood. Unknown to the many spectators present, Jesus was carrying the sins of mankind and facing the punishment those sins deserved. This action emphasizes the call for Christians to take up their own crosses and follow Jesus (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/16/Matthew-16-24.html"&gt;Matthew 16:24&lt;/a&gt;). Taking up our cross means dying to self in order to live as new creations in Christ, surrendering our will, affections, ambitions, and desires to God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; The station of Jesus being given His cross highlights the sacrificial nature of following Christ. It challenges us to examine whether we are willing to lay down our lives for Christ, surrendering everything for His glory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; In what areas of your life do you struggle to die to self and follow Jesus? How can you actively take up your cross and live in service and obedience to Christ?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;3. Jesus falls down for the first time&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During His journey to the cross, Jesus fell down for the first time. This moment reminds us of the physical and emotional suffering Jesus endured on our behalf. It also serves as a reminder that, as believers, we may stumble and fall in our faith journey. We are called to examine ourselves and ensure that we are truly walking in faith (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/2-Corinthians/13/2-Corinthians-13-5.html"&gt;2 Corinthians 13:5&lt;/a&gt;). The station of Jesus falling down teaches us the importance of perseverance and relying on God's strength in times of weakness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; The station of Jesus falling down for the first time encourages us in our own moments of weakness. It reminds us that even when we stumble, God's grace is sufficient, and He will lift us up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; Can you recall a time when you felt spiritually weak or stumbled in your faith? How did God's grace sustain you during that time?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;4. Jesus meets His mother Mary&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On His way to Calvary, Jesus met His mother Mary. This encounter between Jesus and His mother demonstrates the deep love and compassion they shared. It also highlights the pain and sorrow Mary experienced as she witnessed her son's suffering. This station reminds us of the sacrificial love of a mother and points to the deep love Jesus has for His followers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; The station of Jesus meeting His mother Mary invites us to reflect on the sacrificial love of Jesus and the profound impact His sacrifice has on those who love Him. It reminds us that Jesus understands our pain and suffering intimately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; In what ways has Jesus' sacrificial love impacted your life? How can you show sacrificial love to others in your own life?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/F__HqheNLF0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;5. Simon of Cyrene is forced to carry the cross&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simon of Cyrene, a bystander, was forced to carry Jesus' cross. This moment highlights the physical burden Jesus carried and the assistance He received from a stranger. It also serves as a reminder that as Christians, we are called to join Jesus in His suffering willingly (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/2-Timothy/1/2-Timothy-1-8.html"&gt;2 Timothy 1:8&lt;/a&gt;). The station of Simon of Cyrene carrying the cross encourages us to embrace the call to suffer for the sake of the gospel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; The station of Simon of Cyrene carrying the cross challenges us to examine our willingness to suffer for Christ. It reminds us that suffering can be a means of growing closer to Him and sharing in His mission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; In what ways have you experienced suffering for your faith? How has God used those experiences to shape you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;6. Veronica wipes blood off Jesus' face&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Veronica, an unknown woman in the biblical account, wiped blood off Jesus' face. Although not explicitly mentioned in Scripture, this station symbolizes acts of compassion and love shown towards those who are suffering. It reminds us of the importance of extending kindness and compassion to others, even in the midst of difficult circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; The station of Veronica wiping blood off Jesus' face highlights the power of compassion and love in alleviating suffering. It challenges us to consider how we can extend kindness to those who are hurting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; Can you think of a time when someone showed you compassion or kindness during a difficult period in your life? How did that act impact you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;7. Jesus falls down for the second time&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During His journey to Calvary, Jesus fell down for the second time. This moment serves as a powerful reminder of Jesus' physical and emotional anguish. It also underscores the reality that as believers, we may experience moments of weakness or doubt. The station of Jesus falling down for the second time encourages us to turn to God and rely on His strength in times of struggle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; The station of Jesus falling down for the second time reminds us that we are not alone in our moments of weakness. It encourages us to seek God's strength and grace when we feel overwhelmed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; Have you ever experienced a moment of doubt or weakness in your faith? How did you rely on God's strength during that time?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;8. Jesus meets the women of Jerusalem&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On His way to Calvary, Jesus met a group of women who were mourning and weeping for Him. In response, Jesus cautioned them not to weep for Him but rather for themselves and their children (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/23/Luke-23-27.html"&gt;Luke 23:27-31&lt;/a&gt;). This interaction highlights the importance of prioritizing our devotion and obedience to God over worldly concerns. It challenges us to examine where our focus lies and reminds us of the eternal significance of our faith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; The station of Jesus meeting the women of Jerusalem prompts us to reflect on our own priorities and consider whether we are truly devoted to God above all else. It reminds us that our ultimate citizenship is in heaven, and our focus should be on eternal matters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; In what ways can you prioritize your devotion to God over worldly concerns? How can you cultivate a heart that is focused on eternal matters?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;9. Jesus falls down for the third time&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus fell down for the third time during His journey to Calvary. This moment serves as a poignant reminder of Jesus' physical exhaustion and suffering. It also underscores the reality that as believers, we may face repeated struggles and challenges in our faith journey. The station of Jesus falling down for the third time encourages us to persevere in our faith and rely on God's strength even when we feel weak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; The station of Jesus falling down for the third time reminds us that our faith journey may be marked by repeated struggles. It challenges us to trust in God's strength and grace to sustain us through difficult times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; Can you recall a time when you faced repeated struggles or challenges in your faith? How did you rely on God's strength to persevere?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;10. Jesus is stripped of His clothing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the crucifixion, Jesus was stripped of His clothing. This moment symbolizes the humiliation and shame that Jesus endured on our behalf. It reminds us of the vulnerability and humility that characterized Jesus' sacrifice. The station of Jesus being stripped of His clothing calls us to embrace humility and vulnerability as we follow Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; The station of Jesus being stripped of His clothing challenges us to examine our own attitudes towards humility and vulnerability. It reminds us that true greatness is found in serving others and following Jesus' example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; In what ways can you cultivate a spirit of humility and vulnerability in your own life? How can you serve others with a humble heart?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;11. Jesus is nailed to the cross - the Crucifixion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The crucifixion, the central event of the Stations of the Cross, represents the ultimate sacrifice Jesus made for our salvation. Nailed to the cross, Jesus willingly endured excruciating pain and suffering on our behalf. His death on the cross serves as a powerful reminder of God's love for humanity and His desire to reconcile us to Himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; The station of Jesus being nailed to the cross reminds us of the incredible love God has for us. It challenges us to reflect on the depth of Jesus' sacrifice and respond with gratitude and devotion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; How does contemplating Jesus' sacrifice on the cross impact your understanding of God's love for you? How can you respond to that love in your own life?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;12. Jesus dies on the cross&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus' death on the cross marks the culmination of His sacrificial journey. In this moment, Jesus paid the price for our sins and opened the way for us to be reconciled to God. His death serves as the ultimate demonstration of God's love and grace towards humanity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; The station of Jesus' death on the cross reminds us of the magnitude of God's love and the extent of His grace. It challenges us to respond to that love by surrendering our lives to Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; How does Jesus' death on the cross impact your understanding of God's love and grace? How can you surrender your life to Him in response?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;13. Jesus' body is removed from the cross - the Deposition or Lamentation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Jesus died, His body was removed from the cross and laid to rest in a tomb provided by Joseph of Arimathea. This moment represents the solemnity and grief that accompanied Jesus' crucifixion. It also foreshadows the hope and anticipation of His resurrection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; The station of Jesus' body being removed from the cross reminds us of the reality of Jesus' death and burial. It invites us to reflect on the significance of His sacrifice and anticipate the hope of His resurrection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; How does contemplating Jesus' death and burial deepen your appreciation for His sacrifice? How does it shape your anticipation of His resurrection?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;14. Jesus' body is placed in the tomb&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final station of the Stations of the Cross depicts Jesus' body being placed in the tomb. This moment represents the culmination of Jesus' earthly journey and serves as a reminder of His victory over sin and death. It points to the hope and promise of His resurrection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; The station of Jesus' body being placed in the tomb reminds us of the hope we have in Christ's victory over sin and death. It challenges us to live in light of His resurrection and share this hope with others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; How does the hope of Jesus' resurrection impact your daily life? How can you share this hope with others?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Stations of the Cross provide a powerful and tangible way for Christians to reflect on the sacrifice Jesus made for our salvation. Each station carries deep meaning and invites us to examine our own lives, responses, and commitments to God. As we journey through the Stations of the Cross, may we be reminded of the incredible love and grace that Jesus demonstrated on our behalf. May we respond with gratitude, obedience, and a renewed dedication to following Him wholeheartedly.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Jesus Christ/The Cross and the Empty Tomb/The Road to the Cross"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Unlocking the Mystery of 39 Lashes: A Deep Dive into Biblical Punishment</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/39-lashes/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-07-16T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-07-16T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-07-16:/39-lashes/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;39 Lashes: The Scourging of Jesus&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The crucifixion of Jesus Christ is a pivotal event in Christian theology, but it is often easy to overlook the excruciating torment that He endured before being nailed to the cross. Just before His crucifixion, Jesus was scourged by the Romans (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/19/John-19-1.html"&gt;John 19:1 …&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;39 Lashes: The Scourging of Jesus&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The crucifixion of Jesus Christ is a pivotal event in Christian theology, but it is often easy to overlook the excruciating torment that He endured before being nailed to the cross. Just before His crucifixion, Jesus was scourged by the Romans (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/19/John-19-1.html"&gt;John 19:1&lt;/a&gt;). The Bible does not directly indicate how many lashes Jesus received. However, we can gain some insight into this by examining Jewish customs and practices during that time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Deuteronomy/25/Deuteronomy-25-3.html"&gt;Deuteronomy 25:3&lt;/a&gt;, a criminal should not receive more than forty lashes. In order to avoid possibly accidentally breaking this command, the Jews would only give a criminal 39 lashes. The Apostle Paul mentioned this practice in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/2-Corinthians/11/2-Corinthians-11-24.html"&gt;2 Corinthians 11:24&lt;/a&gt;, stating, "five times I received from the Jews the forty lashes minus one." However, it is important to note that Jesus was scourged by the Romans, not by the Jews. Therefore, it is unlikely that the Romans would have followed this specific Jewish tradition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scourging was a punishment ordered for Jesus by Pontius Pilate. He was to be flogged (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/27/Matthew-27-26.html"&gt;Matthew 27:26&lt;/a&gt;) but not killed in that way. His death was to be carried out by crucifixion after the scourging. The level of hatred and cruelty necessary to subject an innocent man to such a fate is unimaginable. Yet, both the Jewish leaders and Pilate conspired to have Jesus flogged and crucified, despite knowing His innocence. What makes this even more profound is the fact that the man they sent to be tormented and crucified was none other than the Son of God Himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The prophet Isaiah prophesied about the suffering that Jesus would endure, saying, "He was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/53/Isaiah-53-5.html"&gt;Isaiah 53:5&lt;/a&gt;). The "stripes" referred to in this prophecy are a direct reference to the lashes Jesus received during His scourging. This prophecy highlights the incredible sacrifice that Jesus made for humanity. His suffering and the wounds He bore on our behalf were not in vain but served to bring spiritual healing to all who would believe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the extent of the physical punishment that Jesus endured helps us grasp the depth of His love for us. He willingly chose to accept an undeserved, cruel death in order to save His sheep—the people He came to redeem. Additionally, recognizing the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies in Jesus' suffering and death strengthens our faith and confidence in the divine plan of salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take a moment to reflect on the magnitude of Jesus' sacrifice. Consider the physical pain and emotional anguish He endured for your sake. How does this knowledge impact your understanding of God's love for you? How does it inspire you to live a life that honors and reflects His sacrifice?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Terrible Ordeal of Scourging&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether there were 39 lashes or 40 or some other number, the scourging that Jesus experienced was undoubtedly a terrible and painful ordeal. Scourging was a common form of punishment in Roman times, involving the use of a whip called a flagrum or a flagellum. The whip consisted of multiple leather thongs embedded with pieces of bone or metal, designed to cause maximum pain and damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The executioner would typically tie the victim's hands to a post or pillar, leaving their back exposed and vulnerable. The scourger would then strike the victim repeatedly with full force, lacerating their flesh and causing severe pain. The goal was not only to inflict physical suffering but also to humiliate and dehumanize the condemned person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The physical effects of scourging were devastating. The whip's sharp edges would tear through the skin, exposing underlying muscle and tissue. Blood loss, bruising, and swelling would occur, leading to extreme pain and trauma. In some cases, victims would even die from the scourging alone due to the severity of their injuries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Jesus' case, the scourging was carried out by Roman soldiers under the orders of Pontius Pilate. These soldiers were known for their brutality and lack of mercy. They would have subjected Jesus to a merciless flogging, aiming to break His spirit and weaken Him physically before His crucifixion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/m_FnL7mKhFg" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Spiritual Significance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The torment that Jesus endured during His scourging was not just a physical ordeal; it held profound spiritual significance as well. Isaiah compared humanity to a flock of sheep that had turned away from its Shepherd, with each individual going their own way—a picture of disharmony and danger (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/53/Isaiah-53-6.html"&gt;Isaiah 53:6&lt;/a&gt;). But God, in His infinite love and mercy, chose to lay on Jesus the iniquity of us all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus, the pure and innocent Son of God, willingly bore our sins and their consequences upon His own body. Through His wounds and suffering, He took upon Himself the punishment that we deserved. Just as Isaiah prophesied, "the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/53/Isaiah-53-5.html"&gt;Isaiah 53:5&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By His sacrificial death on the cross, Jesus provided a way for us to be reconciled with God and experience spiritual healing. His wounds serve as a powerful reminder of the seriousness of our sin and the depth of His love for us. Through faith in Jesus' sacrifice, we can receive forgiveness and salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recognizing the spiritual significance of Jesus' scourging enables us to grasp the magnitude of His sacrifice. It highlights the depth of God's love for us and the incredible lengths He went to in order to redeem humanity. This knowledge calls us to respond with gratitude, repentance, and a desire to live in a manner that honors and reflects the sacrifice of Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider the wounds that Jesus bore for your sake. Reflect on the spiritual healing and restoration that is available through His sacrifice. How does this knowledge impact your perspective on sin and forgiveness? How does it inspire you to live a life of gratitude and obedience to God?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Good Shepherd's Sacrifice&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scourging of Jesus serves as a profound illustration of His role as the Good Shepherd. In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/10/John-10-11.html"&gt;John 10:11&lt;/a&gt;, Jesus Himself said, "I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep." This statement not only reveals Jesus' willingness to sacrifice Himself for humanity but also emphasizes His deep love and concern for His followers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus, as the Good Shepherd, knows His sheep intimately. He knows each one individually, just as the Father knows Him and He knows the Father (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/10/John-10-15.html"&gt;John 10:15&lt;/a&gt;). This intimate knowledge and connection form the basis for His sacrificial act of laying down His life for His sheep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus' death was not a tragic accident or an act forced upon Him by others. He said, "No one takes it from me, but I lay it down of my own accord. I have authority to lay it down, and I have authority to take it up again" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/10/John-10-18.html"&gt;John 10:18&lt;/a&gt;). His sacrifice was a deliberate choice motivated by love and obedience to the Father's plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the Good Shepherd, Jesus willingly took upon Himself the punishment that we deserved. He bore the weight of our sins, offering Himself as the ultimate sacrifice to save us from eternal separation from God. Through His death and resurrection, Jesus conquered sin and death, providing eternal life for all who believe in Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding Jesus' role as the Good Shepherd who willingly laid down His life for His sheep deepens our appreciation for His sacrifice. It reminds us of the personal nature of God's love and the lengths He went to in order to save us. This knowledge calls us to respond with faith, trust, and obedience to the One who gave everything for our sake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Think About It&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reflect on the love and care that Jesus, the Good Shepherd, has shown you by laying down His life. Consider how His sacrifice has impacted your life and your relationship with God. How does this knowledge inspire you to follow Him and live as one of His sheep?&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Jesus Christ/The Cross and the Empty Tomb/The Road to the Cross"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>The Divine Trials: Unveiling the Journey of Jesus</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/trials-of-jesus/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-07-10T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-07-10T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-07-10:/trials-of-jesus/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Trials of Jesus&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trials of Jesus were a series of legal proceedings that took place before both Jewish religious authorities and Roman officials. These trials ultimately led to Jesus' crucifixion. Let's explore the key points of these trials to gain a better understanding of their significance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1. Religious Trials …&lt;/h3&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Trials of Jesus&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trials of Jesus were a series of legal proceedings that took place before both Jewish religious authorities and Roman officials. These trials ultimately led to Jesus' crucifixion. Let's explore the key points of these trials to gain a better understanding of their significance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1. Religious Trials&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus' religious trials consisted of three stages. First, He was brought before Annas, the former high priest, who questioned Him about His disciples and His teachings (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/18/John-18-19.html"&gt;John 18:19-24&lt;/a&gt;). Next, Jesus faced Caiaphas, the current high priest, and the Sanhedrin, an assembly of religious leaders. In these trials, Jesus was charged with blasphemy for claiming to be the Son of God and the Messiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These religious trials demonstrated the extent of the Jewish leaders' hatred towards Jesus, as they disregarded many of their own laws. Several illegalities occurred during these trials based on Jewish law. For example, trials were not supposed to be held during feast time, but Jesus' trial took place during Passover. Additionally, each member of the court was meant to vote individually to convict or acquit, but Jesus was convicted by acclamation. The Jewish leaders also had no authority to execute anyone, and trials were not meant to be held at night. Despite these violations, Jesus was found guilty and sentenced to death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the religious trials helps us see how Jesus faced unjust treatment from those who should have upheld justice and fairness. It highlights the opposition and hatred He encountered from the Jewish religious leaders, which ultimately led to His crucifixion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Think About It&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider the significance of Jesus being charged with blasphemy for claiming to be the Son of God and the Messiah. How does this reflect His divinity and the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2. Roman Trials&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the religious trials, Jesus was taken before Roman authorities. The first Roman official Jesus faced was Pilate, the Roman Governor (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/18/John-18-28.html"&gt;John 18:28&lt;/a&gt;). Pilate found no reason to put Jesus to death but sent Him to Herod, hoping to avoid responsibility in the matter (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/23/Luke-23-7.html"&gt;Luke 23:7&lt;/a&gt;). Herod ridiculed Jesus and then sent Him back to Pilate (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/23/Luke-23-11.html"&gt;Luke 23:11&lt;/a&gt;–12).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pilate made several attempts to release Jesus, as he did not believe He deserved death. He offered the prisoner Barabbas to be crucified instead of Jesus but was met with the crowd's demand for Jesus' crucifixion. Pilate eventually yielded to the pressure and handed Jesus over to be crucified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;3. Illegalities in the Trials&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout both the religious and Roman trials, several illegalities occurred that violated Jewish and Roman law. These illegalities further demonstrate the injustice surrounding Jesus' trials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KTZfHmrmpAU" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the religious trials, there were violations of Jewish law such as holding a trial during a feast, not allowing sufficient time before carrying out the death penalty, and not providing proper legal representation for the accused. Additionally, self-incriminating questions were asked of Jesus, which was not allowed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Roman trials, Pilate found no legitimate reason to execute Jesus but succumbed to political pressure from the crowd. This goes against Roman legal principles and reveals how injustices prevailed during these proceedings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The illegalities in Jesus' trials highlight the flawed human systems of justice that failed to recognize His innocence. They serve as a reminder of the fallen nature of humanity and our need for a perfect and just Savior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Think About It&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reflect on how the illegalities in Jesus' trials reveal the corrupt nature of human institutions and our desperate need for God's justice and redemption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;4. Scourging and Crucifixion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before Jesus was crucified, Pilate had Him scourged as a final attempt to appease the Jews and secure His release. Roman scourging was a brutal punishment that involved severely whipping the accused, often causing significant pain and damage to the body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite Pilate's attempts to have Jesus released, the crowd insisted on His crucifixion. Pilate eventually gave in to their demands and handed Jesus over to be crucified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;5. Mockery of Justice&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trials of Jesus represented the ultimate mockery of justice. Jesus, who was the most innocent man in history, was found guilty of crimes He did not commit and sentenced to death by crucifixion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The religious trials demonstrated the Jewish leaders' animosity towards Jesus, as they violated their own laws and disregarded fairness and justice. The Roman trials revealed how political pressures influenced the decision-making process, leading to an unjust outcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;6. Significance&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trials of Jesus hold immense significance in Christianity. They highlight the lengths to which Jesus was willing to endure injustice and suffering for the sake of humanity's redemption. Despite the flawed human systems of justice, Jesus willingly laid down His life on the cross to offer forgiveness and salvation to all who believe in Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the trials of Jesus helps us grasp the depth of God's love for us and the sacrificial nature of Jesus' mission on Earth. It reminds us that even in the face of injustice, we can find hope and redemption through our faith in Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Think About It&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reflect on the profound implications of Jesus' willingness to endure unjust trials and ultimately give His life for our salvation. How does this inspire you to respond in your own life?&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Jesus Christ/The Cross and the Empty Tomb/The Road to the Cross"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Unveiling the Truth: Who Killed Jesus and Why?

&lt;p&gt;The question of who is responsible for the death of Jesus is complex and involves multiple parties. While it is true that the Jews, particularly the scribes, Sadducees, and Pharisees, strongly opposed Jesus and played a role in His arrest and condemnation (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/21/Matthew-21-15.html"&gt;Matthew 21:15&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/11/Luke-11-53.html"&gt;Luke 11 …&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Who Killed Jesus?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question of who is responsible for the death of Jesus is complex and involves multiple parties. While it is true that the Jews, particularly the scribes, Sadducees, and Pharisees, strongly opposed Jesus and played a role in His arrest and condemnation (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/21/Matthew-21-15.html"&gt;Matthew 21:15&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/11/Luke-11-53.html"&gt;Luke 11:53&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/5/John-5-18.html"&gt;John 5:18&lt;/a&gt;; 7:45–52; 12:37), they are not solely to blame. The chief priests and elders also accused and mocked Jesus, holding council to have Him arrested and sentenced to death (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/27/Matthew-27-12.html"&gt;Matthew 27:12&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/15/Mark-15-1.html"&gt;Mark 15:1&lt;/a&gt;). Additionally, Judas, a Jew, betrayed Jesus (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/18/John-18-2.html"&gt;John 18:2&lt;/a&gt;), and the Jewish crowd shouted for Jesus to be crucified (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/23/Luke-23-21.html"&gt;Luke 23:21&lt;/a&gt;) and asked for Barabbas to be released instead of Him (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/27/Matthew-27-21.html"&gt;Matthew 27:21&lt;/a&gt;). Therefore, part of the responsibility falls on the Jews who plotted against Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, it is important to note that the blame cannot be placed solely on the Jews. According to Peter's sermon on the Day of Pentecost, while the Jews played a role in Jesus' death, it was ultimately part of God's deliberate plan. Peter says, "This man was handed over to you by God’s deliberate plan and foreknowledge; and you, with the help of wicked men, put him to death by nailing him to the cross" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Acts/2/Acts-2-23.html"&gt;Acts 2:23&lt;/a&gt;). The Romans were the "wicked men" who physically carried out Jesus' crucifixion. They perfected crucifixion as a method of execution and subjected Jesus to torture before crucifying Him. Pontius Pilate, the Roman governor, sentenced Jesus to be flogged and crucified (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/27/Matthew-27-26.html"&gt;Matthew 27:26&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/19/John-19-1.html"&gt;John 19:1&lt;/a&gt;). Roman soldiers mocked Him, drove nails into His hands and feet, and pierced His side with a spear (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/27/Matthew-27-28.html"&gt;Matthew 27:28&lt;/a&gt;–29; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/19/John-19-23.html"&gt;John 19:23&lt;/a&gt;, 34). Therefore, the Romans also share the blame for killing Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1Sm8fi3jodA" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the Jews and Romans played significant roles in Jesus' death, it is essential to understand that God the Father had a purpose in allowing Jesus to die. &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/3/Romans-3-25.html"&gt;Romans 3:25&lt;/a&gt; states that God presented Christ as a sacrifice of atonement through the shedding of His blood, and &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/8/Romans-8-32.html"&gt;Romans 8:32&lt;/a&gt; emphasizes that God did not spare His own Son but gave Him up for us all. &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/53/Isaiah-53-10.html"&gt;Isaiah 53:10&lt;/a&gt; reveals that it was the Lord's will to crush Jesus and make His life an offering for sin. Although God did not physically put Jesus on the cross or pound the nails, the crucifixion was part of God's plan to redeem humanity. Jesus willingly laid down His life to save us from our sins (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/10/John-10-17.html"&gt;John 10:17&lt;/a&gt;–19) and took the punishment we deserved, reconciling us to God (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/2-Corinthians/5/2-Corinthians-5-21.html"&gt;2 Corinthians 5:21&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The death of Jesus was necessary for our salvation because it satisfied God's holy wrath against sin. In Genesis 22, Abraham was about to sacrifice his son Isaac in obedience to God's command, but the angel of the Lord provided a ram as a substitute sacrifice. Similarly, Jesus became our substitute on the cross. His death allowed God to spare us and bring sinners to heaven without violating His justice (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/3/Romans-3-25.html"&gt;Romans 3:25&lt;/a&gt;–26). The atonement of Christ was prophesied in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/53/Isaiah-53-5.html"&gt;Isaiah 53:5&lt;/a&gt;, where it is said that He was pierced for our transgressions, crushed for our iniquities, and by His wounds, we are healed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In light of these truths, it is important to recognize that all of humanity shares in the guilt of killing Jesus. It was our sin that put Him on the cross. Yet, God used this unlawful killing as the means of our salvation. God can use even the wickedest of actions to bring about His perfect plan (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/50/Genesis-50-20.html"&gt;Genesis 50:20&lt;/a&gt;). While sinful people were responsible for Jesus' death, God's response to evil is redemptive and displays His great love for us. As &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/5/Romans-5-6.html"&gt;Romans 5:6&lt;/a&gt;–8 states, "You see, at just the right time, when we were still powerless, Christ died for the ungodly. Very rarely will anyone die for a righteous person, though for a good person someone might possibly dare to die. But God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding who killed Jesus is significant because it reveals the depth of God's love and His redemptive plan for humanity. Recognizing that all of humanity shares in the guilt of Jesus' death should humble us and lead us to acknowledge our need for a Savior. It reminds us of the seriousness of sin and the incredible sacrifice Jesus made on our behalf. This knowledge should motivate us to respond with gratitude and surrender to God's saving grace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reflect on the fact that Jesus willingly laid down His life for you. How does this impact your understanding of His love for you?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consider the role you play in Jesus' death due to your sin. How does this realization influence your understanding of your need for salvation?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Meditate on the truth that God used the unjust killing of Jesus to accomplish His redemptive plan. How does this display God's sovereignty and ability to bring good out of evil?&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the Gospels, it is mentioned that Jesus was crucified on the Day of Preparation (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/27/Matthew-27-62.html"&gt;Matthew 27:62&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/15/Mark-15-42.html"&gt;Mark 15:42&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/23/Luke-23-54.html"&gt;Luke 23:54&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/19/John-19-14.html"&gt;John 19:14&lt;/a&gt;, 31, 42). This raises the question of why Jesus had already observed the Passover with His disciples before the Day …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Day of Preparation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Gospels, it is mentioned that Jesus was crucified on the Day of Preparation (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/27/Matthew-27-62.html"&gt;Matthew 27:62&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/15/Mark-15-42.html"&gt;Mark 15:42&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/23/Luke-23-54.html"&gt;Luke 23:54&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/19/John-19-14.html"&gt;John 19:14&lt;/a&gt;, 31, 42). This raises the question of why Jesus had already observed the Passover with His disciples before the Day of Preparation. To understand this, we need to examine the context and significance of the Day of Preparation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What is the Day of Preparation?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every week, preparations had to be made for the Sabbath, which was observed from Friday evening to Saturday evening. These preparations included getting food ready ahead of time. As a result, "Day of Preparation" became a common term for "Friday." &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/15/Mark-15-42.html"&gt;Mark 15:42&lt;/a&gt; specifically states that Jesus was crucified on the Day of Preparation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Observing Passover and the Day of Preparation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus and His disciples observed the Passover meal together before the Day of Preparation. The Passover meal was traditionally eaten on Nissan 14, according to the Mosaic Law (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Numbers/9/Numbers-9-2.html"&gt;Numbers 9:2-3&lt;/a&gt;). We can assume that Jesus kept the Law and observed Passover at the appointed time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the Passover meal on Thursday, the following day was the Day of Preparation (Friday) when Jesus was crucified. This was followed by the Sabbath (Saturday) and then the first day of the week (Sunday), which is when Jesus rose from the dead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0N20v9E0c1E" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Understanding John's Statement&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In John's account, he mentions that Jesus died on "the day of Preparation of the Passover" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/19/John-19-14.html"&gt;John 19:14&lt;/a&gt;). It is possible that John simply meant that this particular Friday fell during Passover week. In other words, it was the Day of Preparation that happened to coincide with the season of Passover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Feast of Unleavened Bread&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Feast (or Festival) of Unleavened Bread lasted for a full week, from Nissan 15 to Nissan 22. The first day of Unleavened Bread coincided with the day of Passover. Because of the close relation between Passover and the Feast of Unleavened Bread, the whole week was sometimes referred to as "Passover." The two holidays were considered a single celebration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/18/John-18-28.html"&gt;John 18:28&lt;/a&gt;, it is mentioned that the Jewish leaders did not enter Pilate's palace on the morning after Jesus' arrest to avoid ceremonial uncleanness so that they could eat the Passover. This seems to create a discrepancy since Jesus and His disciples had already eaten the Passover meal the night before. However, it is important to note that the Jewish leaders had already eaten the Passover proper but were still participating in the remainder of the week's ceremonies, including other sacrifices and meals associated with the Feast of Unleavened Bread.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the chronology and significance of the Day of Preparation and the observance of Passover helps us grasp the events leading up to Jesus' crucifixion and resurrection. It highlights Jesus' fulfillment of the Mosaic Law and His role as the ultimate sacrificial Lamb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reflecting on the timeline of events leading up to Jesus' crucifixion and resurrection can deepen our appreciation for God's plan of redemption. It reminds us that Jesus willingly sacrificed Himself to atone for our sins and reconcile us with God. Consider how this sacrifice impacts your own life and relationship with God.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Jesus Christ/The Cross and the Empty Tomb/The Road to the Cross"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>The Ultimate Sacrifice: Unveiling the Passion of Christ</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/passion-of-christ/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-06-18T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-06-18T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-06-18:/passion-of-christ/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;The Passion of Christ&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The passion of Christ refers to the period from Jesus' prayer in the Garden of Gethsemane to His death on the cross. The word "passion" comes from the Latin word "pati," which means "to endure" or "to suffer." This time is associated with Jesus' greatest suffering and is recorded in the Bible in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/26/Matthew-26-36.html"&gt;Matthew 26:36&lt;/a&gt;–27:56, &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/14/Mark-14-32.html"&gt;Mark 14:32&lt;/a&gt;–15:41, &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/22/Luke-22-39.html"&gt;Luke 22:39&lt;/a&gt;–23:49, and &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/18/John-18-1.html"&gt;John 18:1&lt;/a&gt;–19:37.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What is the Passion of Christ?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The passion of Christ is a central theme in Christian theology. It represents the suffering that Jesus endured during His crucifixion, which is considered the apex of human history. The apostles' teaching focused on Jesus Christ and Him crucified (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-Corinthians/2/1-Corinthians-2-2.html"&gt;1 Corinthians 2:2&lt;/a&gt;). Through His passionate suffering, we are made right with God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to understand that Christ's suffering was not merely an appearance. He truly suffered and died for our sins. When Jesus prayed in Gethsemane, He expressed genuine anguish over what He was about to endure. As He was beaten, mocked, and crucified, He experienced real and excruciating suffering. All of this was done to save those who would put their trust in Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Meaning of the Passion of Christ&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The prophet Isaiah foretold the passion of Christ in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/53/Isaiah-53-4.html"&gt;Isaiah 53:4&lt;/a&gt;–12. This passage reveals the significance of His suffering. It states that Jesus took up our pain and bore our suffering. He was pierced for our transgressions and crushed for our iniquities. The punishment that brought us peace was upon Him, and by His wounds, we are healed. It emphasizes that Jesus bore the sin of many and made intercession for the transgressors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through His suffering, Jesus fulfilled God's plan to redeem humanity. He willingly laid down His life to pay the price for our sins. His death on the cross served as an offering for sin, and by His knowledge, many are justified. Jesus' passion demonstrates God's love and mercy towards us, offering forgiveness and salvation to all who believe in Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the passion of Christ is crucial for Christians because it reveals the depth of God's love and the cost of our redemption. Jesus' suffering and death were not arbitrary or accidental; they were part of God's eternal plan to reconcile humanity to Himself. Recognizing the reality and significance of Jesus' passion deepens our appreciation for His sacrifice and motivates us to live lives that honor Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/a0U7vwQB3so" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The passion of Christ also serves as an example for believers. Jesus endured unimaginable suffering with humility, obedience, and unwavering commitment to God's will. His passion teaches us about selflessness, sacrifice, and the importance of submitting to God's purposes even when facing hardships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider the profound love that Jesus displayed through His passion. Despite knowing the pain, humiliation, and death that awaited Him, He willingly endured it all for our sake. Reflecting on His sacrifice can lead to a deeper gratitude for His grace and inspire us to live lives characterized by love and selflessness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, meditating on the passion of Christ can help us find hope in our own sufferings. Jesus experienced immense pain and anguish but emerged victorious through His resurrection. This reminds us that even in our darkest moments, God is present, working all things together for our good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The passion of Christ refers to the period from Jesus' prayer in the Garden of Gethsemane to His death on the cross. It represents His greatest suffering and is recorded in the Bible as a central theme in Christian theology. Jesus' passion was not a result of temporary strong emotion but a settled purpose to lay down His life for humanity. Through His suffering, Jesus fulfilled God's plan for redemption and offered forgiveness and salvation to all who believe in Him. Understanding the passion of Christ deepens our appreciation for His sacrifice, inspires us to live selflessly, and gives us hope in the midst of our own sufferings.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Jesus Christ/The Cross and the Empty Tomb/The Road to the Cross"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Three Days of Redemption: A Christian Journey Towards Grace</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/three-days/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-06-13T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-06-13T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-06-13:/three-days/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Three Days&lt;/h2&gt;

However, there are …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Three Days&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The crucifixion and resurrection of Jesus Christ are central events in Christianity. According to the Bible, Jesus was crucified on the day of preparation, which is commonly believed to be a Friday, and rose again on the first day of the week, which is Sunday. However, there are different viewpoints regarding the exact timeline of these events. In this article, we will explore three perspectives: the Friday view, the Thursday view, and the Wednesday view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Friday View&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The traditional view holds that Jesus was crucified on a Friday. According to this timeline, Jesus was killed in AD 30 on Passover, which fell on a Friday, known as Nisan 14 in the Jewish calendar. The Passover meal was eaten on this day, and it was also the time to prepare for the Feast of Unleavened Bread, which began the following day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/15/Mark-15-42.html"&gt;Mark 15:42&lt;/a&gt; mentions that Jesus was crucified on "the day before the Sabbath." Supporters of the Friday view interpret this Sabbath as the weekly observance held on Saturday. After Jesus' crucifixion, the women followed His body to the tomb "late on Friday afternoon, the day of preparation, as the Sabbath was about to begin" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/23/Luke-23-54.html"&gt;Luke 23:54&lt;/a&gt;). On Saturday (Nisan 15), the chief priests and Pharisees met with Pilate to have the tomb sealed and guarded (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/27/Matthew-27-62.html"&gt;Matthew 27:62&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to this perspective, Jesus spent three days in the tomb by reckoning part of a day as a full day. He was buried late on Friday (Day 1), remained in the tomb throughout Saturday (Day 2), and rose from the dead early on Sunday (Day 3). This interpretation aligns with verses such as &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/16/Matthew-16-21.html"&gt;Matthew 16:21&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/9/Luke-9-22.html"&gt;Luke 9:22&lt;/a&gt;, which mention that Jesus would rise "on the third day." &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the timeline of Jesus' crucifixion and resurrection is important because it confirms the fulfillment of biblical prophecies and the significance of Jesus as the Passover lamb. By sacrificing Himself on Passover, Jesus became our ultimate Passover lamb, taking away our sins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Think About It&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider the significance of Jesus' sacrifice as the Passover lamb. How does this impact your understanding of His crucifixion and resurrection?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Thursday View&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An alternate view suggests that Jesus was crucified on a Thursday. According to this perspective, the day of preparation mentioned in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/15/Mark-15-42.html"&gt;Mark 15:42&lt;/a&gt; refers to the day before the Passover, which was a high Sabbath (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/19/John-19-14.html"&gt;John 19:14&lt;/a&gt;). This view takes into account that there were two Sabbaths that week: the Passover Sabbath starting at sundown on Thursday and followed by the regular Sabbath starting at sundown on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Supporters of the Thursday view argue that Jesus' prophecy of three days and three nights in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/12/Matthew-12-40.html"&gt;Matthew 12:40&lt;/a&gt; includes both nights and days. If the crucifixion occurred on Thursday afternoon, all three days and nights are accounted for. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/23/Luke-23-56.html"&gt;Luke 23:56&lt;/a&gt; states that after seeing where Jesus was buried, the women went home to prepare spices and perfumes but rested on the Sabbath in obedience to the commandment. The Thursday view suggests that they could only purchase and prepare the spices after the Sabbath (the Passover Sabbath) and before the weekly Sabbath.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xU54nPjy8qY" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Advocates for a Thursday crucifixion also point to passages like &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/2/John-2-19.html"&gt;John 2:19&lt;/a&gt;, where Jesus mentions raising the temple in three days, and &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/24/Luke-24-21.html"&gt;Luke 24:21&lt;/a&gt;, where disciples on the road to Emmaus state that it is the third day since all these things happened. These passages indicate a crucifixion on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding different perspectives on the timeline of Jesus' crucifixion helps us engage with biblical texts and consider various interpretations. While the day of the week may be debated, the central truth remains: Jesus died and rose again for our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Think About It&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider how the Thursday view challenges your understanding of the timeline. How does this impact your perception of Jesus' sacrifice?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Wednesday View&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Wednesday view proposes that Jesus was crucified on a Wednesday. This perspective also acknowledges that there were two Sabbaths that week: the Passover Sabbath starting Wednesday evening and the regular weekly Sabbath starting Friday evening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proponents of the Wednesday view argue that the women purchased spices after the Sabbath (the Passover Sabbath) and prepared them before the Sabbath. This suggests that there were two Sabbaths separated by a non-Sabbath day (Friday).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Supporters of this view believe that counting three days and three nights from Wednesday to Sunday fulfills Jesus' prophecy in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/12/Matthew-12-40.html"&gt;Matthew 12:40&lt;/a&gt;. The timeline is as follows: early Thursday (Day 1), late Thursday (Night 1), early Friday (Day 2), late Friday (Night 2), early Saturday (Day 3), and late Saturday (Night 3).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is worth noting that &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/24/Luke-24-13.html"&gt;Luke 24:13&lt;/a&gt; mentions that the disciples on the road to Emmaus encountered Jesus on "the same day" of His resurrection, implying a three-day count from Wednesday evening to Sunday morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exploring different views on the crucifixion timeline encourages us to engage with Scripture more deeply and consider alternative interpretations. Ultimately, our faith rests in the fact that Jesus died, was buried, and rose again to save us from our sins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Think About It&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reflect on how the Wednesday view challenges traditional understandings of Jesus' crucifixion. How does this affect your perception of His sacrifice?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, there are varying perspectives on the precise timeline of Jesus' crucifixion and resurrection. While each viewpoint presents its own arguments and interpretations of biblical passages, it is crucial to remember that the central truth remains unchanged: Jesus willingly gave His life as a sacrifice for our sins and rose again, offering us salvation and eternal life. Regardless of the specific day of the week, let us focus on the significance of Jesus' sacrifice and the hope we have through His resurrection.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Jesus Christ/The Cross and the Empty Tomb/The Road to the Cross"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Jesus' Final Hours: The Ultimate Story of Sacrifice and Redemption</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/jesus-last-hours/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-05-21T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-05-21T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-05-21:/jesus-last-hours/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Jesus' Last Hours&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Jesus' Final Meal and …&lt;/h3&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Jesus' Last Hours&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus' last hours before His crucifixion were filled with significant events and profound emotions. These final moments reveal the immense sacrifice and love that Jesus demonstrated for humanity. Let's explore the key events leading up to His crucifixion and the significance they hold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Jesus' Final Meal and Betrayal&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The night before His death, Jesus shared a Passover meal with His disciples. During this meal, Jesus washed the feet of His disciples, teaching them about humility and servanthood. It was during this time that He also revealed that one of His disciples, Judas Iscariot, would betray Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the meal, Jesus instituted the Lord's Supper, a powerful act of remembrance that Christians continue to observe today. This symbolic act involves partaking of bread and wine, representing Jesus' body and blood given for the salvation of humanity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Agony in the Garden&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the meal, Jesus took His disciples to the Garden of Gethsemane. He asked Peter, James, and John to stay awake and pray while He withdrew to pray alone. Overwhelmed with sorrow and anguish, Jesus experienced such intense distress that His sweat fell like drops of blood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In His prayer, Jesus asked God to take away the forthcoming torment if it aligned with the Father's will. However, what troubled Him most was not the physical pain but the weight of sin He would bear on behalf of humanity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An angel appeared to strengthen Jesus during this agonizing time. Despite asking His closest disciples to pray for Him, they fell asleep repeatedly. This highlights the human struggle Jesus faced alone as He prepared to fulfill God's plan for salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ef47Xkd3Meo" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Trials and Mockery&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After being betrayed by Judas, Jesus endured a series of trials conducted by both Jewish and Roman authorities. These trials were characterized by mockings, beatings, and false accusations. The Jewish leaders, including Annas and Caiaphas, sought to find evidence against Jesus to justify His crucifixion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus also appeared before Pontius Pilate, the Roman governor of Judea, and Herod Antipas, the ruler of Galilee. Despite Pilate's recognition of Jesus' innocence, he gave in to the pressure from the crowd who demanded Jesus' crucifixion. Ultimately, Pilate handed Jesus over to be crucified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Crucifixion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The crucifixion was a brutal form of execution reserved for criminals during Roman times. Jesus was nailed to a wooden cross and left to die a slow and agonizing death. In this excruciating position, He had to choose between resting His weight on the spikes driven into His hands or pushing up on the spikes in His feet to breathe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Jesus hung on the cross, people who had previously celebrated Him now taunted Him. Roman soldiers divided His possessions before His death. Amidst this anguish, Jesus witnessed His mother's grief as she looked upon the One promised to save the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the soldiers came to break Jesus' legs, a common method to hasten death for those crucified, they discovered that He was already dead. Having fully surrendered His spirit, Jesus had completed His redemptive mission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding Jesus' last hours is essential for Christians because it reveals the depth of His sacrifice and love for humanity. By grasping the magnitude of Jesus' suffering and the weight of sin He bore, believers can appreciate the price paid for their salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus' willingness to endure such immense physical and emotional pain demonstrates His unwavering commitment to fulfilling God's plan for redemption. It serves as a reminder that God's love knows no bounds and that Jesus willingly laid down His life for humanity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reflecting on Jesus' last hours allows us to consider our response to His sacrifice. How does knowing the extent of Jesus' suffering impact our relationship with Him? How can we honor His sacrifice in our daily lives? Taking time to contemplate these questions can deepen our faith and inspire us to live more fully for Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, Jesus' last hours were marked by acts of love, betrayal, anguish, mockery, and ultimately, His crucifixion. It is through understanding and reflecting upon these events that Christians can appreciate the profound sacrifice Jesus made for the salvation of humanity. May we never forget the depth of His love and the significance of His final hours.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Jesus Christ/The Cross and the Empty Tomb/The Road to the Cross"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Crucify Him: Understanding the Ultimate Sacrifice in Christian Faith</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/crucify-him/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-05-19T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-05-19T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-05-19:/crucify-him/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Crucify Him&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Jesus was brought before the Roman governor, Pontius Pilate, Pilate could not find any fault in Him. He said so three times during the trial. Pilate sought a way to release Jesus, but instead, he offered the crowd a choice between Jesus and a convicted criminal named Barabbas, hoping they would choose Jesus. However, to Pilate's surprise, the crowd chose Barabbas for release. When Pilate asked what should be done with Jesus, the crowd cried out, "Crucify Him!"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The religious and political leaders of that time hated and opposed Jesus because His teachings had alienated and angered them. He had exposed their hypocrisy on numerous occasions and claimed to be God, which was considered blasphemy by the unbelieving teachers of the law. The religious leaders wanted to utterly destroy Jesus, and only His death would satisfy them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crucifixion was reserved for the worst of criminals during that time. It was a torturous method of execution that would last for hours. The religious leaders who despised Jesus likely saw crucifixion as a fitting punishment for Him. They arrested and tried Jesus in secret to hide their move against Him from His many supporters. When Jesus was brought before Pilate, it was still early in the morning. The chief priests whipped the crowd into a frenzy, encouraging them to call for Barabbas's release. Influenced by the chief priests, the crowd shouted, "Crucify Him!" Pilate, eager to please the people, gave in to their demands and had Jesus flogged and then turned over for crucifixion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The events leading up to Jesus' crucifixion were puzzling. Just days earlier, there was a crowd in Jerusalem celebrating Jesus as the Messiah during His triumphal entry into the city. However, on Friday, there was a different crowd crying out for His crucifixion. The change of heart in the city is difficult to understand. Some people may have been part of both crowds, having become disillusioned with Jesus when they realized He was not going to establish His kingdom immediately or because they disliked His call for repentance. It is also possible that the crowd gathered before Pilate had been assembled and influenced by the Jewish leaders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, it was not the crowd's cries of "Crucify Him!" that put Jesus on the cross. It was our sin. From the beginning, God had promised to send a Savior who would conquer sin and death. Jesus Christ, God's own Son, became the perfect God-man to take upon Himself the punishment for our sins. Although wicked men played a role in Jesus' death, His sacrifice was ultimately the will of God. The shedding of Jesus' blood fulfilled God's promise to provide a Savior and established the New Covenant. Jesus conquered death by rising again three days later and ascending to His Father's right hand in heaven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the events leading up to Jesus' crucifixion is crucial for Christians because it reveals the depth of God's love and His plan for salvation. Despite being innocent, Jesus willingly endured the cross for our sake. His sacrifice provides forgiveness and redemption for all who believe in Him. By recognizing our sinfulness and accepting Jesus as our Savior, we can experience the freedom and eternal life that He offers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reflect on the religious and political leaders' hatred for Jesus during His time on earth. How does this highlight the opposition that often arises when one stands for truth and righteousness?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consider the crowd's change of heart from celebrating Jesus as the Messiah to demanding His crucifixion. How does this remind us of the fickle nature of human emotions and the importance of placing our faith in Christ alone?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contemplate the significance of Jesus' sacrifice on the cross. How does His death demonstrate God's love for humanity and provide a way for us to be reconciled with Him?&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The responsibility for Jesus' death can be attributed to several parties, as outlined in the Bible. The religious leaders of Israel played a significant role in plotting and orchestrating Jesus' arrest and execution. In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/26/Matthew-26-3.html"&gt;Matthew 26:3&lt;/a&gt;–4, it is mentioned that the chief priests and …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Responsible for Christ's Death&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The responsibility for Jesus' death can be attributed to several parties, as outlined in the Bible. The religious leaders of Israel played a significant role in plotting and orchestrating Jesus' arrest and execution. In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/26/Matthew-26-3.html"&gt;Matthew 26:3&lt;/a&gt;–4, it is mentioned that the chief priests and elders of the people gathered in the palace of the high priest, Caiaphas, and conspired to secretly arrest Jesus and have Him killed. They were threatened by His signs and wonders, which posed a challenge to their authority in the religious society they dominated (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/11/John-11-47.html"&gt;John 11:47&lt;/a&gt;–50). Therefore, they plotted to take His life (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/11/John-11-53.html"&gt;John 11:53&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although it was the Romans who physically crucified Jesus, it was at the insistence of the Jewish leaders. The Jewish leaders demanded that Jesus be put to death when He stood trial before Pilate (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/27/Matthew-27-22.html"&gt;Matthew 27:22&lt;/a&gt;–25). The Romans, under the authority of Pontius Pilate, carried out the crucifixion. Roman soldiers drove nails into Jesus' hands and feet, erected the cross, and a Roman soldier pierced His side (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/27/Matthew-27-27.html"&gt;Matthew 27:27&lt;/a&gt;–35).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/U_rzCrR4JJo" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the people of Israel also played a role in Jesus' death. They shouted "Crucify him! Crucify him!" when Jesus stood trial before Pilate (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/23/Luke-23-21.html"&gt;Luke 23:21&lt;/a&gt;). They even chose to have Barabbas, a thief, released instead of Jesus (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/27/Matthew-27-21.html"&gt;Matthew 27:21&lt;/a&gt;). Peter confirmed this complicity of Israel in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Acts/2/Acts-2-22.html"&gt;Acts 2:22&lt;/a&gt;–23 when he addressed the men of Israel, stating that they put Jesus to death by nailing Him to the cross with the help of wicked men. Therefore, it can be seen that Jesus' murder was a conspiracy involving various parties such as Rome, Herod, the Jewish leaders, and the people of Israel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to note that while God did not literally kill Jesus, He allowed Him to be put to death by the hands of the Jews and Romans. &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Acts/2/Acts-2-23.html"&gt;Acts 2:23&lt;/a&gt; emphasizes God's sovereign knowledge in allowing people to unlawfully murder His Son as part of His deliberate plan and foreknowledge. However, God did not allow death to have the final say. He raised Jesus from the dead, freeing Him from the agony of death because it was impossible for death to hold Him (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Acts/2/Acts-2-24.html"&gt;Acts 2:24&lt;/a&gt;). This highlights that Christ's death and resurrection were part of God's perfect plan to redeem all who believe in Him. As &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/2-Corinthians/5/2-Corinthians-5-21.html"&gt;2 Corinthians 5:21&lt;/a&gt; states, "God made him who had no sin to be sin for us so that in him we might become the righteousness of God." Jesus' sacrificial death on the cross provides salvation for all who put their faith in Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the responsibility for Jesus' death is crucial in grasping the significance of His sacrifice and the redemption He offers to humanity. Recognizing that it was a collective effort involving religious leaders, the Roman authorities, and even the people of Israel helps us comprehend the magnitude of Jesus' love for us. Despite being innocent, He willingly submitted Himself to unjust treatment and death because of His deep desire to save humanity from sin and reconcile us with God. It is through His death and resurrection that we can receive forgiveness and eternal life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider how Jesus' sacrificial death demonstrates the extent of God's love for you personally. Reflect on the responsibility each party had in Jesus' crucifixion and consider how this impacts your understanding of human sinfulness and our need for a Savior. How does knowing that God allowed Jesus' death as part of His divine plan affect your perception of His sovereignty and purpose in your life? Take time to thank Jesus for His sacrifice and reflect on how His death has brought about salvation and reconciliation for all who believe in Him.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Jesus Christ/The Cross and the Empty Tomb/The Road to the Cross"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry></feed>

&lt;h3&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The crucifixion of Jesus Christ is a central event in Christian theology and history. It has both earthly and heavenly reasons behind it, shedding light on the nature of mankind and God's plan for salvation. In this article, we will explore the reasons why Jesus was crucified, discussing the earthly motivations as well as the divine purpose behind this pivotal event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Earthly Reason: Mankind's Evil&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At an earthly level, Jesus was crucified because of the evil present in mankind. Wicked individuals conspired against Him, falsely accused Him, and ultimately orchestrated His murder. The leaders of Israel had various reasons for wanting Jesus executed. They were envious of His following and fearful that His popularity would attract unwanted attention from the Roman authorities, potentially jeopardizing their own positions. Additionally, they resented Jesus for publicly exposing their sins and for claiming to be the Son of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, these reasons were merely symptoms of their underlying unbelief. They failed to recognize Jesus as the long-awaited Messiah despite the evidence presented before them. Their hearts were hardened by pride and a refusal to accept Jesus' teachings and authority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus was crucified rather than being stoned, hanged, or subjected to other forms of execution because His death was carried out by the Romans. Crucifixion was a common method employed by the Roman Empire to serve as a deterrent against committing similar offenses. Pilate, the Roman governor, posted the charge "King of the Jews" on Jesus' cross to appease the Jewish leaders who sought His execution. Pilate could not afford to be seen as tolerating a potential rival to Caesar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Heavenly Reason: God's Plan for Salvation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond the earthly motivations, there is a deeper heavenly reason why Jesus was crucified — God's plan for salvation. From a divine perspective, God had a redemptive plan to save humanity from sin, and Jesus was the chosen Lamb of God who came to take away the sins of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the evil acts committed against Jesus, the crucifixion was part of God's overarching plan to provide atonement for sin. The book of Acts acknowledges that Herod, Pontius Pilate, the Gentiles, and the people of Israel conspired against Jesus, but it also highlights that they were fulfilling what God had decided beforehand. Although evil desires were at work, God allowed them to accomplish the greatest good — the provision of salvation for mankind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus Himself acknowledged that Pilate's power over Him was given from above, indicating divine permission in the face of darkness. God used the hatred, conspiracy, false accusations, sham trials, and murder of His Son to achieve a glorious outcome. &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/53/Isaiah-53-10.html"&gt;Isaiah 53:10&lt;/a&gt; says, "It was the LORD's will to crush Him and cause Him to suffer," emphasizing that God had a purpose in Jesus' crucifixion. This purpose ultimately led to Jesus bearing the sins of many and making intercession for transgressors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/U_rzCrR4JJo" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Fulfillment of Prophecy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there is no explicit mandate in Old Testament prophecy for the Messiah to be crucified, there are hints and foreshadowing of this manner of death. &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Galatians/3/Galatians-3-13.html"&gt;Galatians 3:13&lt;/a&gt; connects Jesus' death on the cross with &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Deuteronomy/21/Deuteronomy-21-22.html"&gt;Deuteronomy 21:22&lt;/a&gt;–23. Crucifixion allowed for the piercing mentioned in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Zechariah/12/Zechariah-12-10.html"&gt;Zechariah 12:10&lt;/a&gt;, and it resulted in the shedding of blood necessary for a sacrificial offering as stated in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/9/Hebrews-9-22.html"&gt;Hebrews 9:22&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The crucifixion also fulfilled aspects of Psalm 22, which describes the anguish experienced by David but finds fulfillment in Jesus' suffering on the cross. Moreover, Jesus' bones were not broken during His crucifixion, aligning with &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Exodus/12/Exodus-12-46.html"&gt;Exodus 12:46&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/19/John-19-36.html"&gt;John 19:36&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding why Jesus was crucified is crucial for believers as it deepens their appreciation of God's plan for salvation. It highlights the extent of mankind's sinfulness and the lengths to which God went to redeem humanity. Recognizing the earthly and heavenly reasons behind Jesus' crucifixion allows us to grasp both the evil inherent in humanity and the goodness and sovereignty of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The crucifixion serves as a powerful reminder of the depth of God's love for us. It demonstrates His willingness to sacrifice His Son in order to reconcile sinful humanity to Himself. This knowledge should inspire gratitude, humility, and a desire to live in obedience to God's will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reflect on the earthly motivations that led to Jesus' crucifixion. Consider how envy, fear, pride, and unbelief can still hinder our recognition of Jesus today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contemplate the divine purpose behind Jesus' crucifixion. Ponder the depths of God's love and mercy in providing salvation for humanity through the sacrificial death of His Son.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How does understanding the reasons behind Jesus' crucifixion impact your relationship with God? How might it shape your perspective on sin, forgiveness, and the importance of faith in Jesus?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, Jesus was crucified due to the evil present in mankind, driven by envy, fear, pride, and unbelief. However, from a heavenly perspective, God allowed Jesus' crucifixion as part of His plan for salvation. It fulfilled prophecies and demonstrated His love for humanity. Recognizing these reasons encourages believers to reflect on their own hearts and respond with gratitude and faith in Jesus' sacrificial death.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Jesus Christ/The Cross and the Empty Tomb/On the Cross"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>INRI Meaning and Significance: The Crucifixion Code Unveiled</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/inri/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-09-22T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-09-22T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-09-22:/inri/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;INRI&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Jesus was crucified, a notice was prepared and placed on the cross. According to &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/19/John-19-19.html"&gt;John 19:19&lt;/a&gt;, the notice read, "JESUS OF NAZARETH, THE KING OF THE JEWS." This notice was written in three languages: Aramaic, Latin, and Greek, as mentioned in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/19/John-19-20.html"&gt;John 19:20&lt;/a&gt;. Today, it is …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;INRI&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Jesus was crucified, a notice was prepared and placed on the cross. According to &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/19/John-19-19.html"&gt;John 19:19&lt;/a&gt;, the notice read, "JESUS OF NAZARETH, THE KING OF THE JEWS." This notice was written in three languages: Aramaic, Latin, and Greek, as mentioned in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/19/John-19-20.html"&gt;John 19:20&lt;/a&gt;. Today, it is common to see the letters INRI placed on the sign above the cross. INRI is an abbreviation of the Latin phrase "Iesus Nazarenus Rex Iudaeorum," which translates to "Jesus of Nazareth, the King of the Jews."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, it is important to note that the exact letters INRI were unlikely to be on the sign that Pilate placed over Jesus' head. &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/19/John-19-20.html"&gt;John 19:20&lt;/a&gt; specifies that the sign was written in Aramaic, Greek, and Latin. The display of INRI is a symbolic representation of the inscription that would have been present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is interesting to observe the difference in terminology used to describe the writing on the sign. While John's gospel refers to it as a "title," Mark and Matthew refer to it as an "accusation." It was customary during that time to display above the heads of those being crucified the crime for which they were suffering and their name. In Jesus' case, the accusation was his claim to be the King of the Jews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ironically, this "crime" for which Jesus was crucified is not a crime at all but an absolute truth. Jesus is not only the King of the Jews but also the King of all. He is the King of kings and Lord of lords (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Revelation/17/Revelation-17-14.html"&gt;Revelation 17:14&lt;/a&gt;; 19:16). His kingship extends over the entire universe and all its inhabitants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The inscription on the cross represents not only Jesus' claim as King but also serves as a reminder of why He was crucified. Jesus' crucifixion was not due to any wrongdoing on His part, but rather, it was for the sins of all who would put their faith in Him for salvation. As &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Colossians/2/Colossians-2-14.html"&gt;Colossians 2:14&lt;/a&gt; states, Jesus "blotted out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to us, and has taken it out of the way, nailing it to the cross."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cnVFbQOwdZE" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just as the title "King of the Jews" was written in multiple languages, people from all nations and languages recognize Jesus as their Savior. He is the perfect and complete Savior who bore our sins in His own body on the cross. He is the only everlasting Savior for all those whom God has chosen to save.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the significance of the inscription on Jesus' cross can deepen our appreciation for His sacrifice. It reminds us that Jesus willingly gave His life for our sake, taking upon Himself the punishment for our sins. The inscription also highlights Jesus' kingship and lordship over all creation. Recognizing Jesus as King and Savior allows us to surrender our lives to Him and experience His transforming power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reflect on what it means for Jesus to be both King of the Jews and King of all. How does this impact your understanding of His authority and sovereignty?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider how Jesus' crucifixion serves as a demonstration of His love and willingness to bear the sins of humanity. How does this inspire you to respond to His sacrifice?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contemplate the significance of Jesus being the only and everlasting Savior. How does this truth shape your perspective on salvation and your relationship with Him?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ponder on the inscription on Jesus' cross being written in multiple languages. How does this symbolize Jesus' universal relevance and His invitation to all people, regardless of their background or language?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of Jesus' life, while hanging on the cross, a significant event occurred. The sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was torn in two. In this moment, Jesus called out with a loud voice, saying, "Father, into your hands I commit my spirit." These words hold deep meaning and significance. It is important to note that when Jesus spoke these words, He was quoting Scripture. Specifically, He was quoting &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/31/Psalm-31-5.html"&gt;Psalm 31:5&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier on the cross, Jesus also quoted from &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/22/Psalm-22-1.html"&gt;Psalm 22:1&lt;/a&gt;. In everything Jesus did and said, He fulfilled the will of God and the word of God. Even in His final moments, Jesus was aware of His mission and pointed those around Him to the fulfillment of prophecy. Psalm 31 is a prayer of David in distress, expressing trust in God. In Luke 23, Jesus echoes this prayer as the Son of David.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The words Jesus utters from the cross are not merely didactic; they also reflect His true emotions. Just as David cried out to God in his time of need, Jesus feels an acute and pressing need for help. He turns to the "faithful God," recognizing that only God can provide true aid. Despite all the trouble surrounding Him, Jesus' spirit reaches upward for relief with unwavering confidence in God as His refuge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus prays, "Father, into your hands I commit my spirit," because it is only in the Father's hands that our spirits are truly safe. Jesus had previously taught about the security of believers when He said, "My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all; no one can snatch them out of my Father's hand" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/10/John-10-29.html"&gt;John 10:29&lt;/a&gt;). Just as we secure our most valuable earthly possessions in a safe or bank vault where we know they will be protected from harm, Jesus shows us that we should commit our spirits into the Father's hands, the safest place of all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we are saved, we commit our spirits into the Father's hands, trusting Him for our salvation. From then on, our lives are lived in a continuous commitment of our spirits into His hands. We entrust Him with our service to Him, our daily decisions, and all our joys and sorrows. And when the time of our death comes, we can follow Jesus' example and say, "Father, into your hands I commit my spirit."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout history, many Christians have found comfort in Psalm 31 and have echoed Jesus' words from the cross at the time of their death. Stephen, the first Christian martyr, prayed a modified version of Jesus' prayer as he was being stoned to death (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Acts/7/Acts-7-59.html"&gt;Acts 7:59&lt;/a&gt;). Other notable Christians who have said, "Into your hands I commit my spirit," as they left this world include Polycarp, Martin Luther, and Philip Melanchthon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The phrase "Into your hands I commit my spirit" carries deep significance for Christians. It reminds us of Jesus' ultimate trust in God the Father and serves as a model for us to follow. By committing our spirits into the Father's hands, we acknowledge His sovereignty and place our trust in His faithful care. It is a declaration that we believe in God's power to protect us and guide us through all circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/84I3aIQZ0Ew" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The words Jesus spoke on the cross also remind us of the fulfillment of prophecy. He fulfilled not only the prophecies about the Messiah but also the prayers of David recorded in the Psalms. This demonstrates the unity and continuity of Scripture and reinforces our confidence in its divine inspiration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you ever thought about what it means to commit your spirit into God's hands? Take a moment to reflect on what this act of trust and surrender entails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In what areas of your life do you find it challenging to fully commit your spirit into God's hands? Ask God for His help and guidance in entrusting those areas to Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can you incorporate the example of Jesus' prayer into your daily life? Consider how committing your spirit into God's hands can impact your decision-making, relationships, and overall outlook on life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

They also mocked Him …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Crown of Thorns&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The crown of thorns is a significant symbol in the Christian faith, representing both the mockery and suffering Jesus endured before His crucifixion. After Jesus' sham trials and flogging, Roman soldiers twisted together a crown of thorns and placed it on His head. They also mocked Him, proclaiming, "Hail, king of the Jews!" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/27/Matthew-27-29.html"&gt;Matthew 27:29&lt;/a&gt;). While painful, the crown of thorns was primarily a symbol of mockery rather than solely inflicting physical torment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MeeTVK5XFpY" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Jesus as the King&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Christians, the crown of thorns serves as a reminder of two important aspects. First, it signifies that Jesus is indeed a king. In the future, the entire universe will acknowledge Jesus as the "King of kings and Lord of lords" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Revelation/19/Revelation-19-16.html"&gt;Revelation 19:16&lt;/a&gt;). The soldiers' intention to mock Jesus actually revealed His dual roles as both a suffering servant (Isaiah 53) and a conquering Messiah-King (Revelation 19).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Jesus' Sacrifice for Humanity&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, the crown of thorns represents Jesus' willingness to endure pain, insults, and shame on behalf of humanity. He suffered so that we could be saved. Though the crown of thorns and its associated suffering are long gone, Jesus has received the crown that He truly deserves. &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/2/Hebrews-2-9.html"&gt;Hebrews 2:9&lt;/a&gt; states, "But we see him who for a little while was made lower than the angels, namely Jesus because of the suffering of death, so that by the grace of God he might taste death for everyone."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Symbolism Within&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The crown of thorns also holds deeper symbolism. When Adam and Eve sinned in the Garden of Eden, they brought evil and a curse upon the world. As part of this curse, God declared that the ground would produce thorns and thistles (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/3/Genesis-3-17.html"&gt;Genesis 3:17-18&lt;/a&gt;). Unbeknownst to them, the Roman soldiers unintentionally took an object of this curse and fashioned it into a crown for the Savior who would deliver humanity from the consequences of sin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Christ's Redemption&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The curse that humanity inherited due to sin is powerfully addressed in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Galatians/3/Galatians-3-13.html"&gt;Galatians 3:13&lt;/a&gt;: "Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us—for it is written, 'Cursed is everyone who is hanged on a tree.'" Through His perfect atoning sacrifice, Jesus has freed us from the curse of sin, symbolized by the thorns. While intended as a mockery, the crown of thorns becomes a profound symbol of who Jesus is and what He came to accomplish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the significance of the crown of thorns deepens our appreciation for Jesus' sacrifice and His role as both suffering servant and victorious King. It reminds us that Jesus willingly endured unimaginable pain and humiliation out of love for humanity. This act of redemption offers hope and salvation to all who believe in Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider the powerful symbolism behind the crown of thorns. Reflect on how Jesus transformed an object of the curse into a symbol of redemption. How does this impact your understanding of Jesus' sacrifice and His role in your life?&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Jesus Christ/The Cross and the Empty Tomb/On the Cross"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Jesus' Superiority Over Levitical Sacrifices: The Ultimate Comparison</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/jesus-better-levitical-sacrifices/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-08-26T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-08-26T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-08-26:/jesus-better-levitical-sacrifices/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Jesus' Superiority to Levitical Sacrifices&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book of Hebrews in the Bible presents a compelling case for why Jesus' sacrifice is superior to the Levitical sacrifices prescribed by the Old Covenant and the Law of Moses. Let's explore some key points from Hebrews that illustrate the superiority of Jesus' sacrifice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Jesus Chosen by God as Priest&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Old Testament, priests came from the Levitical line, simply by virtue of their lineage. However, Jesus was chosen by God as a priest based on His personal qualifications (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/7/Hebrews-7-11.html"&gt;Hebrews 7:11&lt;/a&gt;–22). This sets Jesus apart from the Levitical priests who became priests by birthright.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; By being chosen by God, Jesus demonstrates His unique qualification to serve as our eternal high priest. This shows that God's plan for salvation surpasses any human limitations or traditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; Consider how being chosen by God emphasizes Jesus' divine appointment and authority. Reflect on the significance of having a priest who is not bound by earthly heritage but rather chosen according to God's perfect will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Jesus' Eternal Priesthood&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike the Levitical priests who served temporarily and were continually replaced due to death, Jesus lives forever and serves as a priest eternally (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/7/Hebrews-7-23.html"&gt;Hebrews 7:23&lt;/a&gt;–25). This key difference highlights the permanence and continuity of Jesus' priesthood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Knowing that Jesus is an eternal high priest assures us that His intercession for us will never cease. We can have confidence in His constant advocacy before God on our behalf.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; Consider the assurance and comfort that comes from having a high priest who will never die or be replaced. Reflect on how this eternal aspect of Jesus' priesthood impacts your understanding of His role in your life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Jesus, Sinless High Priest&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_GOvVSZJxCU" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the Levitical priests had to offer sacrifices for their own sins before interceding for the people, Jesus had no sin and did not need to offer a sacrifice for Himself (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/7/Hebrews-7-26.html"&gt;Hebrews 7:26&lt;/a&gt;–27). Jesus' sinlessness sets Him apart as the perfect high priest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Jesus' sinlessness qualifies Him to be the perfect mediator between God and humanity. His purity ensures that His sacrifice is unblemished and fully sufficient to atone for our sins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; Reflect on the significance of having a high priest who is completely without sin. Consider how Jesus' sinlessness affects your understanding of His ability to represent you before God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Heavenly Ministry of Jesus&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Levitical priests ministered in an earthly setting, offering sacrifices in a physical temple. In contrast, Jesus ministers in the heavenly sanctuary (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/8/Hebrews-8-1.html"&gt;Hebrews 8:1&lt;/a&gt;–5). This distinction highlights the superiority of Jesus' ministry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Jesus' ministry in the heavenly sanctuary indicates a higher realm of operation. He is not limited by the confines of earthly rituals but instead operates in the very presence of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; Consider the significance of Jesus' heavenly ministry. Reflect on how this elevates His work and ministry beyond the earthly limitations of the Levitical priests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;New Covenant Ministry&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Levitical priests served under the Old Covenant, while Jesus ministers under the New Covenant established by God. The fact that God replaced the Old with the New demonstrates its superiority and implies deficiencies in the Old Covenant (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/8/Hebrews-8-6.html"&gt;Hebrews 8:6&lt;/a&gt;–13).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; The establishment of the New Covenant through Jesus signifies a new and better way of relating to God. It reveals God's desire to bring about a more perfect relationship with humanity through Jesus' sacrificial work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; Reflect on how the New Covenant in Christ has impacted your own relationship with God. Consider how this new way of relating to God brings about a greater sense of hope and fulfillment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Perfect Sacrifice Once and for All&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Levitical priests had to offer sacrifices repeatedly because their sacrifices were imperfect and could not truly take away sin. In contrast, Jesus offered Himself as a perfect sacrifice once and for all (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/9/Hebrews-9-11.html"&gt;Hebrews 9:11&lt;/a&gt;–24).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Jesus' perfect sacrifice provides complete and lasting forgiveness of sins. It surpasses the temporary and inadequate nature of the Levitical sacrifices, offering true reconciliation with God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; Reflect on the significance of Jesus' one-time sacrifice. Consider how this singular act of love and sacrifice impacted your life and brought about your redemption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary, the sacrifice of Jesus is superior to the Levitical sacrifices because it accomplished what the Levitical system could never achieve—complete forgiveness of sins through a sacrifice that is never to be repeated. Jesus' unique qualifications, eternal priesthood, sinlessness, heavenly ministry, establishment of the New Covenant, and perfect sacrifice distinguish Him as the ultimate high priest and Savior. Through faith in Jesus, we can experience the fullness of God's grace and have direct access to Him.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Jesus Christ/The Cross and the Empty Tomb/On the Cross"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>7 Powerful Sayings of Christ: Inspiring Words for Christian Faith</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/seven-sayings-christ/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-08-25T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-08-25T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-08-25:/seven-sayings-christ/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Seven Sayings of Christ on the Cross&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The crucifixion of Jesus Christ is a pivotal event in Christian theology. During His time on the cross, Jesus made seven significant statements that carry profound meaning for believers. Let's explore these sayings and their significance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1. "My God, my God, why have …&lt;/h3&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Seven Sayings of Christ on the Cross&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The crucifixion of Jesus Christ is a pivotal event in Christian theology. During His time on the cross, Jesus made seven significant statements that carry profound meaning for believers. Let's explore these sayings and their significance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1. "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/27/Matthew-27-46.html"&gt;Matthew 27:46&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this statement, Jesus expresses His feelings of abandonment as He takes upon Himself the sins of the world. Jesus, who is holy, was made to be sin for us so that we might be reconciled to God. This cry from the cross echoes the words of &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/22/Psalm-22-1.html"&gt;Psalm 22:1&lt;/a&gt; and shows the depth of Jesus' sacrifice for humanity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Jesus' cry reveals the extent to which He suffered on our behalf. It reminds us of the gravity of sin and the incredible love and sacrifice of Jesus in taking our place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; Reflect on the weight of your own sins and how Jesus willingly bore them for you. How does this make you feel? How does it impact your understanding of God's love?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2. "Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/23/Luke-23-34.html"&gt;Luke 23:34&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the mocking and cruelty He endured, Jesus extends forgiveness to those who crucified Him. Even in His moment of agony, Jesus demonstrates limitless compassion and divine grace. The ignorance of those who crucified Him does not excuse their actions, but Jesus' prayer reveals His heart of forgiveness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; This statement challenges us to extend forgiveness to others, even when they may not deserve it. It reminds us that forgiveness is a central aspect of Christian love and reflects God's character.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; Are there people in your life whom you find it difficult to forgive? How can you follow Jesus' example and extend forgiveness to them?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;3. "Truly, I say to you, today you will be with me in paradise" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/23/Luke-23-43.html"&gt;Luke 23:43&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the criminals crucified alongside Jesus recognized Him as the Messiah and asked for His mercy. In response, Jesus assured the criminal that they would be together in paradise that very day. This statement illustrates the power of faith and shows that even at the hour of death, it is never too late to turn to Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; This statement highlights the importance of faith in receiving eternal life. It emphasizes that salvation is available to all who turn to Jesus, regardless of their past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; How does this statement challenge your understanding of salvation? How does it give you hope for your own salvation and the salvation of others?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;4. "Father, into your hands I commit my spirit" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/23/Luke-23-46.html"&gt;Luke 23:46&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Jesus nears death, He willingly surrenders His soul into His Father's hands. This statement reveals His trust in God and signifies that His sacrifice has been accepted. Jesus' offering of Himself unblemished to God is a fulfillment of &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/9/Hebrews-9-14.html"&gt;Hebrews 9:14&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Jesus' words demonstrate His complete surrender to God and His trust in His Father's plan. It teaches us to trust God even in our darkest moments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; How can you cultivate a deeper trust in God? In what areas of your life do you struggle to surrender control to Him?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CetFnj31_zo" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;5. "Dear Woman, here is your son!" and "Here is your mother!" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/19/John-19-26.html"&gt;John 19:26-27&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the cross, Jesus sees His mother Mary standing nearby, along with the Apostle John. He entrusts the care of His mother to John, ensuring she will be looked after. Even in His suffering, Jesus displays compassion and concern for those He loves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Jesus' care for His mother exemplifies His compassion and teaches us to prioritize the needs of our loved ones, even in difficult circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; How can you demonstrate love and care for those close to you, particularly in times of hardship? What can you learn from Jesus' example?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;6. "I am thirsty" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/19/John-19-28.html"&gt;John 19:28&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By declaring His thirst, Jesus fulfills the Messianic prophecy found in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/69/Psalm-69-21.html"&gt;Psalm 69:21&lt;/a&gt;. This statement prompts the Roman guards to give Him vinegar, as was customary during crucifixions. It serves as a fulfillment of Scripture and underscores Jesus' role as the Messiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Jesus' fulfillment of prophecy confirms His identity as the long-awaited Messiah. It reminds us that every detail of His life and death was part of God's divine plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; How does Jesus' fulfillment of prophecy strengthen your faith? How does it deepen your trust in God's sovereignty?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;7. "It is finished!" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/19/John-19-30.html"&gt;John 19:30&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These words signify the completion of Jesus' mission on earth. He declares that His suffering is over and that He has accomplished the work His Father gave Him to do. Through His life, death, and resurrection, Jesus has paid the debt of sin and obtained eternal salvation for all who believe in Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Jesus' declaration of "It is finished!" assures us that salvation is complete and available through faith in Him. It reminds us that our salvation is not based on our works but on His finished work on the cross.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; How does this statement impact your understanding of salvation? How does it encourage you to live out your faith?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, the seven sayings of Christ on the cross hold deep significance for Christians. They reveal Jesus' love, forgiveness, trust, compassion, and fulfillment of prophecy. As we reflect on these statements, may our hearts be filled with gratitude for the immense sacrifice of Jesus and the hope we have in Him.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Jesus Christ/The Cross and the Empty Tomb/On the Cross"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>The Divine Sacrifice: Understanding the Crucifixion in Christianity</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/crucifixion/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-08-18T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-08-18T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-08-18:/crucifixion/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Crucifixion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crucifixion is a form of execution by torture that was "perfected" by the Romans and used as a deterrent to prevent people from crossing the Roman government. It was invented by other people groups, such as the Persians, Assyrians, Greeks, and Carthaginians, but the Romans took it to new levels of horror.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Process of Crucifixion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The victim of crucifixion would first be severely scourged or beaten, an ordeal that was life-threatening on its own. After this brutal beating, the victim would be forced to carry the large wooden crossbeam to the site of crucifixion, adding physical pain and shame as they carried the instrument of their own torture and death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once at the place of crucifixion, the victim would be stripped naked to further shame them. Their arms would be stretched out on the crossbeam and nailed in place. The nails were hammered through the wrists, not the palms, to prevent them from pulling through. The placement of the nails in the wrists also caused excruciating pain as they pressed on large nerves running to the hands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The crossbeam would then be hoisted up and fastened to an upright piece that remained standing between crucifixions. The victim's feet would also be nailed to the cross, one foot on top of the other, through the middle and arch of each foot, with slightly bent knees. The primary purpose of these nails was to inflict pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Agony and Torture&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once fastened to the cross, all of the victim's weight was supported by three nails, causing pain to shoot throughout their body. The victim's arms were stretched out in a way that caused cramping and paralysis in the chest muscles, making it impossible to breathe unless some weight was borne by their feet. In order to take a breath, they had to push up with their feet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As they tried to breathe and relieve some of the pain in their feet, the victim would begin to slump down again, putting more weight on their wrists and rubbing their raw back against the cross. However, in this lowered position, they could not breathe, so the torturous process would repeat. The victim had to constantly push up with their feet to breathe and relieve some of the pain caused by the wrist nails, while also enduring the intense pain caused by the foot nail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EpFhS0dAduc" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crucifixion usually led to a slow, tortuous death, with some victims lasting as long as four days on the cross. Death came from asphyxiation as the victim lost the strength to continue pushing up on their feet to take a breath. In some cases, the victim's legs might be broken to hasten death by preventing them from pushing up to breathe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the brutal nature of crucifixion helps us grasp the immense suffering that Jesus endured for our salvation. The crucifixion was not only physically agonizing but also deeply humiliating. Jesus willingly endured this excruciating death on the cross because of His great love for us. His sacrifice provides a way for us to be forgiven and reconciled with God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take a moment to reflect on the extreme pain and humiliation that Jesus experienced during His crucifixion. Consider how His willingness to endure this horrific death demonstrates His sacrificial love for humanity. How does knowing about the details of crucifixion deepen your appreciation for Jesus' sacrifice on your behalf?&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Jesus Christ/The Cross and the Empty Tomb/On the Cross"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>How Jesus Died: Revealing the Ultimate Sacrifice</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/how-did-jesus-die/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-08-15T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-08-15T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-08-15:/how-did-jesus-die/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;How Did Jesus Die?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The crucifixion of Jesus Christ is a pivotal event in human history. It represents His ultimate sacrifice for the sins of humanity and is the foundation of Christianity. But what exactly led to Jesus' death? What were the physical factors that contributed to His crucifixion? In this article, we will explore the details surrounding Jesus' death, examining the biblical accounts and medical perspectives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Agony in the Garden&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the Last Supper, Jesus went to pray in the Garden of Gethsemane. He was fully aware of the physical trauma He was about to endure. In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/26/Matthew-26-39.html"&gt;Matthew 26:39&lt;/a&gt;, Jesus prayed, "My Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me; nevertheless, not as I will, but as you will." Despite knowing the agony that awaited Him, Jesus submitted to the Father's will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During His intense prayer, Luke describes a rare medical condition known as hematidrosis. This condition occurs when extreme stress causes blood vessels in the sweat glands to rupture. Luke writes that "His sweat became like great drops of blood falling down to the ground" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/22/Luke-22-44.html"&gt;Luke 22:44&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Trials and Beatings&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After His arrest in the garden, Jesus was taken before a Jewish court where He was found guilty of blasphemy. The guards then beat Him (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/14/Mark-14-65.html"&gt;Mark 14:65&lt;/a&gt;). Early in the morning, Jesus was brought before Pilate, the Roman governor of the province (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/15/Mark-15-1.html"&gt;Mark 15:1&lt;/a&gt;). Pilate found no fault in Jesus and attempted to release Him but succumbed to pressure from the crowd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pilate had Jesus scourged before handing Him over to be crucified. Scourging was a severe form of flogging reserved for those condemned to death. Roman soldiers used a flagrum, a short whip with leather thongs attached to fragments of metal, bone, or lead. Each strike embedded the sharp fragments into the skin, tearing away chunks of flesh. This brutal punishment caused immense pain, shock, and blood loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Journey to Golgotha&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the scourging, Jesus was forced to carry His cross to the place of execution. Already weakened from the beatings and lack of sleep, Jesus collapsed multiple times under the weight. Simon of Cyrene was then pressed into service to help carry the cross (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/15/Mark-15-21.html"&gt;Mark 15:21&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon reaching Golgotha, Jesus was stripped of His clothing and laid on the ground with the crossbeam beneath His shoulders. Large iron nails, approximately 5 to 7 inches long, were driven through His wrists. These nails were placed at the point where the wrist meets the hand, between the radius and ulna bones. This location supported the weight of the body without tearing through the flesh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/U_rzCrR4JJo" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The soldiers then lifted and fixed the crossbeam to an upright post called the stipe already positioned in the ground. Jesus' feet were nailed to the stipe by placing one foot over the other and driving a single large nail through both feet into the wood. This position required Jesus to push up on the nail in order to breathe, causing excruciating pain with every breath.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Physical Agonies&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The combination of shock, blood loss, and inability to breathe caused a slow and agonizing death. The factors contributing to Jesus' death could have included asphyxiation, heart failure, and hypovolemic shock. Asphyxiation occurs when a person is unable to get enough oxygen due to their position or physical condition. Hanging on the cross with outstretched arms made breathing difficult for Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, crucifixion put immense strain on the heart. As Jesus hung on the cross, His heart had to work harder to pump blood against gravity. This increased workload could have led to heart failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, Jesus experienced hypovolemic shock due to the extreme blood loss from the scourging and crucifixion. This shock occurs when there is a significant loss of blood or fluid, leading to a drop in blood pressure and inadequate organ perfusion. The combination of these physical agonies would have caused immense suffering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Jesus' Final Moments&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After enduring unimaginable torment for approximately six hours, Jesus cried out with a loud voice, "Father, into your hands I commit my spirit" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/23/Luke-23-46.html"&gt;Luke 23:46&lt;/a&gt;). With these words, He breathed His last breath. As Jesus had earlier taught, "No one takes [My life] from me, but I lay it down of my own accord" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/10/John-10-18.html"&gt;John 10:18&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following His death, a soldier pierced Jesus' side with a spear to confirm His death. "A sudden flow of blood and water" gushed from His body (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/19/John-19-34.html"&gt;John 19:34&lt;/a&gt;), indicating that Jesus had indeed died from the trauma inflicted upon Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the details of Jesus' crucifixion helps us grasp the gravity of His sacrifice. It reminds us of the immense love and obedience Jesus demonstrated by willingly enduring such physical torment for our sake. Jesus' death on the cross provides the opportunity for salvation and reconciliation with God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take a moment to reflect on what Jesus endured during His crucifixion. Consider the physical agony He experienced and the profound love He displayed through His sacrifice. How does this deepen your understanding of God's love for you? How can you respond to this sacrificial love in your own life?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The temple in Jerusalem held a significant place in the religious life of Jews during the time of Jesus. It was the center for animal sacrifices and the practice of faithful worship according to the Law of Moses. Within the temple, there was a veil that separated the Holy of Holies, where God's presence resided, from the rest of the temple where people dwelt. This veil symbolized the separation between man and God due to sin. Only the high priest was allowed to enter beyond this veil once a year to make atonement for the sins of Israel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Size and Significance of the Veil&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The veil in the temple was an impressive structure, measuring around 60 feet high. While early Jewish tradition suggests that it was about four inches thick, the Bible does not provide an exact confirmation of this measurement. The veil was made from blue, purple, and scarlet material, as well as fine twisted linen, according to the book of Exodus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The size and thickness of the veil make the events surrounding Jesus' death all the more significant. At the moment Jesus gave up His spirit on the cross, something remarkable occurred: "the curtain of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/27/Matthew-27-50.html"&gt;Matthew 27:50&lt;/a&gt;-51a). This tearing of the veil held deep symbolic meaning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Significance of the Torn Veil&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tearing of the veil at Jesus' death symbolized that His sacrifice—the shedding of His own blood—was sufficient for atoning for sins. It signified that now, access to the Holy of Holies was open to all people for all time, both Jews and Gentiles. The tearing of the veil represented a profound shift in how humanity could approach God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previously, only the high priest could enter beyond the veil into God's presence. But with Jesus' death and the tearing of the veil, a new way opened up. &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/10/Hebrews-10-19.html"&gt;Hebrews 10:19-20&lt;/a&gt; explains, "We have confidence to enter the Most Holy Place by the blood of Jesus by a new and living way opened for us through the curtain, that is, his body." Through Jesus, we now have direct access to God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Veil and Christ's Role&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The veil in the temple represented Christ Himself as the only way to the Father. Just as the high priest had to pass through the veil to enter the Holy of Holies, now, through Jesus, we can enter into God's presence. Jesus is our superior High Priest, and as believers in His finished work, we partake in His better priesthood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_OsJoVZIILs" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tearing of the veil also holds broader significance. In Hebrews, it is explained that the temple and its religious system were shadows of things to come, ultimately pointing to Jesus Christ. His death removed the barriers between God and humanity. The constant reminder of sin's separation from God that the veil represented was no longer necessary because Jesus had made a way for us to approach God freely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the torn temple veil holds immense importance for Christians today. It signifies that salvation and access to God are available to all who believe in Jesus' sacrifice. It emphasizes that no longer do we need an intermediary like a high priest or a physical temple to approach God. Instead, we can have a personal relationship with Him through faith in Jesus Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The torn veil also highlights the significance of Jesus' role as our High Priest and Savior. It underscores His unique position as the only way to God and encourages us to place our trust in Him alone for salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reflecting on the torn temple veil prompts us to consider several important points:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The seriousness of sin: The separation symbolized by the veil reminds us of the devastating effects of sin and our need for redemption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sufficiency of Christ's sacrifice: The tearing of the veil declares that Jesus' sacrifice on the cross was enough to atone for our sins and provide access to God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our access to God: Through faith in Jesus, we now have direct access to God's presence. We can approach Him with confidence and boldness, knowing that Jesus has made a way for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The end of the Old Covenant: The tearing of the veil signifies the passing away of the old covenant and the establishment of the new covenant through Jesus Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The centrality of Jesus: Just as the veil represented Christ, we are reminded that He is central to our faith and the only means by which we can approach and know God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, the tearing of the temple veil at the moment of Jesus' death holds immense significance for believers. It signifies that through His sacrifice, we have access to God and are no longer separated from Him by sin. The torn veil symbolizes a new way—a personal relationship with God through Jesus Christ. It calls us to reflect on sin, trust in Christ's sacrifice, and embrace the privilege of direct access to God.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Jesus Christ/The Cross and the Empty Tomb/On the Cross"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Understanding Jesus' Suffering: A Deep Dive into His Sacrifice</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/jesus-suffering/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-06-26T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-06-26T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-06-26:/jesus-suffering/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Jesus' Suffering&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus endured immense suffering during His trials, torture, and crucifixion. His suffering was not only physical but also emotional and spiritual. Physically, Jesus' appearance was so disfigured that people were appalled at Him. He was beaten and tortured beyond recognition. Emotionally, all of His disciples deserted Him and fled, leaving Him to face His suffering alone. Spiritually, Jesus carried the weight of the sins of the entire world on His shoulders. He became sin for us and experienced the feeling of being forsaken by God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The prophet Isaiah had predicted Jesus' suffering, describing Him as a man of sorrows who would be despised and rejected by men. Isaiah also foretold that Jesus would be pierced for our transgressions and crushed for our iniquities. This suffering would bring peace and healing to those who believe in Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus Himself told His disciples that He must suffer many things, be rejected, and be killed, but would rise again on the third day. His suffering was part of God's plan for the salvation of humanity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The suffering of Jesus can be seen in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/22/Psalm-22-14.html"&gt;Psalm 22:14-18&lt;/a&gt;, which describes Him being poured out like water, with all His bones out of joint. He experiences weakness and thirst, surrounded by enemies who pierce His hands and feet. People stare and gloat over Him, dividing His garments among themselves and casting lots for His clothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But why did Jesus have to suffer so greatly? The principle of the innocent dying for the guilty was established in the garden of Eden when Adam and Eve received garments made from animal skins to cover their shame. This required shedding blood as a sacrifice. Later, this principle was emphasized in the Mosaic Law, stating that it is the shedding of blood that makes atonement for one's life. Jesus had to suffer because suffering is an integral part of sacrifice, and He is the ultimate sacrificial Lamb of God who takes away the sins of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The suffering of Jesus on the cross reveals the devastating nature of sin, the wrath of God, the cruelty of humanity, and the hatred of Satan. At Calvary, mankind was allowed to do its worst to Jesus as He became the Redeemer of humanity. Satan may have thought he had won a great victory, but it was through the cross that Jesus triumphed over Satan, sin, and death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus' suffering and death secured salvation for all who would believe in Him. In Gethsemane, Jesus prayed to God, asking if there was any other way for salvation to be accomplished. However, He submitted to God's will and drank the cup of suffering for us. There was no other way for us to be saved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/U_rzCrR4JJo" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding Jesus' suffering is crucial for Christians because it shows the extent of God's love for humanity. Jesus willingly endured immense pain and suffering to provide salvation for all who believe in Him. His sacrifice demonstrates the seriousness of sin and offers hope and forgiveness to those who trust in Him. Recognizing the depth of Jesus' suffering can deepen our gratitude, strengthen our faith, and inspire us to live lives that honor Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reflect on the physical, emotional, and spiritual suffering that Jesus endured. How does this impact your understanding of His love for you?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consider how Jesus' suffering fulfilled prophecies from Isaiah and Psalms. How does this strengthen your faith in the reliability and trustworthiness of Scripture?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Meditate on the fact that there was no other way for us to be saved except through Jesus' suffering and death. How does this reaffirm your belief in Him as your Savior?&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The precise location of where Jesus was crucified is a matter of debate among scholars. According to the Gospels, Jesus was crucified at a place called Golgotha, which means "place of the skull." This is mentioned in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/27/Matthew-27-33.html"&gt;Matthew 27:33&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/15/Mark-15-22.html"&gt;Mark 15:22&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/23/Luke-23-33.html"&gt;Luke 23:33 …&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Where Was Jesus Crucified?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The precise location of where Jesus was crucified is a matter of debate among scholars. According to the Gospels, Jesus was crucified at a place called Golgotha, which means "place of the skull." This is mentioned in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/27/Matthew-27-33.html"&gt;Matthew 27:33&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/15/Mark-15-22.html"&gt;Mark 15:22&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/23/Luke-23-33.html"&gt;Luke 23:33&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/19/John-19-17.html"&gt;John 19:17&lt;/a&gt;. The Gospels provide a few clues about the location. &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/19/John-19-20.html"&gt;John 19:20&lt;/a&gt; states that it was "near the city," indicating that it was likely outside of the city walls. &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/15/Mark-15-40.html"&gt;Mark 15:40&lt;/a&gt; mentions that the location could be seen from a distance, suggesting that it was elevated. Additionally, &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/27/Matthew-27-39.html"&gt;Matthew 27:39&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/15/Mark-15-29.html"&gt;Mark 15:29&lt;/a&gt; describe the crucifixion site as accessible to passers-by.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two popular proposed sites for the location of Jesus' crucifixion. The first is the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, which has been traditionally accepted since the early fourth century AD based on the writings of Eusebius. The second is Gordon's Calvary, which was proposed in the mid-nineteenth century by Otto Thenius, Fisher Howe, and Claude Conder and popularized by Charles Gordon in the late nineteenth century.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Determining the exact location of Jesus' crucifixion is challenging due to significant changes that have occurred in Jerusalem over the past two thousand years. The city has been destroyed and rebuilt multiple times, making it difficult to ascertain whether the Church of the Holy Sepulchre or Gordon's Calvary aligns with the original location. While the Church of the Holy Sepulchre is currently within the city walls, it may have been outside of the walls during the early first century. Similarly, Gordon's Calvary may have undergone changes over time due to quarrying work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tKu9KgiCIg4" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, it is important to note that the exact location of where Jesus was crucified does not hold spiritual significance or carry promised blessings. Regardless of the location, there is no biblical reason to revere it. Our proximity to God is not dependent on being at the tomb beneath the Church of the Holy Sepulchre or on top of Gordon's Calvary, but rather through our faith in Jesus Christ and his crucifixion, burial, and resurrection (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-Corinthians/15/1-Corinthians-15-3.html"&gt;1 Corinthians 15:3&lt;/a&gt;–4).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The location of Jesus' crucifixion is a topic of interest for many Christians, as it adds historical context to the events surrounding Jesus' death and resurrection. While the debate over the exact location continues, it is important to remember that our faith in Jesus does not rely on physical places or relics. Our relationship with God is based on our trust in Jesus' sacrifice for our sins and his victory over death through his resurrection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the historical context and different theories surrounding Jesus' crucifixion can deepen our appreciation for the significance of his sacrifice. It allows us to reflect on the immense love and grace that God demonstrated by sending his Son to die for our sins. The crucifixion serves as a powerful reminder of God's redemptive plan and the extent to which he was willing to go to reconcile humanity to himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reflect on what it means for our faith that the exact location of Jesus' crucifixion remains uncertain. How does this impact your understanding of the significance of the crucifixion?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consider how knowing the historical context and different theories about Jesus' crucifixion can enhance your understanding and appreciation of God's redemptive plan.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Discuss with others how our faith in Jesus is not dependent on physical places or relics, but rather on the work he accomplished through his death and resurrection. How does this perspective shape your approach to worship and spiritual practices?&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cross holds a special place in Christianity as one of the most beloved symbols. It is seen in churches, jewelry, books, and various other forms of expression. The empty cross represents the work of our Savior, Jesus Christ, who willingly gave His life to pay for our sins. When Jesus uttered the words "It is finished" before His death (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/19/John-19-30.html"&gt;John 19:30&lt;/a&gt;), He signified the fulfillment of the Law, the completion of Messianic prophecies related to His first coming, and the accomplishment of redemption. The cross has become a symbol that encapsulates the greatest story ever told—the sacrificial death of Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Shape of the Cross&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the Bible does not explicitly describe the precise shape of the object on which Jesus was crucified, it does use the Greek word "stauros," which refers to a pole or cross used as an instrument of capital punishment. The corresponding verb "stauroó" means "to be attached to a pole or cross." Outside of the Bible, this verb was also used in the context of putting up a fence with stakes. Although "stauros" can mean either "pole" or "stake," many scholars argue that Jesus likely died on a cross where the upright beam projected above the shorter crosspiece. However, it is important to note that an airtight biblical case cannot be made for either a cross or a pole/stake. Historical records show that Romans crucified people using various objects such as crosses, poles, stakes, upside-down crosses, X-shaped crosses, walls, roofs, and more. The specific shape on which Jesus was crucified does not affect the perfection or sufficiency of His sacrifice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Countering Alternative Views&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Certain groups, such as Jehovah's Witnesses, vehemently assert that Jesus did not die on a cross and claim that the cross is a pagan symbol. However, their position is curious given the ambiguity of the Greek word "stauros." Additionally, they deny the deity of Christ and His bodily resurrection, further questioning their objections to traditional Christian beliefs. It is important to examine alternative views with an open mind and consider the evidence presented in the Bible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Clues in the New Testament&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the Bible does not provide a direct description of the shape of the cross, there are some indirect clues that suggest Jesus was crucified on a cross. In John 21, Jesus gives Peter a glimpse of the manner of his death, saying, "'When you are old, you will stretch out your hands, and someone else will dress you and lead you where you do not want to go.' Jesus said this to indicate the kind of death by which Peter would glorify God" (verses 18-19). The mention of Peter stretching out his hands implies that Roman crucifixion typically involved outspread arms positioned on a crosspiece. Another clue can be found in John 20 when Thomas doubts Jesus' resurrection. Thomas says, "Unless I see the nail marks in his hands and put my finger where the nails were, and put my hand into his side, I will not believe" (verse 25). Thomas' mention of nail marks in Jesus' hands suggests a traditional cross since a stake or pole would require only one nail. These indirect clues indicate that Jesus was likely crucified on a cross.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Significance of the Cross&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While debates about the shape of the cross may continue, it is crucial to remember the significance it holds for believers. Jesus instructed His followers, saying, "If anyone would come after me, he must deny himself and take up his cross and follow me. For whoever wants to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for me will find it" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/16/Matthew-16-24.html"&gt;Matthew 16:24&lt;/a&gt;–25). The cross, regardless of its shape, was an instrument of death. By calling us to take up our cross and follow Him, Jesus teaches that true followers must die to self. This involves crucifying self-righteousness, self-promotion, and selfish ambitions in order to be His disciples. While martyrdom may represent the extreme form of losing our lives for Christ's sake, even in peaceful times, we must be willing to let go of ourselves. Those who are not willing to do so are "not worthy" of Him (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/10/Matthew-10-38.html"&gt;Matthew 10:38&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/s2H6_QZZUMc" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the shape of the cross is not a matter of salvation or the core doctrines of Christianity. The Bible does not explicitly state the exact shape, and it does not affect the essential truths of Jesus' sacrificial death and resurrection. While it is interesting to explore historical and biblical evidence regarding the shape of the cross, our focus should always remain on the significance of Jesus' sacrifice and our response as His followers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reflecting on the symbolism of the cross, what does it mean for you personally to take up your cross and follow Jesus? How can you apply this concept in your daily life? Consider areas where self-centeredness may hinder your ability to fully embrace the call to deny yourself and live for Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, while the precise shape of the object on which Jesus was crucified cannot be definitively determined from the Bible, historical evidence suggests that He likely died on a cross. However, regardless of its shape, the cross represents the sacrificial death of Jesus Christ and holds deep significance for Christians. It reminds us to deny ourselves and follow Him, allowing His love and teachings to transform our lives.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Jesus Christ/The Cross and the Empty Tomb/On the Cross"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Jesus' Blood Water: The Ultimate Redemption Story Unveiled</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/blood-water-jesus/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-05-09T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-05-09T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-05-09:/blood-water-jesus/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;The Flogging of Jesus: Understanding His Sacrifice&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The crucifixion of Jesus Christ is a central event in Christian theology, representing the ultimate sacrifice for the sins of humanity. Before Jesus was crucified, he endured a brutal and agonizing flogging or scourging. In this article, we will explore the details of the flogging that Jesus endured, the physical effects it had on his body, and the significance of this event in understanding his sacrifice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Roman Flogging&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Roman flogging that Jesus underwent prior to his crucifixion was a horrific form of punishment. It typically involved 39 lashes with a whip known as a flagrum. This whip consisted of braided leather thongs with metal balls and sharp pieces of bone woven into them. When used, the weight of the balls caused deep bruising, while the sharp bones cut into the flesh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the flogging continued, the cuts became so severe that they exposed the skeletal muscles, veins, sinews, and even parts of the bowels. The pain inflicted during this process was excruciating, and it is important to recognize the immense physical suffering that Jesus endured.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Hypovolemic Shock: The Effects on Jesus' Body&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the consequences of such a severe flogging was hypovolemic shock, which refers to low blood volume. The intense beating inflicted on Jesus caused significant blood loss, leading to a series of physiological responses within his body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Increased Heart Rate:&lt;/strong&gt; As blood volume decreased, Jesus' heart raced to pump blood that was no longer there. This rapid heartbeat was an attempt by his body to compensate for the loss of blood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Low Blood Pressure and Fainting:&lt;/strong&gt; Due to the diminished blood volume, Jesus would have experienced low blood pressure. This would have caused him to collapse or faint as his body struggled to maintain circulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kidney Shutdown:&lt;/strong&gt; In order to preserve body fluids, the kidneys would have shut down in response to hypovolemic shock. This further exacerbated the overall state of Jesus' body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Extreme Thirst:&lt;/strong&gt; As a result of the fluid loss, Jesus would have experienced extreme thirst. His body desperately needed to replenish lost fluids, leading to a profound sense of dehydration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Evidence from Scripture&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The accounts in the Gospels provide evidence that Jesus indeed suffered from hypovolemic shock as a result of the flogging. As Jesus carried his own cross to Golgotha, he collapsed along the way. Simon of Cyrene was then forced to either carry the cross or help Jesus carry it the rest of the way up the hill (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/27/Matthew-27-32.html"&gt;Matthew 27:32&lt;/a&gt;–33; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/15/Mark-15-21.html"&gt;Mark 15:21&lt;/a&gt;–22; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/23/Luke-23-26.html"&gt;Luke 23:26&lt;/a&gt;). This collapse is a clear indication that Jesus had low blood pressure, a symptom of hypovolemic shock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another indicator of Jesus' suffering is found in his words on the cross. He expressed his thirst, stating, "I am thirsty" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/19/John-19-28.html"&gt;John 19:28&lt;/a&gt;). This statement reveals his body's desperate need for fluids as it attempted to replenish what had been lost through the flogging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BYjhGeAIG6k" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The Piercing of Jesus' Side&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Jesus died on the cross, a Roman soldier thrust a spear into his side, piercing both his lungs and heart (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/19/John-19-34.html"&gt;John 19:34&lt;/a&gt;). This act resulted in blood and water flowing out from his side. The medical explanation for this phenomenon lies in the context of hypovolemic shock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prior to death, sustained rapid heartbeat caused by hypovolemic shock leads to the accumulation of fluid around the heart (pericardial effusion) and lungs (pleural effusion). When the spear pierced Jesus' side, it released this gathered fluid, resulting in blood and water flowing out together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the physical suffering endured by Jesus during his flogging helps us grasp the extent of his sacrifice. Jesus willingly endured immense pain and humiliation, allowing his body to be broken for our sake. This demonstrates the depths of God's love and the lengths to which he was willing to go to redeem humanity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By recognizing the physical torment Jesus experienced, we can approach the crucifixion with a deeper appreciation for its significance. The sacrifice made on the cross was not only spiritual but also physical, demonstrating the fullness of Christ's love and the magnitude of his atonement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The flogging and crucifixion of Jesus serve as a reminder of the gravity of sin and the cost of redemption. Reflecting on the physical suffering endured by Jesus can deepen our gratitude and understanding of his sacrifice. As we contemplate his wounds and the blood shed for our sins, may it lead us to a greater commitment to live in a manner worthy of this incredible sacrifice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, the flogging that Jesus underwent before his crucifixion was a brutal and agonizing experience. It resulted in hypovolemic shock, causing Jesus to suffer from low blood pressure, collapse, extreme thirst, and other physiological responses. The significance of this event cannot be overstated, as it underscores the extent of Jesus' sacrifice and serves as a powerful reminder of God's love for humanity.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Jesus Christ/The Cross and the Empty Tomb/On the Cross"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>When Was Jesus Crucified: Revealing the Sacred Hour</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/what-time-was-jesus-crucified/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-05-08T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-05-08T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-05-08:/what-time-was-jesus-crucified/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;What Time Was Jesus Crucified?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The timing of Jesus' crucifixion is a topic that has been examined by scholars and theologians, as the gospel accounts provide various references to the time of day. By considering all the information provided by the gospel writers, we can gain an understanding of when Jesus was crucified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1. Arrest and Morning Proceedings&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/27/Matthew-27-1.html"&gt;Matthew 27:1&lt;/a&gt;–2, Jesus was arrested at night and brought before the chief priests and elders of the people on the following morning. They bound Him and delivered Him to Pilate, the governor. This sets the stage for the events leading up to Jesus' crucifixion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2. Hearings Before Pilate and Herod&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After being brought before Pilate, there were a series of hearings involving both Pilate and Herod. &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/23/Luke-23-6.html"&gt;Luke 23:6&lt;/a&gt;–15 mentions Herod's involvement, as he was in Jerusalem for the Passover. However, Pilate had the final decision-making authority. Although Pilate initially wanted to release Jesus (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/23/Luke-23-20.html"&gt;Luke 23:20&lt;/a&gt;), he ultimately chose to appease the crowd. In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/27/Matthew-27-24.html"&gt;Matthew 27:24&lt;/a&gt;–26, we see that Pilate handed Jesus over to be crucified after having Him scourged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;3. The Time Clues in Matthew&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matthew provides some clues about the time of Jesus' crucifixion. In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/27/Matthew-27-45.html"&gt;Matthew 27:45&lt;/a&gt;–51, it is stated that darkness fell upon all the land from about the sixth hour until the ninth hour. It was during this time that Jesus cried out with a loud voice and yielded up His spirit. Therefore, according to Matthew, Jesus died "about the ninth hour."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;4. Agreement Among the Synoptic Gospels&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/23/Luke-23-44.html"&gt;Luke 23:44&lt;/a&gt;–47 agrees with Matthew's account of darkness from the sixth hour until the ninth hour and Jesus' death around that time. &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/15/Mark-15-25.html"&gt;Mark 15:25&lt;/a&gt; adds further information, stating that Jesus was crucified at the third hour. The rest of Mark's account aligns with Matthew and Luke in terms of the times of darkness and Jesus' death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;5. Reckoning Time in Ancient Times&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to understand that ancient timekeeping methods were imprecise compared to modern standards. Before the use of watches and precise timekeeping devices, people would often estimate and round off the time. The day was typically divided into three-hour blocks, and individuals would estimate the time based on their observations. Therefore, when different observers glanced up at the sun moving toward mid-heaven, one might have considered it the third hour while another might have called it about the sixth hour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;6. John's Unique Perspective&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John's account in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/19/John-19-13.html"&gt;John 19:13&lt;/a&gt;–14 seems to differ from the other gospel writers regarding the timing of certain events. John places the hearing before Pilate at about the sixth hour, which conflicts with Mark's account of Jesus' crucifixion at the third hour. Various solutions have been proposed to reconcile this discrepancy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aNk04RtMnPc" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One solution suggests that John may be using a different method of time reckoning that counts hours from midnight (the "Roman" method). However, this is unlikely since John's other time references align with the traditional sunup-to-sundown frame of reference. Another proposed solution is to attribute John's mention of the sixth hour to a scribal error, but there is no manuscript evidence to support this theory. Some scholars suggest that John may be making a theological point rather than providing a literal indication of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;7. Theological Implications&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While determining the exact timing of Jesus' crucifixion may be challenging due to imprecise ancient timekeeping methods and differing perspectives among the gospel writers, it is crucial to recognize that the gospel accounts focus more on theological implications than precise chronology. The writers were primarily concerned with conveying the significance of Jesus' death and its fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the timing of Jesus' crucifixion can deepen our appreciation for the events that unfolded on that pivotal day. It allows us to reflect on the significance of Jesus' sacrifice and His willingness to endure suffering for our sake. By exploring the different perspectives presented in the gospel accounts, we can gain a more comprehensive understanding of the narrative and its theological implications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider the varying perspectives presented in the gospel accounts regarding the timing of Jesus' crucifixion. How does this remind you of the uniqueness and diversity of the four gospel narratives? Reflect on the theological significance of Jesus' sacrifice and how it impacts your own faith journey.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Jesus Christ/The Cross and the Empty Tomb/On the Cross"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Jesus on the Cross: The Ultimate Sacrifice for Redemption</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/jesus-on-the-cross/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-04-30T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-04-30T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-04-30:/jesus-on-the-cross/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Jesus on the Cross&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The crucifixion of Jesus is a significant event in Christian theology and is described in the Gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. Jesus was crucified as a means of execution by the ancient Roman Empire for those found guilty of capital offenses. It was a method reserved for slaves, foreigners, insurrectionists, and individuals guilty of heinous crimes. In the case of Jesus, the Jewish leaders accused Him of inciting rebellion and claiming to be the King of Israel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Crucifixion as a Method of Execution&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crucifixion was not only intended to bring about death but also to serve as a deterrent for others. The victims of crucifixion were subjected to humiliation and often left completely naked. In Jewish Law, crucifixion was considered a curse. The term "excruciating" literally means "out of crucifying," highlighting the excruciating pain and slow death associated with this form of execution. Depending on the circumstances, individuals could suffer for days after being nailed to a cross.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Time Jesus Spent on the Cross&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Determining the exact duration of Jesus' time on the cross can be somewhat complex due to the different systems of marking time used in the Gospels. Matthew, Mark, and Luke use the Jewish system, whereas John uses the Roman system. However, by examining these accounts together, we can approximate the duration of Jesus' crucifixion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Mark's Gospel, Jesus was crucified at 9:00 A.M., which is referred to as the third hour using the Jewish system of marking time (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/15/Mark-15-24.html"&gt;Mark 15:24&lt;/a&gt;–25). Matthew adds that darkness covered the land from noon until 3:00 P.M., known as the sixth hour to the Jewish system (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/27/Matthew-27-45.html"&gt;Matthew 27:45&lt;/a&gt;). At around 3:00 P.M., Jesus cried out loudly and gave up His spirit, indicating His death (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/27/Matthew-27-50.html"&gt;Matthew 27:50&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, John mentions that Jesus' trial before Pontius Pilate was taking place at about the sixth hour according to the Roman system of marking time (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/19/John-19-14.html"&gt;John 19:14&lt;/a&gt;). As the Romans counted their hours from midnight, the "sixth hour" would correspond to 6:00 A.M. Therefore, Jesus' trial ended around 6:00 A.M., and His crucifixion began approximately three hours later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Combining these details, we can conclude that Jesus was on the cross for approximately six hours, from 9:00 A.M. until 3:00 P.M.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/n_Oc9EG2dfg" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the duration of Jesus' time on the cross is significant because it highlights the immense suffering He endured for the salvation of humanity. His crucifixion was not only a physical torment but also a spiritual sacrifice. By willingly offering Himself as a sacrifice, Jesus demonstrated His love for humanity and fulfilled the prophecies concerning the Messiah's death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The crucifixion is central to Christian theology as it represents Jesus' redemptive work on the cross. It is through His sacrificial death that believers find forgiveness for their sins and receive salvation. Recognizing the extent of Jesus' suffering deepens our understanding of His love and sacrifice, inspiring gratitude and devotion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reflecting on the crucifixion of Jesus can evoke profound emotions and contemplation. Consider the following points:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sacrificial Love:&lt;/strong&gt; Contemplate the depth of Jesus' love for humanity, as He willingly endured such excruciating pain and humiliation on the cross.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Salvation:&lt;/strong&gt; Ponder the significance of Jesus' sacrifice in providing salvation for all who believe in Him. How does this impact your faith journey?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gratitude:&lt;/strong&gt; Express gratitude for Jesus' sacrifice and reflect on how it has personally affected your life.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Cross as a Symbol:&lt;/strong&gt; Consider the symbolism of the cross in Christian faith. How does it remind you of Jesus' sacrifice and inspire you in your own life?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By engaging with these thoughts, we can deepen our appreciation for the crucifixion and its transformative power in our lives as Christians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cross holds deep significance for Christians, representing the intersection of God's love and justice. However, before understanding its current meaning, it is crucial to grasp the historical context. In ancient times, the cross was an instrument of execution used to inflict slow, excruciatingly painful deaths. In crucifixion, individuals were either tied or nailed to a wooden cross and left to hang until they perished. The word "crucifixion" itself means "out of crucifying." &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The meaning of the cross shifted dramatically because of Jesus Christ's sacrifice. In Christianity, the cross symbolizes God's plan for redemption. Jesus is often referred to as the Lamb of God, an allusion to the Jewish Passover ritual described in Exodus 12. During this event, the Israelites were commanded to sacrifice an unblemished lamb and apply its blood on their doorposts. This blood acted as a sign for the Angel of Death to "pass over" those homes, ensuring safety. When Jesus came to be baptized by John, he was identified as the Lamb of God who would take away the sin of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/z1mcW0RSW7w" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But why did Jesus have to die in the first place? The Bible tells the story of redemption, beginning with God creating the world and humanity in His image. However, due to Adam and Eve's temptation by Satan, they sinned against God and fell from His grace. Consequently, their sin and guilt passed on to all their descendants. To save His people, God sent His only Son, Jesus, into the world to take on human form and become their Savior. Born of a virgin, Jesus was free from the curse of sin that affects all other humans. As the sinless Son of God, He could provide the unblemished sacrifice required by God's justice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through Jesus' sacrificial death on the cross, those who have faith in Him alone for salvation are guaranteed eternal life. This belief is encapsulated in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/3/John-3-16.html"&gt;John 3:16&lt;/a&gt;, which states, "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life." However, Jesus also called His followers to take up their cross and follow Him. This concept of "cross-bearing" has lost some of its original meaning in modern times, often used to denote inconveniences or difficulties. But Jesus intended it to symbolize radical self-denial and submission to God's will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Galatians/2/Galatians-2-20.html"&gt;Galatians 2:20&lt;/a&gt; further emphasizes the idea of dying to oneself and living in Christ: "I have been crucified with Christ. It is no longer I who live, but Christ who lives in me. And the life I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me." This verse highlights the transformative power of the cross, as believers are called to surrender their old selves and embrace a new life in Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While some Christians face persecution for their faith, even to the point of death, others are called to remain faithful in their daily lives. Regardless of whether one is called to make the ultimate sacrifice or not, the duty remains the same — to love and serve the One who saved us by giving His own life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the meaning of the cross is essential for Christians because it lies at the heart of their faith. The cross represents God's unfathomable love and His plan for redemption. Through Jesus' sacrifice on the cross, believers are offered forgiveness of sins and the promise of eternal life. Additionally, comprehending the significance of carrying one's cross helps Christians grasp the importance of self-denial and following Christ's example. It reminds them that their lives are no longer their own but belong to God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reflect on the meaning of the cross in your own life. How does it shape your understanding of God's love and justice?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consider the concept of "cross-bearing" in your daily life. In what ways can you practice self-denial and submission to God's will?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contemplate the sacrifice Jesus made on the cross. How does it inspire you to live a life that honors Him?&lt;/li&gt;

Some scientists argue that if …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Nails, Hands, and Wrists in the Crucifixion of Jesus&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In discussing the crucifixion of Jesus, one question that arises is where exactly the nails were placed. This question is closely tied to the debate surrounding whether Jesus was crucified on a cross, pole, or stake. Some scientists argue that if Jesus was crucified on a cross, as tradition states, the hands alone would not have been strong enough to hold His weight. Consequently, they suggest that the nails were actually driven through His wrists, which are considered stronger and more capable of supporting His body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, there are differing views on this matter. Some scholars propose that the hands would have been strong enough to bear the weight, considering that Jesus' feet were also nailed to support some of the burden. Additionally, historical evidence suggests that some crosses had a sort of seat attached to them, which would have helped support the weight of the person being crucified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While historical scholars remain uncertain about the precise placement of the nails in Jesus' crucifixion (or anyone else's for that matter), it is important to note that the Bible simply states that Jesus had wounds in His hands (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/20/John-20-25.html"&gt;John 20:25-27&lt;/a&gt;). The Greek word translated as "hands" in this context is "cheir," which literally means "hands." Interestingly, there is no Greek word for "wrists" in the New Testament, although some versions translate &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Acts/12/Acts-12-7.html"&gt;Acts 12:7&lt;/a&gt; to say that Peter's chains fell off his wrists. However, the Greek word used in this verse is also "cheir."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is possible that the nails may have been angled to enter through the hand and exit through the wrist, but it is equally likely that they were driven straight through the hand near the base of the thumb. Various experiments have shown that both methods could have been used in Jesus' crucifixion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LTHAwL8p9qU" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From a spiritual perspective, it is essential to recognize that the wounds of Christ hold infinite significance and are an integral part of His glory. However, the exact location of these wounds is a minor issue. What matters most is that we know there were five wounds - in His hands, side, and feet. Although we do not know the precise location on the hands, side, or feet, we understand that it is through His wounds that we find healing from sin (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/53/Isaiah-53-5.html"&gt;Isaiah 53:5&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-Peter/2/1-Peter-2-24.html"&gt;1 Peter 2:24&lt;/a&gt;). The wounds on Jesus' body brought about spiritual healing for all who believe in Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the details of Jesus' crucifixion and the placement of the nails helps us appreciate the immense sacrifice He made for our salvation. It also allows us to contemplate the physical pain and suffering He endured on our behalf. By delving into these aspects of Jesus' crucifixion, we gain a deeper understanding of His love and the magnitude of what He accomplished on the cross.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reflect on the significance of Jesus' wounds and how they provide spiritual healing for those who believe in Him.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consider how Jesus willingly endured physical pain and suffering to offer redemption to humanity. How does this impact your understanding of His love for you?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contemplate the importance of the crucifixion in your own faith journey and how it shapes your relationship with Jesus.&lt;/li&gt;

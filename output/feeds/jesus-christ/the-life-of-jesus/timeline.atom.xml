&lt;p&gt;The timeline of Jesus' life is a topic that has been the subject of much speculation and discussion. While none of the gospels present a chronological account of Jesus' life, we can still piece together a general framework based on the events described in the Bible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1. The Pre-Existent Jesus&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Gospel of John begins with the assertion that Jesus existed before the creation of the world (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/1/John-1-1.html"&gt;John 1:1-3&lt;/a&gt;). This highlights the divine nature of Jesus and sets the stage for His earthly ministry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2. Birth and Childhood&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luke provides an account of Jesus' birth in Bethlehem, including the visit of the shepherds on the same night (Luke 2). Matthew also mentions the visit of the wise men to the infant Jesus, which likely took place some time after His birth (Matthew 2). After this, Mary, Joseph, and Jesus fled to Egypt to escape King Herod's rage and later returned to Nazareth where Jesus grew up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One notable incident from Jesus' childhood is His visit to Jerusalem at the age of twelve. Mary and Joseph lost track of Him, only to find Him in the temple, astonishing those who heard Him speak (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/2/Luke-2-41.html"&gt;Luke 2:41-52&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;3. Beginning of Public Ministry&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The baptism of Jesus by John the Baptist marks the official beginning of His public ministry. Following His baptism, Jesus was tempted in the desert (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/3/Matthew-3-13.html"&gt;Matthew 3:13-4&lt;/a&gt;:11; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/1/Mark-1-9.html"&gt;Mark 1:9-13&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/3/Luke-3-21.html"&gt;Luke 3:21-4&lt;/a&gt;:13). This period of temptation prepared Him for the challenges He would face during His ministry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After His temptation, Jesus chose His disciples and embarked on an itinerant ministry, teaching and performing miracles throughout Galilee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;4. Ministry in Galilee and Trips to Jerusalem&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus spent a significant amount of time ministering in Galilee, making regular trips to Jerusalem for various feasts. These visits often led to conflicts with the Jewish leaders. Jesus performed many miracles, including healings and feedings, which revealed His divine power and authority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the precise duration of Jesus' ministry is uncertain, it is commonly believed to have lasted approximately three years based on the number of times Jesus went to Jerusalem for the Passover feast. However, this is speculative, as not all Passovers are recorded in the gospels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;5. Final Week in Jerusalem&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tZ5YeHbpeJU" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last week of Jesus' earthly ministry receives significant attention in all four gospels. This final week can be outlined as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Triumphal Entry&lt;/strong&gt;: Jesus entered Jerusalem on what is now celebrated as Palm Sunday, hailed by crowds waving palm branches and shouting praises (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/21/Matthew-21-1.html"&gt;Matthew 21:1-11&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/11/Mark-11-1.html"&gt;Mark 11:1-10&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/19/Luke-19-28.html"&gt;Luke 19:28-44&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/12/John-12-12.html"&gt;John 12:12-19&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teaching and Confrontation&lt;/strong&gt;: Jesus engaged in extended teaching to the crowds and confrontations with the religious leaders, culminating in the cleansing of the temple (Matthew 21-23; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/11/Mark-11-15.html"&gt;Mark 11:15-19&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/19/Luke-19-45.html"&gt;Luke 19:45-48&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Passover Meal and Betrayal&lt;/strong&gt;: Jesus observed the Passover meal with His disciples, during which He instituted the Lord's Supper and washed their feet. Judas left during the meal to betray Jesus to the Jewish leaders (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/26/Matthew-26-17.html"&gt;Matthew 26:17-30&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/14/Mark-14-12.html"&gt;Mark 14:12-26&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/22/Luke-22-7.html"&gt;Luke 22:7-38&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/13/John-13-1.html"&gt;John 13:1-38&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gethsemane and Arrest&lt;/strong&gt;: Jesus prayed in the Garden of Gethsemane while His disciples slept. He was then arrested by a group led by Judas Iscariot (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/26/Matthew-26-36.html"&gt;Matthew 26:36-56&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/14/Mark-14-32.html"&gt;Mark 14:32-52&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/22/Luke-22-39.html"&gt;Luke 22:39-53&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/18/John-18-1.html"&gt;John 18:1-12&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trials and Crucifixion&lt;/strong&gt;: Jesus faced a series of trials before the Jewish leaders, Pilate, and Herod. Despite Pilate's attempts to release Him, the crowd demanded His crucifixion. Jesus was sentenced to death and crucified (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/26/Matthew-26-57.html"&gt;Matthew 26:57-27&lt;/a&gt;:66; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/14/Mark-14-53.html"&gt;Mark 14:53-15&lt;/a&gt;:47; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/22/Luke-22-54.html"&gt;Luke 22:54-23&lt;/a&gt;:56; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/18/John-18-13.html"&gt;John 18:13-19&lt;/a&gt;:42).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Resurrection&lt;/strong&gt;: Jesus rose from the dead on the third day, which is celebrated as Easter Sunday (Matthew 28; Mark 16; Luke 24; John 20).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the timeline of Jesus' life helps us appreciate the significance of His ministry and sacrifice. It allows us to see how Jesus fulfilled prophecies, taught with authority, and ultimately offered Himself as a sacrifice for our sins. The events of His final week in Jerusalem, including His crucifixion and resurrection, are central to Christian faith and provide hope for salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we reflect on the timeline of Jesus' life, we can appreciate the meticulous details provided in the gospels. While they may not present a comprehensive chronological account, these accounts were carefully selected and arranged to convey essential truths about Jesus' identity and mission. Rather than getting caught up in the exact sequence of events, let us focus on understanding the message and significance of Jesus' life, death, and resurrection.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Jesus Christ/The Life of Jesus/Timeline"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Unveiling the Mystery of Jesus' Preexistence: A Christian Revelation</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/pre-existence-jesus/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-09-07T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-09-07T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-09-07:/pre-existence-jesus/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Pre-Existence of Jesus&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pre-existence of Jesus refers to the belief that before he became a man and walked upon the earth, he already existed as the second person of the triune God. This doctrine is explicitly taught in the Bible and can be seen through various passages in the Gospels and Epistles. Jesus himself affirmed his own pre-existence, and his actions further revealed his divine identity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Jesus' Explicit Teaching&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus explicitly taught his pre-existence on multiple occasions. In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/17/John-17-5.html"&gt;John 17:5&lt;/a&gt;, Jesus said, "And now, Father, glorify me in your presence with the glory I had with you before the world began." This statement clearly indicates that Jesus existed in glory with the Father before the creation of the world. Additionally, in several other verses such as &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/3/John-3-13.html"&gt;John 3:13&lt;/a&gt;; 6:33, 38, 62; 8:23; and 16:28, Jesus directly asserts his pre-existence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Father-Son Relationship&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several passages in the New Testament present Jesus as pre-existing with his Father. &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/8/Romans-8-3.html"&gt;Romans 8:3&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-John/1/1-John-1-2.html"&gt;1 John 1:2&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Galatians/4/Galatians-4-4.html"&gt;Galatians 4:4&lt;/a&gt; all highlight this aspect of Jesus' pre-existence. Furthermore, there are texts that identify Jesus as the Creator, such as &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/1/John-1-2.html"&gt;John 1:2&lt;/a&gt;–3, &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Colossians/1/Colossians-1-16.html"&gt;Colossians 1:16&lt;/a&gt;–17, and &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/1/Hebrews-1-2.html"&gt;Hebrews 1:2&lt;/a&gt;. These verses emphasize that Jesus was not just a created being but actively involved in the act of creation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Evidence from Jesus' Actions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most compelling pieces of evidence for the pre-existence of Christ is found in his actions. Jesus often performed acts that only God had the authority or power to do. For example, in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/2/Mark-2-3.html"&gt;Mark 2:3&lt;/a&gt;–12, Jesus healed a paralytic to demonstrate his authority and ability to forgive sins. This action was reserved only for Yahweh, and Jesus' Jewish audience would have recognized this. Similarly, in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/7/Luke-7-48.html"&gt;Luke 7:48&lt;/a&gt;–50, Jesus' actions drew a similar reaction. These instances point to Jesus' divine identity and therefore his pre-existence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Worship and Authority&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus was the object of worship in the Gospels, and he never rejected such adoration. Verses like &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/28/Matthew-28-9.html"&gt;Matthew 28:9&lt;/a&gt;, 17; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/24/Luke-24-52.html"&gt;Luke 24:52&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/9/John-9-38.html"&gt;John 9:38&lt;/a&gt;; and 20:28 show people worshiping Jesus without him rebuking them. This acceptance of worship implies his divinity. Additionally, Jesus claimed authority over the Sabbath (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/2/Mark-2-28.html"&gt;Mark 2:28&lt;/a&gt;) and even the authority to abolish the Law (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Ephesians/2/Ephesians-2-14.html"&gt;Ephesians 2:14&lt;/a&gt;–15). Such claims would be blasphemous if made by anyone other than a divine and pre-existent person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3p7Um5RK97Y" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The Son of Man&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus identified himself as the divine Son of Man in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/14/Mark-14-61.html"&gt;Mark 14:61&lt;/a&gt;–64. This title reflects his unique position as both fully human and fully divine. Jesus also claimed to have the power to raise himself from the dead in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/10/John-10-17.html"&gt;John 10:17&lt;/a&gt;–18. This resurrection became the ultimate proof of his claims and ministry, demonstrating his divine authority and thus confirming his pre-existence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the pre-existence of Jesus is crucial for establishing his divine nature and authority. It confirms that Jesus is not merely a human prophet or teacher but the eternal Son of God who existed before time began. This belief is foundational to Christian theology and shapes our understanding of salvation through Jesus' sacrificial death and resurrection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider the implications of Jesus' pre-existence for your faith. How does knowing that Jesus existed before creation affect your understanding of his teachings and actions? Reflect on how this truth deepens your appreciation for Jesus' sacrifice on the cross and the significance of his resurrection. Embrace the reality that Jesus is not just a historical figure but the eternal Son of God who offers salvation and hope to all who believe in him.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Jesus Christ/The Life of Jesus/Timeline"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Unveiling Jesus: The Thirty-Year Journey to Ministry Unleashed</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/jesus-thirty-years-start-ministry/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-09-05T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-09-05T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-09-05:/jesus-thirty-years-start-ministry/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Jesus' Thirty Years Before Starting His Ministry&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bible tells us that Jesus began His ministry when He was about thirty years old (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/3/Luke-3-23.html"&gt;Luke 3:23&lt;/a&gt;).

By …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Jesus' Thirty Years Before Starting His Ministry&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bible tells us that Jesus began His ministry when He was about thirty years old (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/3/Luke-3-23.html"&gt;Luke 3:23&lt;/a&gt;). This article aims to explore the significance of this age and why Jesus waited until this time to start His public ministry. By examining the cultural context and biblical references, we can gain a deeper understanding of God's timing and purpose in Jesus' life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Age of Maturity&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Jewish culture, the age of thirty was considered a significant milestone for maturity, both physically and mentally. For example, King David became king at the age of thirty (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/2-Samuel/5/2-Samuel-5-4.html"&gt;2 Samuel 5:4&lt;/a&gt;), Joseph entered Pharaoh's service at thirty (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/41/Genesis-41-46.html"&gt;Genesis 41:46&lt;/a&gt;), and Levites began their priestly service at this age (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Numbers/4/Numbers-4-3.html"&gt;Numbers 4:3&lt;/a&gt;, 23, 30, 35). It was a time when individuals were deemed ready for high degrees of responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;A Jewish Rabbi's Ministry&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus, being the Jewish Messiah and a descendant of King David, needed to fulfill certain expectations to be recognized as an authentic rabbi. Thirty was also the age at which Jewish scribes and rabbis were considered mature enough to enter their office as teachers. This practical explanation suggests that Jesus waited until He reached the age of thirty to ensure that His authority as a respected Jewish teacher would not be disregarded by both the common people and religious leaders of His day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nKIeZoOqkV4" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;God's Timing and Purpose&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the cultural significance of the age of thirty provides a practical explanation for Jesus' delayed ministry start, we must also remember that everything Jesus did was in obedience to His Father's will and plan. It was God's timing and purpose that determined when Jesus would begin His public ministry. The pivotal moment in all of history was primed to unfold, and Jesus had reached the culturally acceptable age of maturity and development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the significance of Jesus' age when He began His ministry helps us appreciate God's intentional timing and plan for His life. It demonstrates the meticulous attention to detail in fulfilling prophecies and cultural expectations surrounding the Messiah. It also highlights the importance of maturity and readiness for the responsibilities that come with serving God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does knowing Jesus' age when He began His ministry impact your understanding of His identity as the Messiah?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consider the significance of age milestones in your own life. How can you embrace maturity and readiness for the responsibilities God has entrusted to you?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reflect on God's timing and purpose in your own life. How can you trust Him even when things don't happen according to your desired timeline?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By delving into the cultural context and biblical references, we can better grasp the reasons behind Jesus waiting until He was thirty years old to start His ministry. This understanding deepens our appreciation for God's perfect timing and purpose in Jesus' life. May we learn from His example and trust in God's timing for our own journeys of faith.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Jesus Christ/The Life of Jesus/Timeline"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>When Did Jesus Die: Revealing the Crucial Year</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/what-year-did-jesus-die/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-08-18T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-08-18T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-08-18:/what-year-did-jesus-die/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;What Year Did Jesus Die?&lt;/h2&gt;

Through His death, God bridged the gap between Himself and humanity, offering reconciliation and redemption from sin. While the Bible does not provide an exact date for Jesus' death, we can arrive …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;What Year Did Jesus Die?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The death and resurrection of Jesus Christ are pivotal events in human history. Through His death, God bridged the gap between Himself and humanity, offering reconciliation and redemption from sin. While the Bible does not provide an exact date for Jesus' death, we can arrive at a fairly accurate estimate based on historical clues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1. Birth and Death Timeline&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although our world timeline is divided into BC (before Christ) and AD (anno Domini, meaning "in the year of our Lord"), Jesus was actually born between 6 and 4 BC. This conclusion is drawn from the death of Herod the Great, who ruled Judaea from 47 BC until his demise in 4 BC. After Herod's death, Joseph, Mary, and the infant Jesus were instructed to return to Israel from Egypt (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/2/Matthew-2-19.html"&gt;Matthew 2:19&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2. John the Baptist's Ministry&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To determine the year of Jesus' death, we can look at the starting point of John the Baptist's ministry. &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/3/Luke-3-1.html"&gt;Luke 3:1&lt;/a&gt; mentions that John began preaching in the fifteenth year of Tiberius's reign. Tiberius became emperor in AD 14. Assuming that Jesus was baptized and began His ministry around AD 29, and ministered for approximately three and a half years, we can deduce that Jesus' ministry ended in AD 33.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;3. Pontius Pilate's Rule&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pontius Pilate served as the Roman governor of Judea from AD 26 to 36. The crucifixion of Jesus took place during Passover (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/14/Mark-14-12.html"&gt;Mark 14:12&lt;/a&gt;). Considering this fact along with the timeline of John the Baptist's ministry, we can narrow down the date of Jesus' crucifixion to Friday, April 3, AD 33.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the approximate year of Jesus' death helps us contextualize and appreciate the events surrounding His crucifixion and resurrection. It allows us to connect with the historical reality of Jesus' sacrifice, making it more tangible and relatable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;4. Alternative Date&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is an argument for an earlier date, April 7, AD 30, based on an earlier start to John the Baptist's ministry and an assumed co-regency of Tiberius and Augustus. However, the later date, AD 33, aligns better with the historical record and the information available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PRVuDJvTLAM" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the exact year of Jesus' death is not explicitly stated in the Bible, its approximate estimation aligns with historical evidence and supports the narrative of Jesus' life, ministry, and ultimate sacrifice. This historical accuracy underscores the reliability of the biblical accounts and reinforces our faith in Jesus as our Savior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;5. Significance of AD 33&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The death and resurrection of Jesus Christ in AD 33 mark a momentous turning point in human history. These events carry immense significance for Christians worldwide. Through His death, Jesus took upon Himself the sins of humanity, providing a way for reconciliation with God. His resurrection offers new birth into a living hope (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-Peter/1/1-Peter-1-3.html"&gt;1 Peter 1:3&lt;/a&gt;), demonstrating His victory over sin and death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;6. The Savior of the World&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the time of Christ, many significant events have occurred on the world stage. However, none can surpass the magnitude and meaning of what transpired in AD 33—the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ, who is hailed as the Savior of the world. This pivotal event forms the foundation of Christianity, offering salvation to all who place their faith in Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the historical context and significance of Jesus' death and resurrection helps us grasp the immeasurable love and grace God demonstrated through His Son. It reminds us of the depth of our need for salvation and encourages us to place our trust in Jesus Christ as our Savior and Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The death and resurrection of Jesus Christ are not merely historical events; they have profound implications for our lives today. They offer us forgiveness, reconciliation with God, and the hope of eternal life. As believers, we are called to embrace these truths, share the good news with others, and live in the light of Christ's victory over sin and death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, while the Bible does not provide an exact date for Jesus' death, historical evidence allows us to estimate it with a fair degree of accuracy. The death and resurrection of Jesus Christ hold immense significance for Christians, providing the means for reconciliation with God and offering hope for eternal life. Understanding the historical context and significance of these events deepens our faith and prompts us to live in light of Jesus' victory over sin and death.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Jesus Christ/The Life of Jesus/Timeline"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Did God Create Jesus?

&lt;p&gt;The question of whether God created Jesus is an important aspect of Christian theology. According to the Bible and ancient Christian creeds, Jesus is not a created being but rather the eternal Son of God. Let's explore this concept in more detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Eternal Son&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Did God Create Jesus?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question of whether God created Jesus is an important aspect of Christian theology. According to the Bible and ancient Christian creeds, Jesus is not a created being but rather the eternal Son of God. Let's explore this concept in more detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Eternal Son&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bible teaches that Jesus is the eternal Son of God. He has always existed and there was never a time when He did not exist. This is supported by passages such as &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/1/John-1-1.html"&gt;John 1:1&lt;/a&gt;–3, which states, "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was in the beginning with God. All things were made through him, and without him was not any thing made that was made." The "Word" in this verse refers to the Son of God before He took on human flesh and came to earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Nature of Jesus&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before Jesus came to earth, He already existed in the form of God as a member of the triune Godhead. &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Colossians/2/Colossians-2-9.html"&gt;Colossians 2:9&lt;/a&gt; affirms this, stating, "In Christ all the fullness of the Deity lives in bodily form." Jesus is fully God and has always been so. Therefore, He was not created because God Himself was not created.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Incarnation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/j0Z9kOi5Y2U" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Jesus came to earth, He took on human nature and a human body. This event is known as the Incarnation. &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Philippians/2/Philippians-2-6.html"&gt;Philippians 2:6&lt;/a&gt;–8 describes what took place when Jesus came to earth: "Being in very nature God, [He] did not consider equality with God something to be used to His own advantage; rather, He made Himself nothing by taking the very nature of a servant, being made in human likeness. And being found in appearance as a man, He humbled Himself by becoming obedient to death—even death on a cross!"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the Incarnation, the eternal Son of God took on human flesh but did not cease to be God. His divine nature remained intact while He humbled Himself and became fully human. Jesus' body was "prepared" for Him in order to offer the perfect sacrifice for sin (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/10/Hebrews-10-5.html"&gt;Hebrews 10:5&lt;/a&gt;). The Holy Spirit overshadowed a virgin, and she conceived. This miraculous event is described in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/1/Luke-1-26.html"&gt;Luke 1:26&lt;/a&gt;–38.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Fully God and Fully Man&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus' dual nature as fully God and fully man is a crucial aspect of Christian belief. He had to be fully human in order to bear the penalty for our sins (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/2-Corinthians/5/2-Corinthians-5-21.html"&gt;2 Corinthians 5:21&lt;/a&gt;). Jesus lived a sinless life, completely in harmony with His heavenly Father and in dependence upon the Holy Spirit. No created being could have borne the weight of the world's sins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sacrificial animals used before Christ were mere symbols of the ultimate sacrifice that Jesus would make as the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/1/John-1-29.html"&gt;John 1:29&lt;/a&gt;). Only God Himself could meet the requirements for an acceptable substitute, and Jesus is God. Through faith in Him, we are guaranteed eternal life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding that Jesus is not a created being but the eternal Son of God has significant implications for our faith. It reinforces the divinity and authority of Jesus as our Savior and Lord. It also highlights the incredible love and humility that Jesus demonstrated by willingly taking on human flesh and sacrificing Himself for our sins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reflecting on the eternal nature of Jesus can deepen our appreciation for His sacrifice and help us trust Him more fully. Consider how knowing that Jesus is both fully God and fully man impacts your understanding of His work on the cross. How does this knowledge shape your relationship with Him?&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Jesus Christ/The Life of Jesus/Timeline"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Unlocking the Fullness of Time: Embracing God's Perfect Plan</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/fullness-of-time/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-08-03T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-08-03T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-08-03:/fullness-of-time/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;The Fullness of Time: God's Perfect Timing for Sending His Son&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bible tells us that "when the time had fully come, God sent his Son, born of a woman, born under law" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Galatians/4/Galatians-4-4.html"&gt;Galatians 4:4&lt;/a&gt;). This verse highlights the fact that God chose a specific moment in history to …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;The Fullness of Time: God's Perfect Timing for Sending His Son&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bible tells us that "when the time had fully come, God sent his Son, born of a woman, born under law" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Galatians/4/Galatians-4-4.html"&gt;Galatians 4:4&lt;/a&gt;). This verse highlights the fact that God chose a specific moment in history to send His Son, Jesus Christ, into the world. In this article, we will explore why that particular time was significant and how it aligned with God's plan for salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Anticipation of the Messiah&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the first century, there was a great anticipation among the Jewish people for the coming of the Messiah. This expectation was fueled by the Roman rule over Israel, which made them long for deliverance. The Jews were yearning for their promised Messiah to rescue them from oppression and establish His kingdom. The timing of Jesus' birth fulfilled this expectation and brought hope to a people in desperate need of salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Unity and Ease of Travel&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another factor that contributed to the perfect timing of Jesus' arrival was the unity brought about by Roman rule. Under Roman governance, much of the known world was unified, creating an environment conducive to travel and communication. This allowed the early Christians to spread the gospel more easily and extensively than would have been possible in previous eras. The relative peace maintained by Rome also made travel safer and facilitated the movement of missionaries throughout various regions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Common Language and Cultural Influences&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to political unity, there was a common trade language spoken throughout the Roman Empire. This simplified communication and made it possible for the gospel message to spread across different people groups. The prevalence of Greek as a lingua franca allowed for effective evangelism among diverse cultures. Furthermore, Greek culture had permeated much of society during that time. The influence of Greek philosophy and science left many spiritually empty, creating fertile ground for the message of Christ's redemptive work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Rejection of False Idols&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Yu7hHNjdtAg" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The failure of false idols to grant victory over the Roman conquerors led many to question and abandon their worship. In culturally sophisticated cities, the inadequacy of Greek philosophy and science left people spiritually void. This spiritual hunger, combined with the emptiness left by failed idolatry, made the gospel of Christ more compelling. The message of one ultimate sacrifice resonated with those who had witnessed the bloodshed required by the mystery religions prevalent at the time. Additionally, the Greeks' belief in the immortality of the soul, although not of the body, provided a framework for understanding the promise of eternal life through faith in Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Preparation Through Jewish Law&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God's plan for salvation involved preparing people for the coming of the Messiah through the Jewish Law. The Law served multiple purposes, including revealing the depth of human sinfulness and demonstrating humanity's inability to fulfill its requirements. By highlighting their need for a Savior, the Law paved the way for people to accept Jesus as the Messiah and embrace His redemptive work on their behalf. The sacrificial system within the Law pointed to the need for a perfect sacrifice for sin, which Jesus ultimately fulfilled through His death on the cross.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Fulfillment of Prophecy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The timing of Jesus' incarnation also aligns with specific prophecies recorded in Scripture. One such prophecy is found in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Daniel/9/Daniel-9-24.html"&gt;Daniel 9:24-27&lt;/a&gt;, which speaks of seventy weeks or seventy "sevens." These sevens represent groups of seven years and relate to a period leading up to the arrival of the Anointed One (Messiah). The countdown of these seventy weeks begins with "the going forth of the command to restore and build Jerusalem." The precise fulfillment of this prophecy points to Jesus as the promised Messiah and affirms God's perfect timing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Understanding why Jesus came at a specific point in history helps us grasp God's sovereignty and His intricate plan for salvation. It strengthens our faith as we see how God orchestrated events to fulfill prophecies and prepare the world for the coming of His Son. Recognizing that Jesus' arrival was not a random occurrence but rather part of God's divine timing deepens our appreciation for the significance of His sacrifice and the magnitude of His love for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; The timing of Jesus' birth not only fulfilled prophecy but also aligned with historical and cultural factors that made it an opportune moment for the spread of the gospel. Consider how God's perfect timing in sending Jesus impacts your understanding of His plan for your life. How does this knowledge shape your perspective on current circumstances and the timing of God's work in your own life?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, the fullness of time refers to God's perfect timing in sending Jesus into the world. The anticipation of the Messiah, political unity, ease of travel, common language, rejection of false idols, preparation through the Jewish Law, and fulfillment of prophecy all played a part in making that particular time ideal for Christ's arrival. Understanding this helps us appreciate God's sovereignty and purpose in orchestrating events throughout history. As we reflect on God's perfect timing, may it deepen our faith and inspire us to trust in His plans for our lives.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Jesus Christ/The Life of Jesus/Timeline"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>How Old Was Jesus When He Died: Revealing the Truth Behind His Final Years</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/how-old-was-jesus-when-he-died/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-07-12T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-07-12T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-07-12:/how-old-was-jesus-when-he-died/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;How Old was Jesus When He Died?&lt;/h2&gt;

However, by examining the historical context and events mentioned in the New Testament, we can …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;How Old was Jesus When He Died?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The age of Jesus when He died is not explicitly mentioned in the Bible, making it impossible to determine His precise age at the time of His death. However, by examining the historical context and events mentioned in the New Testament, we can make an estimation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Estimating Jesus' Birth Year&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To determine the age of Jesus when He died, we need to establish a starting point for His life. The Bible does not provide the exact date of Jesus' birth, but by examining various historical sources and comparing them with the Gospel of Luke, we can deduce that Jesus was born between 6 and 4 BC, around the time of King Herod's death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Key Milestones in Jesus' Childhood According to the Bible&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the early life of Jesus through biblical accounts highlights several important events:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Circumcision at Eight Days (Luke 2:21):&lt;/strong&gt; This is a significant Jewish tradition as outlined by Mosaic Law, marking the covenant with God established through Abraham. It's not only a physical mark of this covenant but also serves as the initial step of integrating a male child into the Jewish faith community. Jesus underwent circumcision at just eight days old. This practice was in accordance with the traditions outlined in the Mosaic Law and signified a pivotal ritual for Jewish male infants. Circumcision served as a symbolic introduction into the Jewish faith community and marked the physical sign of God's covenant with Abraham. This ritual was essential for the inclusion of a male child into the spiritual and communal life of Judaism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Presentation at the Temple (Luke 2:22):&lt;/strong&gt; Taking place 40 days post-birth, this event involved a purification ritual for both mother and child. It had dual significance: the ceremonial cleansing after childbirth and the redemption of the firstborn male, which involved making a sacrificial offering to symbolize that Jesus, like all firstborn males, was inherently dedicated to God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teaching in the Temple at Twelve (Luke 2:41-51):&lt;/strong&gt; This milestone occurred a year before Jesus would have been of age for a Bar-Mitzvah. In a remarkable display of wisdom, young Jesus engaged with the respected teachers of the temple, showcasing an understanding far beyond his years and those expected from a child still under his parents' moral guidance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Visit from the Magi at Approximately Two Years Old (Matthew 2:16):&lt;/strong&gt; This notable visit placed Jesus at about two years of age, inferred from King Herod's orders following the Magi's departure. This timeline reflects Herod’s intense desire to safeguard his throne by eliminating potential threats, which tragically led to the massacre of young boys around Bethlehem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each event encapsulates a blend of religious tradition and prophetic significance, painting a picture of Jesus' early life as both conventional in its adherence to Jewish customs and extraordinary in its divine implications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How Old Was Jesus When the Magi Visited?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The visit of the Magi, as described in the Gospel of Matthew, offers insights into the timeline of Jesus' early life. When King Herod learned of the Magi's journey to find the newborn king, he calculated the timing based on their departure. Concerned about the prophecy, Herod ordered the death of all male children in Bethlehem who were two years old or younger. This action gives us a strong indication that Jesus was approximately two years old when the Magi arrived to see him. Thus, the Magi's visit occurred not at the time of his birth, but rather during his toddler years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Start of Jesus' Ministry&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, we need to identify the date when Jesus began His public ministry. According to &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/3/Luke-3-1.html"&gt;Luke 3:1&lt;/a&gt;, John the Baptist started preaching in the fifteenth year of Tiberius's reign, which would be around AD 28 or 29. It is likely that Jesus was baptized and began His ministry around this time when He was approximately 30 years old.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Scriptural and Historical Context&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Age and Ministry:&lt;/strong&gt; Luke 3:23 confirms that Jesus was about 30 years old when He began his ministry. This age aligns with Jewish customs, as Numbers 4:3 sets 30 as the age for entering the priesthood, marking it as a significant milestone in a man's life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ancestral Lineage:&lt;/strong&gt; Jesus' ability to teach in the Temple is supported by his lineage. Luke 1:5 reveals that Mary, his mother, was related to Elizabeth, a descendant of Aaron. This connection provided Jesus with the necessary credentials to fulfill his teaching role, rooted in both royal and priestly heritage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Key Events at the Start of His Ministry&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Baptism:&lt;/strong&gt; Jesus' ministry commenced with his baptism, a pivotal event marking his public dedication to his mission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Temptation:&lt;/strong&gt; Following his baptism, Jesus was led into the wilderness, where he faced and overcame temptation (Luke 4:1-12), demonstrating his spiritual readiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teaching and Preaching:&lt;/strong&gt; He began practicing and teaching in synagogues, notably in Nazareth, where his teachings started to gain attention (Luke 4:14-22).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Significance of Age and Ministry Duration&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding that Jesus began his ministry at 30 and ministered for approximately three years until his crucifixion at 33 provides a framework for the timeline of his impactful mission. This age marks the convergence of his royal and priestly lineages, which played a crucial role in the spiritual and political dynamics of his ministry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Unraveling Jesus' Early Life: The Young Adult Years&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The years between Jesus' adolescence and adulthood are largely undocumented in the scriptures. However, there are clues scattered throughout the Bible and historical context that provide insight into this mysterious period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The Carpenter's Craft&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the Gospel of Mark (6:3), where Jesus is referred to as &amp;quot;the carpenter,&amp;quot; we glean that he likely followed in his father Joseph's footsteps. Joseph's trade was carpentry, a skill typically passed from father to son. This vocational training would have been expected in their culture, suggesting Jesus spent these years working in carpentry and possibly carrying on the family business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Proximity to Major Construction&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During Jesus' youth, the Herodian kings were busy with large-scale construction projects in the region. Given his carpentry skills, it's plausible that Jesus participated in these projects. Such endeavors required considerable manpower, and Jesus’ involvement would align with his known profession.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The Essene Hypothesis&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some scholars propose a connection between Jesus and the Essene community—a Jewish sect with particular focus on end times and communal life. While the Bible doesn't explicitly mention Essenes, similarities in teachings have fueled this theory. Both opposed Pharisees, Sadducees, and Roman authorities, and the Essenes were noted for their celibacy, which corresponds with Jesus' unmarried status.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Luke 22:7-13, Jesus instructs his disciples to follow a man carrying water, an unusual sight since this task typically fell to women unless no females were present or servants were unavailable. The Essenes, often residing in gender-segregated communities, required men to perform such duties themselves, adding weight to the speculation of a shared connection.
Additionally, Jesus' directive to find a place for Passover by speaking to the &amp;quot;Teacher&amp;quot; mirrors the Essene title &amp;quot;Teacher of Righteousness.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though we can't definitively assert that Jesus was part of the Essene sect, it's evident that he was familiar with their Jerusalem branch and shared some ideological resonances.
These elements together offer a glimpse into Jesus' life as a young adult, merging cultural expectations with intriguing historical possibilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What Cultural or Ancestral Credentials Did Jesus Have for Teaching in the Temple?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To teach in the Temple, Jesus needed specific cultural and ancestral qualifications. According to the Gospel of Luke, Jesus began his ministry at around the age of thirty, a pivotal age in Jewish tradition for entering religious duty (Luke 3:23). The age of thirty is significant, as outlined in Numbers 4:3, which sets this age as the starting point for full ministerial responsibilities within the Jewish priesthood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, Jesus possessed an ancestral pedigree that afforded him the authority to teach. His mother, Mary, had familial ties to the priestly line through her cousin Elizabeth. Elizabeth is identified in Luke 1:5 as a descendant of Aaron, the first high priest of Israel. This connection links Jesus to the Aaronic line, thereby granting him the necessary ancestral credentials for his role in the Temple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This combination of reaching the traditional age of ministry and having a lineage linked to Aaron provided Jesus with both the cultural and ancestral legitimacy needed to engage in teaching and other religious activities at the Temple in Jerusalem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;How old was Jesus when he taught at the Temple?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Jesus taught in the Temple, he was 12 years old. This momentous event occurred just a year before he would reach the age of Bar-Mitzvah, when a Jewish boy becomes accountable for his own actions under religious law. Despite still being considered a child and his father being responsible for him, Jesus demonstrated remarkable wisdom by engaging with and instructing the teachers at the Temple. His insights surpassed those of even the most knowledgeable scholars of the time, highlighting his extraordinary understanding and insight at such a young age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;What was Jesus occupation before beginning his ministry?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the Bible doesn't provide detailed accounts of Jesus' life between the ages of twelve and the start of his ministry, there are clues about his occupation during this period. Mark 6:3 references Jesus as "the carpenter," based on the observations of people who watched him grow up. This suggests that Jesus learned and practiced carpentry before his ministry began.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, it is widely understood that his earthly father, Joseph, was also a carpenter. It was customary at the time for sons to learn their father's trade, implying that Jesus would have been involved in the carpentry business, likely assisting and eventually carrying on the family trade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How does the Law Of Moses relate to Jesus' life milestones?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To understand how the Law of Moses relates to Jesus' life milestones, it's essential to regard Jesus as a figure who adhered to these laws impeccably, as part of his Jewish upbringing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Adherence to Jewish Laws&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Circumcision&lt;/strong&gt;: According to the Mosaic Law, all male children were to be circumcised on the eighth day. This rite was more than a physical act; it was a crucial marker of God’s covenant with Abraham and a gateway for the child into Jewish religious life (Luke 2:21).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ritual Purification&lt;/strong&gt;: Around forty days after birth, the Law required a visit to the Temple for purification. This dual-purpose ceremony involved declaring the child clean after birth-related events, and importantly, redeeming the firstborn male, which Jesus was, by offering a sacrifice (Luke 2:22).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Early Display of Wisdom&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At twelve years old, Jesus was found teaching at the Temple (Luke 2:41-51). This pre-dated his Bar Mitzvah by a year—a significant Jewish milestone marking the occasion when a boy becomes responsible for his own actions according to Jewish law. Despite being considered a child, Jesus demonstrated wisdom that surpassed the most knowledgeable teachers, indicating an early mastery of the Law that governed his community life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By examining these rituals and events, one can trace how the Law of Moses framed key moments in Jesus' early life, highlighting his role as a figure who fulfilled these laws both perfectly and profoundly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Significance of the Temple Presentation for Jesus&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Temple presentation held profound significance for Jesus, marking a pivotal event in his early life. This ceremony took place 40 days after his birth, aligning with Jewish customs for purification and redemption.
Purification Ritual&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One primary purpose of this event was the purification ritual. After childbirth, Jewish law required a ceremony to declare both the mother and the child clean. For Mary, it symbolized her return to a state of ritual cleanliness following childbirth. The process also cleansed Jesus from any ritual impurity acquired through association with his mother's blood during birth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Redemption of the Firstborn&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the presentation was significant because Jesus was a firstborn male. In Jewish tradition, all firstborn sons were consecrated to God. As a result, parents were obligated to redeem their firstborn through a sacrificial offering. This act not only signified Jesus' dedication to God but also underscored the family's adherence to Jewish law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary, the Temple presentation was a multifaceted ceremony that confirmed Jesus' place within Jewish tradition while foreshadowing his unique role in religious history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Duration of Jesus' Ministry&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By considering the number of Passover feasts mentioned in Scripture and assuming each feast corresponds to one year of Jesus' ministry, we can estimate that He ministered for approximately three and a half years. Based on this calculation, we can conclude that Jesus' ministry ended around AD 33.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Calculating Jesus' Age at Death&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QNfHAAG5Ud0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taking into account the estimated birth year of Jesus (between 6 and 4 BC) and the duration of His ministry (approximately three and a half years), we can calculate an approximate age range for Him at the time of His death. If we subtract four years from AD 1 (the transition from BC to AD) to account for His birth between 6 and 4 BC, and then add 33 years for the duration of His ministry, we arrive at a total of 37 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Age Range of Jesus at Death&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on this calculation, we can say that Jesus was in His thirties when He was crucified. However, due to the uncertainty surrounding His exact birth date and the year He began His public ministry, the age range could be between 33 and 39 years old.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Understanding Jesus’ Age at Death in Context&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To truly appreciate how Jesus' age at death compares to the average lifespan of his era, we must dive into historical life expectancy data. While it's commonly cited that the average lifespan during Jesus' time was approximately 35 years, this statistic is heavily skewed by high infant mortality rates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Adjusted Life Expectancy&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we focus solely on individuals who survived past early childhood, reaching the age of five, the average life expectancy increases to around 56 years, with a variation of approximately 15.5 years, according to research published in the Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine by JP Griffin. This means that those who reached adulthood often lived significantly longer than the 35-year average suggests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Comparing Jesus' Age&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus is believed to have died in his early thirties, which, when considered against the adjusted life expectancy of the time, indicates he died relatively young. Many individuals in his society lived well into their forties, fifties, and beyond, had they survived those vulnerable first years of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary, Jesus’ death at such a young age, particularly in the context of his potential lifespan based on contemporary standards, underscores a life devoted to purpose rather than longevity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding Jesus' approximate age helps us better grasp the depth of His sacrifice and the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies. It reminds us that Jesus willingly laid down His life at a relatively young age to redeem humanity from sin and offer eternal salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To truly appreciate this act, it's essential to recognize the profound nature of His choice. Jesus' decision to die was not merely a fulfillment of prophecies but a deliberate act of love and commitment to His mission. Despite having the ability to live a longer life, He chose to sacrifice Himself once His divine objectives were fulfilled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This act was not the result of coercion; rather, it was a conscious decision, reflecting His unwavering dedication to humanity's redemption. The nature of His death—gruesome and violent—further underscores the extent of His sacrifice. Such a death was a testament to the profound price He was willing to pay, highlighting the gravity and depth of His mission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By choosing to die in such a manner, Jesus demonstrated how to live a life of purpose, how to face death with resolve, and ultimately, how to embrace eternal life. His life and death serve as a model, offering insights into living with intention and achieving spiritual fulfillment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Think About It&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reflecting on Jesus' age at death can lead us to contemplate the brevity of life and the urgency of accepting His gift of salvation. It prompts us to consider the immense love and sacrifice Jesus demonstrated by willingly submitting Himself to crucifixion at a relatively young age. His death was not only a fulfillment of divine prophecy but also a testament to His commitment to humanity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nature of His death was gruesome and violent, further emphasizing the cost of our redemption. By willingly enduring such suffering, Jesus provided a vivid example of ultimate sacrifice and love. This understanding deepens our appreciation for His mission and motivates us to live faithfully in response to His sacrifice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, Jesus' life was long enough to show us how to live, how to die, and how to live again eternally. This reflection encourages us to consider our own lives' purpose and align them with the divine will, inspired by the example Jesus set for believers today.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Jesus Christ/The Life of Jesus/Timeline"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Unveiling the Length of Jesus' Impactful Ministry: A Revealing Exploration</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/length-jesus-ministry/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-07-10T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-07-10T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-07-10:/length-jesus-ministry/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Length of Jesus' Ministry&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

While the Bible does not explicitly state how long Jesus' ministry lasted, we can gather some information from the New Testament to estimate its duration. By examining the events …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Length of Jesus' Ministry&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The length of Jesus' ministry is a topic that has been debated among scholars and theologians. While the Bible does not explicitly state how long Jesus' ministry lasted, we can gather some information from the New Testament to estimate its duration. By examining the events and timelines provided in the Gospels, we can gain a better understanding of the length of Jesus' earthly ministry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Beginning of Jesus' Ministry&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/3/Luke-3-1.html"&gt;Luke 3:1&lt;/a&gt;, John the Baptist began his ministry in the fifteenth year of Tiberius Caesar's reign. Since Tiberius became emperor in AD 14, the fifteenth year would be around AD 28 or 29. Shortly after John's ministry began, Jesus began his own ministry. Therefore, we can estimate that Jesus' ministry started around AD 29.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Passovers and Jesus' Ministry&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Gospel of John mentions at least three annual Feasts of Passover that Jesus attended during his ministry. In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/2/John-2-13.html"&gt;John 2:13&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/6/John-6-4.html"&gt;John 6:4&lt;/a&gt;, and 11:55-57, Passovers are mentioned. Based on this information alone, we can conclude that Jesus' ministry lasted at least two years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, many scholars believe that there was another Passover that is not mentioned in the Gospels, falling between the Passovers in John 2 and John 6. If this is the case, then Jesus' ministry would have extended to at least three years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Events before the First Passover&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before Jesus attended the first Passover mentioned in John's Gospel (in the spring of AD 30), he had already accomplished many things. He had traveled from the area of the Jordan to Cana to Capernaum to Jerusalem. He was baptized by John (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/3/Matthew-3-13.html"&gt;Matthew 3:13-17&lt;/a&gt;), tempted in the wilderness (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/4/Matthew-4-1.html"&gt;Matthew 4:1-2&lt;/a&gt;), began his preaching ministry (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/4/Matthew-4-17.html"&gt;Matthew 4:17&lt;/a&gt;), called his first disciples (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/1/John-1-35.html"&gt;John 1:35-51&lt;/a&gt;), performed his first miracle (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/2/John-2-1.html"&gt;John 2:1-11&lt;/a&gt;), and made a trip to Capernaum with his family (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/2/John-2-12.html"&gt;John 2:12&lt;/a&gt;). All these events would have taken several months, at least.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The End of Jesus' Ministry&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The culmination of Jesus' ministry was marked by his crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension. Following his resurrection, Jesus spent 40 days on earth before ascending to heaven (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Acts/1/Acts-1-3.html"&gt;Acts 1:3&lt;/a&gt;). Taking this into account, we can estimate that Jesus' earthly ministry lasted approximately three and a half years, from his baptism to his ascension.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AYvb9AvQ2l0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Understanding the length of Jesus' ministry is important for several reasons. Firstly, it helps us establish a timeline of the major events in Jesus' life and ministry. This allows us to gain a deeper appreciation for the significance of these events and how they fit into God's plan of redemption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, knowing the duration of Jesus' ministry helps us understand the intensity of his teaching and the impact he had on those who encountered him. In a relatively short period of time, Jesus preached profound truths, performed miracles, and transformed the lives of countless individuals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, recognizing the length of Jesus' ministry helps us appreciate the sacrifice he made for humanity. In just a few years, Jesus accomplished what no other person could ever achieve - redeeming humanity through his death and resurrection. Understanding the brevity of his earthly ministry underscores the magnitude of his love and sacrifice for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider the impact Jesus had on the world during his relatively short ministry. How does this inspire you to live out your faith in a meaningful way? How can you make the most of the time you have been given to share God's love with others?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there is no definitive answer to the exact length of Jesus' ministry, we can estimate that it lasted approximately three and a half years. By examining the events and timelines provided in the New Testament, we can piece together a timeline of Jesus' earthly ministry. Understanding the duration of Jesus' ministry helps us appreciate the significance of his teachings, miracles, and ultimately, his sacrifice for humanity. May we be inspired by his example to make the most of our time on earth and share God's love with others.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Jesus Christ/The Life of Jesus/Timeline"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Where Did Jesus Live: Exploring the Holy Land's Sacred Sites</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/where-did-jesus-live/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-06-21T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-06-21T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-06-21:/where-did-jesus-live/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Where Did Jesus Live?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus lived in various places throughout his life on earth. His journey began in heaven, where he was with God the Father before coming to earth (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/17/John-17-5.html"&gt;John 17:5&lt;/a&gt;). The Gospel of John also tells us that Jesus, as the Word of God, was with God …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Where Did Jesus Live?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus lived in various places throughout his life on earth. His journey began in heaven, where he was with God the Father before coming to earth (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/17/John-17-5.html"&gt;John 17:5&lt;/a&gt;). The Gospel of John also tells us that Jesus, as the Word of God, was with God in the beginning (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/1/John-1-1.html"&gt;John 1:1-2&lt;/a&gt;,14).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Jesus was born, he came into the world in Bethlehem. The story of his birth is narrated in Luke 2. Although Mary and Joseph were from Nazareth, they traveled to Bethlehem for a census. They could not find a place to stay because they had no immediate family there. Jesus was born in a stable, but later on, the family moved to a house in Bethlehem where they received a visit from the wise men. King Herod learned of their visit and sought to kill Jesus as a potential rival. An angel warned Joseph in a dream, and the family fled to Egypt until Herod's death (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/2/Matthew-2-13.html"&gt;Matthew 2:13-15&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Herod's death, Joseph brought the family back to Nazareth (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/2/Matthew-2-23.html"&gt;Matthew 2:23&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/2/Luke-2-39.html"&gt;Luke 2:39&lt;/a&gt;). Nazareth became Jesus' hometown where he grew up. This is why Jesus is often referred to as "Jesus of Nazareth" in the Bible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nKIeZoOqkV4" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once Jesus began his public ministry, he moved his base of operations to Capernaum, located in Galilee near the shores of the Sea of Galilee (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/4/Matthew-4-13.html"&gt;Matthew 4:13&lt;/a&gt;). From Capernaum, he made several trips to Jerusalem, where many significant events recorded in the Gospels took place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to note that Jesus did not have a permanent home or property of his own during his earthly ministry. In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/9/Luke-9-57.html"&gt;Luke 9:57-58&lt;/a&gt;, Jesus replied to someone who wanted to follow him by saying, "Foxes have dens and birds have nests, but the Son of Man has no place to lay his head." This indicates that Jesus did not have a home of his own and often stayed with friends or camped wherever he was during his itinerant ministry. For example, he was a guest at the home of Mary, Martha, and Lazarus in Bethany (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/10/Luke-10-38.html"&gt;Luke 10:38&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Jesus' resurrection, he ascended back to heaven and is now seated at the right hand of the Father (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Ephesians/1/Ephesians-1-20.html"&gt;Ephesians 1:20&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Colossians/3/Colossians-3-1.html"&gt;Colossians 3:1&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/8/Hebrews-8-1.html"&gt;Hebrews 8:1&lt;/a&gt;). Jesus temporarily made his home on earth to secure a place for us in his Father's house (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/14/John-14-1.html"&gt;John 14:1-4&lt;/a&gt;). In the future, all those who have put their faith in him will enjoy living in his presence, as described in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Revelation/22/Revelation-22-1.html"&gt;Revelation 22:1-5&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding where Jesus lived helps us grasp the significance of his life and ministry. It reinforces the fact that Jesus willingly left his heavenly home to come to earth, living among humanity to reconcile us to God. His birth in Bethlehem fulfilled prophecies and marked the beginning of God's redemptive plan. Jesus' time in Nazareth highlights his humble upbringing and identification with ordinary people. His ministry in Capernaum and visits to Jerusalem demonstrate the impact of his teachings and miracles on both Galilee and Judea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reflecting on where Jesus lived reminds us that he experienced various settings and encountered diverse people throughout his life. This emphasizes his relatability and accessibility to all people, regardless of their background or circumstances. It also challenges us to consider how we can follow Jesus' example by being open and adaptable in our interactions with others, just as he was during his time on earth.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Jesus Christ/The Life of Jesus/Timeline"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Unveiling the Truth: Was Jesus Created or Eternal?</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/was-jesus-created/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-06-05T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-06-05T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-06-05:/was-jesus-created/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Was Jesus Created?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question of whether Jesus was created or not is a significant one within Christian theology. The Bible teaches that Jesus was not created but rather is the Creator Himself. This belief in the eternality of Christ is a distinguishing characteristic of biblical Christianity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Jesus as the …&lt;/h3&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Was Jesus Created?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question of whether Jesus was created or not is a significant one within Christian theology. The Bible teaches that Jesus was not created but rather is the Creator Himself. This belief in the eternality of Christ is a distinguishing characteristic of biblical Christianity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Jesus as the Creator&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the Bible, Jesus is not only the Son of God but also the Creator of all things. The book of Colossians states that "in [Jesus Christ] all things were created: . . . all things have been created through him and for him" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Colossians/1/Colossians-1-16.html"&gt;Colossians 1:16&lt;/a&gt;). This emphasizes that Jesus is not a created being but rather the one responsible for creating everything. This understanding sets orthodox Christianity apart from other religions and philosophies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Different Beliefs about Jesus' Creation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Jesus is highly respected in various religious beliefs such as Islam, Mormonism, and Jehovah’s Witnesses, these groups teach that Jesus was a created being. For example, Muslims view Jesus as a virgin-born human prophet who came into existence just like any other person. Mormons, influenced by Arianism, believe that Jesus had a beginning similar to God the Father. Jehovah’s Witnesses assert that Jesus was the first creation of Jehovah and was originally known as Michael the archangel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What Did Early Creeds Teach?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The early creeds of the church firmly affirm that Jesus was not created but is an eternally divine Person, the Son of God. These creeds provide essential guidance for understanding the nature of Jesus. They clarify whether Jesus belongs to the created order or if He, along with the Father and the Holy Spirit, is the Creator of all things. The Council of Nicea declared that Christ and the Father are "of the same substance," countering Arius' belief that Christ was "of a different substance."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WY-b9fr-8d8" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Jesus' Claim to Divinity&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To understand whether Jesus was created or not, it is crucial to examine His own words. During His ministry, Jesus consistently assumed divine prerogatives and exercised rights that would not be appropriate for a created being. For instance, He declared Himself as the "Lord of the Sabbath," asserting His authority over this institution established by God. Jesus also spoke of His unique knowledge of the Father and the glory He shared with the Father before the world began. Furthermore, He accepted worship from others and described a future time when He would judge all nations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Testimony of Jesus' Disciples&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The disciples of Jesus also held a clear belief in His divinity and uncreated nature. The Gospel of John reveals that Jesus is the eternal Word who was with God and was God from the very beginning. After encountering the risen Jesus, the apostle Thomas exclaimed, "My Lord and my God!" The apostle Paul referred to Christ as "God over all" and affirmed that in Him dwells the fullness of deity bodily. In the early days of the church, Christians prayed to Jesus and proclaimed forgiveness of sins in His name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Incarnation: God Made Flesh&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although Jesus is eternal and uncreated, He chose to take on human flesh at a specific point in history, known as the Incarnation. This act was essential for our salvation. The Incarnation signifies that the eternal Son, who always existed, became both truly God and truly man. However, it is important to note that there was never a time when the Son did not exist. Jesus has always been and will forever remain "our great God and Savior."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding whether Jesus was created or not has significant implications for our faith. If Jesus were merely a created being, He would not possess the divine authority or power to save us from our sins. However, recognizing His eternal nature affirms His role as our Savior and allows us to place our complete trust in Him. It also highlights the uniqueness of Christianity compared to other religious beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contemplating the eternal nature of Jesus challenges us to consider the depth of His divinity and the magnitude of His sacrifice for our salvation. Recognizing that Jesus is not created but the Creator Himself emphasizes His authority, knowledge, and power. It also encourages us to approach Him with reverence and worship, recognizing Him as the one who holds all things together and is worthy of our devotion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, according to the Bible and orthodox Christianity, Jesus was not created but is the eternal Son of God and the Creator of all things. His divine nature, demonstrated through His words and actions, sets Him apart from any created being. Understanding Jesus' eternal nature is crucial for our faith and enables us to fully trust in Him as our Savior.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Jesus Christ/The Life of Jesus/Timeline"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>The Ultimate Guide to the Life of Christ: Key Events and Teachings</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/life-of-christ/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-04-24T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-04-24T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-04-24:/life-of-christ/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;The Life of Christ&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The life of Christ is a central theme in Christianity. It is the story of God coming to earth as a man to save humanity from sin. The Bible provides a detailed account of the key events in the life of Christ, giving believers a glimpse into His teachings, miracles, and ultimate sacrifice. In this article, we will explore the significant moments in the life of Christ and their significance for Christians today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Birth of Christ&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story of Jesus' birth is well-known and cherished by believers. Found in the books of Matthew and Luke, it includes the elements of the Christmas story. Mary and Joseph, unable to find room at the inn, give birth to Jesus in a humble stable. Shepherds receive the news from a multitude of angels, and wise men from the East follow a star to worship the newborn King. The birth of Jesus fulfills prophecies from the Old Testament and marks the beginning of God's plan for salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; The birth of Christ demonstrates God's love for humanity and His willingness to enter into our world to save us. It shows that God's plan was set in motion long before Jesus' birth, as foretold by prophets throughout history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; How does the humble beginning of Jesus challenge our expectations of what a Savior should be like? How does it teach us about humility and service?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rn9-UNer6MQ" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Jesus' Baptism&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus' baptism by John the Baptist is a significant event in His life. Though Jesus did not need baptism for repentance, He chose to be baptized to identify Himself with sinners. John's baptism symbolized repentance, and by participating in it, Jesus demonstrated His mission to bear the sins of humanity on the cross. During His baptism, God affirmed Jesus' identity as His beloved Son, strengthening His resolve for what lay ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Jesus' baptism shows His willingness to fully identify with humanity and His obedience to God's plan. It affirms His divine nature and sets the stage for His ministry, where He would bring salvation to all who believe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; How does Jesus' baptism challenge our understanding of repentance? How does it inspire us to follow Him and be obedient to God's will?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Jesus' First Miracle&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Gospel of John records Jesus' first miracle, where He turns water into wine at a wedding in Cana. This miracle reveals Jesus' divine power over creation. It foreshadows the many miracles of healing and control over nature that He would perform throughout His ministry. The disciples witnessing this miracle were strengthened in their faith, and it revealed Jesus' true nature to those with eyes to see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Jesus' first miracle highlights His authority over the elements and His ability to transform ordinary things into extraordinary blessings. It reminds us that Jesus is not just a great teacher but also the Son of God who has power over all creation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; How does the miracle of turning water into wine demonstrate Jesus' ability to bring joy and abundance into our lives? How does it challenge our understanding of limitations?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Sermon on the Mount&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most famous sermons in history is the Sermon on the Mount, delivered by Jesus early in His ministry. In this sermon, found in Matthew 5-7, Jesus teaches His disciples about the principles of God's kingdom. He addresses various topics such as humility, righteousness, love for enemies, prayer, and fasting. The sermon challenges the legalistic approach of the Pharisees and emphasizes the importance of true faith and obedience to God's commands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; The Sermon on the Mount reveals the heart of God's kingdom and provides practical guidance for living a life that pleases Him. It exposes the futility of relying on human effort for righteousness and points to the need for a personal relationship with Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; How does Jesus' teaching in the Sermon on the Mount challenge our understanding of righteousness and morality? How does it inspire us to live out our faith in practical ways?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The life of Christ is a testament to God's love and His plan for salvation. The key events in His life, such as His birth, baptism, first miracle, and teachings, reveal His divine nature and purpose. As Christians, we are called to follow Jesus' example, embracing humility, obedience, and a deepening relationship with God. The life of Christ continues to inspire and transform lives today, offering hope, forgiveness, and eternal life to all who believe in Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; The life of Christ is not just ancient history; it has profound implications for our lives today. It challenges us to examine our beliefs, values, and actions in light of His teachings and example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; How can you apply the lessons from the life of Christ to your own life?

&lt;p&gt;Throughout Christian theology, there has been a question surrounding when Jesus, in His human form, knew that He was God. While the Bible does not explicitly address this question, there are indications that shed light on the matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus' Eternal Divinity: Jesus has always been …&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Jesus' Knowledge of His Divinity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout Christian theology, there has been a question surrounding when Jesus, in His human form, knew that He was God. While the Bible does not explicitly address this question, there are indications that shed light on the matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus' Eternal Divinity: Jesus has always been God, the second Person of the Trinity. He existed as God from eternity past and will continue to be God for eternity future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus' Self-Realization as God: As an adult, Jesus fully realized His divine nature. In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/8/John-8-58.html"&gt;John 8:58&lt;/a&gt;, Jesus declared, "Before Abraham was born, I am!" This statement expresses His eternal existence and divine nature. Additionally, in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/17/John-17-5.html"&gt;John 17:5&lt;/a&gt;, Jesus prayed to the Father, asking Him to glorify Him with the glory they shared before the world began.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus' Awareness as a Child: There are indications that even as a child, Jesus had an understanding of His divine identity and mission. When Joseph and Mary found Jesus missing during their journey back from Jerusalem, they discovered Him in the temple sitting among the teachers. When questioned about His actions, Jesus replied, "Why were you searching for me? . . . Didn’t you know I had to be in my Father’s house?" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/2/Luke-2-49.html"&gt;Luke 2:49&lt;/a&gt;). Although Joseph and Mary did not fully comprehend Jesus' words at that time, it suggests that Jesus already had awareness of His Sonship and the work ordained by the Father.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus' Growth in Wisdom: &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/2/Luke-2-52.html"&gt;Luke 2:52&lt;/a&gt; states that "Jesus grew in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and man." This growth implies that Jesus did not possess all knowledge from the beginning of His earthly life. While He never ceased being God, He willingly subjected Himself to human limitations and experienced physical, intellectual, social, and spiritual growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Veiling of Divinity: Jesus, in His human form, veiled His divinity in accordance with the Father's will. This veiling included limitations and the need for knowledge assimilation. Thus, Jesus willingly chose to experience and learn as a man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Limitations of Human Perspective: It is important to recognize that our understanding of Jesus' knowledge is limited by our human perspective. From the heavenly perspective, the Son knew from eternity past who He was and what His earthly work would entail. However, from the earthly perspective, it is unclear when exactly Jesus fully comprehended His divinity. This is a mystery that remains undisclosed in Scripture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question of when Jesus knew He was God holds theological significance as it explores the nature of Christ's incarnation and His humanity. Understanding Jesus' self-realization helps believers appreciate the depth of His sacrifice and the extent to which He identified with humanity. It also emphasizes Jesus' voluntary submission to human limitations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contemplating Jesus' self-realization invites us to reflect on the mystery of the Incarnation and the divine plan to save humanity. It reminds us that Jesus willingly entered into our world, experiencing growth, learning, and ultimately fulfilling His mission through His death and resurrection. Recognizing this deepens our appreciation for Jesus' love and sacrifice on our behalf.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Jesus Christ/The Life of Jesus/Timeline"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry></feed>

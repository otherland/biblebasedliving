&lt;p&gt;Yeshua Hamashiach, which means "Jesus the Messiah," is a significant name in the Christian faith. The name Jesus is the Greek form of the Hebrew name Yeshua, derived from the Hebrew word Yehoshua. This Hebrew name is also associated with the name Joshua (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Joshua/5/Joshua-5-15.html"&gt;Joshua 5:15&lt;/a&gt;) or Hoshea …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Yeshua Hamashiach&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeshua Hamashiach, which means "Jesus the Messiah," is a significant name in the Christian faith. The name Jesus is the Greek form of the Hebrew name Yeshua, derived from the Hebrew word Yehoshua. This Hebrew name is also associated with the name Joshua (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Joshua/5/Joshua-5-15.html"&gt;Joshua 5:15&lt;/a&gt;) or Hoshea (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Numbers/13/Numbers-13-8.html"&gt;Numbers 13:8&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Deuteronomy/32/Deuteronomy-32-44.html"&gt;Deuteronomy 32:44&lt;/a&gt;). Yeshua means "salvation" and is frequently mentioned throughout the Old Testament. It is from this Hebrew name that the Greek word Iesous, pronounced "yay-sus," or as we say it, "Jesus," originates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The term Mashiach, or Messiah in English, is derived from Hebrew and means "anointed one." In the Old Testament, God's mashiachs were individuals anointed with oil to symbolize the presence and authority of the Holy Spirit (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Leviticus/4/Leviticus-4-3.html"&gt;Leviticus 4:3&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-Samuel/12/1-Samuel-12-14.html"&gt;1 Samuel 12:14&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/2-Samuel/19/2-Samuel-19-21.html"&gt;2 Samuel 19:21&lt;/a&gt;). God had promised Israel an ultimate Mashiach or Messiah and provided over 300 prophecies about this Anointed One to ensure they could recognize Him when He came (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/53/Isaiah-53-1.html"&gt;Isaiah 53:1&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/22/Psalm-22-27.html"&gt;Psalm 22:27&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Daniel/9/Daniel-9-25.html"&gt;Daniel 9:25&lt;/a&gt;; 7:13). Jesus fulfilled every one of these prophecies, thus deserving the title Yeshua Hamaschiach for the Jewish people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the significance of the name Yeshua Hamashiach helps us grasp the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies concerning the coming Messiah. It underscores Jesus' role as the Anointed One who brings salvation to humanity. Recognizing Jesus as Yeshua Hamashiach deepens our understanding of His divine mission and enables us to appreciate His fulfillment of ancient promises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Name Yeshua&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The original Hebrew-Aramaic name of Jesus is Yeshua, which is a shortened form of Yehoshua. Just as "Mike" is short for "Michael," Yeshua is a shorter version of Yehoshua. The name Yeshua appears 27 times in the Hebrew Scriptures, primarily referring to the high priest after the Babylonian exile. In these instances, he is called both yehōshuˈa (see, e.g., &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Zechariah/3/Zechariah-3-3.html"&gt;Zechariah 3:3&lt;/a&gt;) and, more frequently, yeshuˈa (see, e.g., &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Ezra/3/Ezra-3-2.html"&gt;Ezra 3:2&lt;/a&gt;). Therefore, Yeshua's name was not unusual; multiple men in the Old Testament bore this name. It is important to note that Jesus' name being translated as Yeshua in English is not a pagan corruption but rather a natural linguistic transition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Meaning of Mashiach&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hebrew term Mashiach, or Messiah, means "anointed one." It refers to an individual set apart to serve Yahweh. In the Old Testament, individuals chosen by God were anointed with oil to symbolize the presence and authority of the Holy Spirit. This anointing signified their consecration for specific roles, such as prophets, priests, and kings. The title of Messiah carried the expectation of God's chosen savior who would bring salvation and deliverance to His people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Jesus as the Fulfillment of Prophecy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout the Old Testament, God provided numerous prophecies about the coming Messiah. These prophecies described specific details regarding His birthplace (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Micah/5/Micah-5-2.html"&gt;Micah 5:2&lt;/a&gt;), lineage (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/49/Genesis-49-10.html"&gt;Genesis 49:10&lt;/a&gt;), and purpose (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/53/Isaiah-53-5.html"&gt;Isaiah 53:5&lt;/a&gt;). Jesus fulfilled each of these prophecies with precision. He was born in Bethlehem (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/2/Matthew-2-1.html"&gt;Matthew 2:1-6&lt;/a&gt;), descended from King David (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/1/Luke-1-32.html"&gt;Luke 1:32-33&lt;/a&gt;), and offered Himself as the ultimate sacrifice for sin (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-Peter/2/1-Peter-2-24.html"&gt;1 Peter 2:24&lt;/a&gt;). Through His life, death, and resurrection, Jesus accomplished what was foretold in the Old Testament.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fulfillment of prophecies concerning Jesus' birth, life, death, and resurrection demonstrates the divine orchestration of God's plan. It affirms that Jesus is the long-awaited Messiah promised throughout the Old Testament. Reflecting on the fulfillment of these prophecies strengthens our faith in God's sovereignty and His faithfulness to fulfill His promises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Jesus' Name in Different Languages&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus came into the world to offer salvation and forgiveness to everyone who calls upon His name. The Bible declares that whoever believes in Him will not perish but have eternal life (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/3/John-3-16.html"&gt;John 3:16-18&lt;/a&gt;). It is important to note that God is not offended by our languages or our differences. Throughout the Bible, Yahweh identified Himself by different names as He interacted with people in various ways. Jesus referred to Himself as the "Son of Man" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/26/Matthew-26-24.html"&gt;Matthew 26:24&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/22/Luke-22-22.html"&gt;Luke 22:22&lt;/a&gt;), and others addressed Him as "Teacher" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/8/Matthew-8-19.html"&gt;Matthew 8:19&lt;/a&gt;) and "Rabbi" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/1/John-1-49.html"&gt;John 1:49&lt;/a&gt;). Jesus never corrected anyone's pronunciation or use of a messianic title as long as they came to Him in faith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The name we use when we come to Jesus in faith appears to be unimportant to Him. He hears our hearts regardless of the words our mouths speak (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/9/Luke-9-47.html"&gt;Luke 9:47&lt;/a&gt;). There is power in the name of Jesus, not in its pronunciation but in the person to whom it refers – our Lord, Redeemer, and King. Therefore, we should not be ashamed to use the name Jesus in our prayers, worship, and witness. If we desire to connect with the Jewishness of our Messiah, we can refer to Him by His original name, Yeshua. However, it is crucial to remember that our salvation is not dependent on the pronunciation of a particular name but on our relationship with Jesus Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The significance of Jesus' name lies not in its pronunciation but in the person behind it. Rather than getting caught up in debates about the correct way to say His name, let us focus on our relationship with Him. Our faith should be grounded in the person of Jesus and the salvation He offers, rather than in specific linguistic details. Let us worship and serve Him with reverence and love, knowing that He is the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies and the Savior of all who believe in Him.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Jesus Christ/The Identity of Jesus/Names"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Exalting Jesus: The Supreme Name Above All Names</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/jesus-name-above-all-names/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-08-15T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-08-15T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-08-15:/jesus-name-above-all-names/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Jesus: The Name Above All Names&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bible tells us that the name of Jesus is above every other name. In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Philippians/2/Philippians-2-9.html"&gt;Philippians 2:9-11&lt;/a&gt;, the apostle Paul declares, “Therefore God exalted him to the highest place and gave him the name that is above every name, that at the name …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Jesus: The Name Above All Names&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bible tells us that the name of Jesus is above every other name. In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Philippians/2/Philippians-2-9.html"&gt;Philippians 2:9-11&lt;/a&gt;, the apostle Paul declares, “Therefore God exalted him to the highest place and gave him the name that is above every name, that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, in heaven and on earth and under the earth, and every tongue acknowledge that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.” This passage highlights the exalted status of Jesus and the authority that comes with His name. Let's explore what this means and why it matters for Christians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Jesus' Humility and Exaltation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this passage, Paul emphasizes the importance of humility by presenting Jesus as the ultimate example. He explains that Jesus, who is fully God, willingly emptied Himself of His divine privileges and took on the form of a humble servant. Despite being equal with God, Jesus chose to live a life of obedience and service, ultimately sacrificing Himself on the cross for the salvation of humanity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through His self-emptying and obedience, Jesus demonstrated unparalleled humility. As a result, God exalted Him to the highest place of honor. Jesus, who stooped down low, was raised by the Father to His glorious position in heaven. This exaltation includes receiving a name above all names, a name that acknowledges Jesus Christ's absolute lordship as divine King of the universe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Supreme Authority of Jesus&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The name that is above every other name signifies Jesus' supreme authority over all creation. It is a divine name that carries immense weight and demands worship. In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Philippians/2/Philippians-2-10.html"&gt;Philippians 2:10&lt;/a&gt;, Paul states that every knee will bow at the name of Jesus—in heaven, on earth, and even under the earth. This means that every created being will acknowledge Jesus as Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is crucial to note that this universal acknowledgment of Jesus' authority does not imply universal salvation. Instead, it points to the time when every creature will recognize His sovereignty. Jesus, who sits at the right hand of God in the place of honor, is Lord over all. He is the one Lord, through whom all things were created and through whom we live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This supreme authority of Jesus extends to both the living and the dead. He is the Lord upon whom the church calls, our Mediator, Intercessor, and Reconciler. Jesus is the One who grants us entrance into the Kingdom of Heaven. By acknowledging Jesus as Lord, we affirm His divinity and recognize His supreme authority over our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding that Jesus has been given the name above all names has significant implications for our faith and daily lives. Here are a few reasons why this truth matters:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Worship&lt;/strong&gt;: Recognizing Jesus as Lord means acknowledging His divine authority and responding with heartfelt worship. We should bow our knees and submit ourselves to Him in reverence and adoration.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Tzm9ALtCszA" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Humility&lt;/strong&gt;: Jesus' example of humility challenges us to cultivate a humble attitude in our own lives. Just as He emptied Himself for the sake of others, we are called to set aside our selfish desires and serve one another with love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Obedience&lt;/strong&gt;: Jesus' obedience to the Father's will, even unto death, sets an example for us to follow. We should strive to obey God's commands and live a life that brings glory to Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Salvation&lt;/strong&gt;: Recognizing Jesus as Lord is essential for salvation. It is through faith in Him that we receive forgiveness of sins and eternal life. By acknowledging His lordship, we enter into a personal relationship with Him and experience the transformation of our hearts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hope&lt;/strong&gt;: The exalted status of Jesus gives us hope for the future. As believers, we can rest assured that He has conquered sin and death, and one day He will return to establish His kingdom fully. This hope encourages us to persevere through trials and challenges, knowing that our ultimate victory is in Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does recognizing Jesus as the name above all names impact your understanding of His authority in your life?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In what ways can you emulate Jesus' humility in your relationships with others?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does acknowledging Jesus as Lord influence your worship and obedience?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reflect on the hope that comes from knowing Jesus has been exalted. How does this hope shape your perspective and actions?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember, the name of Jesus is not just a mere title but represents His supreme authority and divinity. As followers of Christ, let us continually honor and acknowledge Him as Lord, allowing His name to have its rightful place in our lives.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Jesus Christ/The Identity of Jesus/Names"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Unveiling the Truth About Jesus H Christ: The Ultimate Guide for Christian Believers</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/jesus-h-christ/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-07-31T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-07-31T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-07-31:/jesus-h-christ/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Jesus H Christ&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The phrase "Jesus H. Christ" is a profane expletive that is often used in surprise, disappointment, or frustration. However, it is important to note that using this phrase is considered taking the Lord's name in vain and is seen as disrespectful by believers.

&lt;h3&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The phrase "Jesus H. Christ" is a profane expletive that is often used in surprise, disappointment, or frustration. However, it is important to note that using this phrase is considered taking the Lord's name in vain and is seen as disrespectful by believers. In this article, we will explore the origins of the expression "Jesus H. Christ" and why it is important to treat the name of Jesus with reverence and honor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Origin of "Jesus H. Christ"&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exact origin of the expression "Jesus H. Christ" is somewhat uncertain, but it likely developed from early Christian abbreviations or monograms for the name of Jesus Christ. In ancient times, the name of the Lord was sometimes abbreviated in Christian inscriptions, sculptures, and paintings. One common abbreviation was IHC, which represented the Greek letters iota, eta, and sigma – the first, second, and last letters of Jesus' name in Greek.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over time, this abbreviation was misunderstood by those who were not familiar with Latin. They mistook the iota (I) for a J and interpreted the C as meaning "Christ." This left only the H as an initial, leading to the expression "Jesus H. Christ." The earliest reported use of this phrase dates back to the mid-1800s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Taking the Lord's Name in Vain&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the expression "Jesus H. Christ" or any form of taking the Lord's name in vain goes against God's commandment not to misuse His name (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Exodus/20/Exodus-20-7.html"&gt;Exodus 20:7&lt;/a&gt;). Taking the Lord's name in vain means treating it irreverently or misusing it in an oath, which has been happening since biblical times (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Leviticus/19/Leviticus-19-12.html"&gt;Leviticus 19:12&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mJ_cQj0pTIk" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;God's name reflects His character and presence, and it carries great significance. As believers, we are called to honor and respect His name. In fact, God elevated Jesus to the highest place of honor in His kingdom and gave Him a name above all other names (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Philippians/2/Philippians-2-9.html"&gt;Philippians 2:9-10&lt;/a&gt;). Therefore, speaking the name of Jesus Christ lightly or irreverently dishonors Him and may result in God's punishment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the significance of the name of Jesus Christ helps us cultivate a deeper reverence for Him. As Christians, it is crucial that we approach His name with utmost respect and honor. By doing so, we demonstrate our love and devotion to Him and reflect His character to the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take a moment to reflect on how you use the name of Jesus Christ. Are you speaking it with reverence and honor, or are you using it flippantly or in a profane manner? Consider how you can cultivate a deeper respect for His name in your daily life and interactions with others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the phrase "Jesus H. Christ" may be used in a humorous or casual context, it is important to recognize that it is a profane expression that disrespects the name of Jesus Christ. As believers, we are called to honor and reverence His name, recognizing its significance and the authority it carries. Let us strive to speak His name with reverence and love, reflecting His character to the world around us.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Jesus Christ/The Identity of Jesus/Names"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Unveiling the Divine: Immanuel Jesus, the Savior of Souls</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/immanuel-jesus/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-07-18T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-07-18T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-07-18:/immanuel-jesus/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Immanuel Jesus&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The name "Immanuel" is significant in the Bible, particularly in relation to the birth of Jesus Christ. In the book of Isaiah, the prophet Isaiah declares a prophecy about a virgin who will conceive and give birth to a son, and he will be called Immanuel. This prophecy …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Immanuel Jesus&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The name "Immanuel" is significant in the Bible, particularly in relation to the birth of Jesus Christ. In the book of Isaiah, the prophet Isaiah declares a prophecy about a virgin who will conceive and give birth to a son, and he will be called Immanuel. This prophecy is initially fulfilled during Isaiah's time but ultimately points to the birth of Jesus. In the Gospel of Matthew, it is mentioned that the birth of Jesus fulfills this prophecy. However, it's important to note that Immanuel is not Jesus' given name but rather one of the names given to him in the Old and New Testaments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Meaning of Immanuel&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Immanuel means "God with us." It signifies that Jesus is God in human form and that he dwelt among humanity during his incarnation. He is not just an ordinary human being but God himself who came to be with us. This concept demonstrates the divine nature of Jesus and emphasizes his presence and accessibility to us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Names Given to Jesus&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vKYkhGDEQXs" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout the Bible, Jesus is referred to by various names that describe his character, role, and attributes. While these names are not necessarily his given name, they serve as accurate descriptions of who he is and what he does. Some of these names include "Wonderful Counselor," "Mighty God," "Everlasting Father," and "Prince of Peace" as prophesied by Isaiah. These names highlight the extraordinary nature of Jesus and his divine qualities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Name Given by Jeremiah&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jeremiah, another prophet in the Bible, also provides insight into the name of the coming Messiah. He prophesies that the Messiah will be called "The LORD is our righteousness." While Jesus was never called this specific name during his time on earth, it reflects his role in bringing righteousness to humanity. Through Jesus, we can receive the righteousness of God, as he is both God in the flesh and the one who makes us righteous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Multiple Names, Same Person&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as George Herman Ruth was known by various names like "Babe," "the Bambino," "the Sultan of Swat," or "the Colossus of Clout," Jesus can be referred to by different names. These names reflect his divine nature, miraculous work, and personal history. While Jesus is his given name, we can also call him Immanuel or any of the other names that capture his character and role.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Significance of Immanuel&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The inclusion of the name Immanuel in the prophecy and its fulfillment in Jesus underscores several important truths. Firstly, it affirms that Jesus is God incarnate, God in human form, who came to dwell among us. Secondly, it assures us that God keeps his promises, as the virgin birth of Jesus fulfills the prophecy made by Isaiah centuries before. Thirdly, it emphasizes that Jesus is always with us, demonstrating his omnipotence, omniscience, perfection, and unfailing love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the significance of Immanuel helps us grasp the profound nature of Jesus' identity and mission. It reminds us that Jesus is not just a historical figure or a wise teacher but God himself who chose to enter into human history for our salvation. Recognizing Jesus as Immanuel deepens our appreciation for his divine attributes and his constant presence in our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider the implications of Jesus being called Immanuel, "God with us." How does this truth impact your understanding of Jesus' identity and his relationship with you? How does knowing that God keeps his promises through the fulfillment of prophecies like the birth of Jesus increase your confidence in him? Take a moment to reflect on the significance of Immanuel in your own faith journey.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Jesus Christ/The Identity of Jesus/Names"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Unlocking the Meaning of Immanuel: A Christian Revelation</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/what-does-immanuel-mean/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-06-18T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-06-18T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-06-18:/what-does-immanuel-mean/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Immanuel: God With Us&lt;/h2&gt;

It appears three times in the Bible, twice in the Old Testament book of Isaiah and once in the Gospel of Matthew. In Isaiah, the name Immanuel was given …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Immanuel: God With Us&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The name Immanuel is derived from Hebrew and means "God with us" or "God is with us." It appears three times in the Bible, twice in the Old Testament book of Isaiah and once in the Gospel of Matthew. In Isaiah, the name Immanuel was given to a child born during the time of King Ahaz as a sign to the king that Judah would receive relief from attacks by Israel and Syria. The prophecy stated that a virgin would conceive and give birth to a son who would be called Immanuel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Gospel of Matthew, this prophecy is seen as being fulfilled through Jesus Christ. Mary, a virgin from Nazareth who was engaged to Joseph, conceived a child through the Holy Spirit. The angel who appeared to Joseph confirmed this and instructed him to name the child Jesus. Matthew recognized that Jesus is the fulfillment of Isaiah's prophecy, as he is the embodiment of Immanuel, "God with us."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus, as Immanuel, is not just a partial revelation of God with us but rather God with us in all His fullness. He is fully human yet fully God. Through Jesus, God walked among humanity just as He did with Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden. Jesus' arrival demonstrates God's faithfulness to fulfill His promises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus' purpose as Immanuel was not only to live among us but also to die for our sins on the cross. Through His sacrifice and shed blood, we can be reconciled to God. When we are born again by His Spirit, Christ comes to live within us. Our Immanuel is not just present during our earthly lives but will be with us forever. After His resurrection, Jesus promised to be with us always until the end of the age.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding and embracing Jesus as Immanuel has profound implications for our faith. It signifies that God is not distant or detached from us but instead desires to be intimately involved in our lives. Through Jesus, God has made Himself known to humanity, revealing His character, love, and grace. This revelation invites us to have a personal relationship with Him and experience His presence in our daily lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recognizing Jesus as Immanuel also assures us of God's faithfulness and reliability. Just as He fulfilled the prophecy of Immanuel through Jesus, we can trust that He will fulfill His promises to us. We can find comfort and hope knowing that we are never alone because God is with us every step of the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does the concept of Immanuel change your perspective on the presence of God in your life?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In what ways can you experience the reality of Immanuel in your day-to-day life?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does knowing that Jesus is God with us impact your understanding of His sacrifice on the cross?&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout the Bible, there are numerous names and titles given to Jesus Christ, each revealing different aspects of His nature, position, and work. These names provide us with a deeper understanding of who Jesus is and what He accomplished on earth for our salvation. Let's explore some of the prominent names of Jesus and their significance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Chief Cornerstone&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Ephesians/2/Ephesians-2-20.html"&gt;Ephesians 2:20&lt;/a&gt; describes Jesus as the "Chief Cornerstone" of the church. Just as a cornerstone holds a building together, Jesus cements together believers from all backgrounds into one structure built on faith in Him. This name emphasizes His role in unifying all believers into one body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Firstborn over all creation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Colossians/1/Colossians-1-15.html"&gt;Colossians 1:15&lt;/a&gt; refers to Jesus as the "Firstborn over all creation." This does not mean that He was the first thing God created, but rather that He holds the rank and pre-eminence over all things. Jesus is the highest authority and occupies the most exalted position in the universe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Head of the Church&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Ephesians/1/Ephesians-1-22.html"&gt;Ephesians 1:22&lt;/a&gt; and other passages, Jesus is described as the "Head of the Church." This title affirms that Jesus is the supreme ruler of the Church. Unlike earthly kings or popes, He alone has authority over those who have placed their faith in Him for salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Holy One&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus is referred to as the "Holy One" in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Acts/3/Acts-3-14.html"&gt;Acts 3:14&lt;/a&gt; and other verses. This name signifies His holiness in both His divine and human nature. Through His death, we are made holy and pure before God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Judge&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Acts/10/Acts-10-42.html"&gt;Acts 10:42&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/2-Timothy/4/2-Timothy-4-8.html"&gt;2 Timothy 4:8&lt;/a&gt; describe Jesus as the appointed Judge of the world. He will dispense rewards and judgment. This highlights His authority to judge all people according to their actions and faith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;King of kings and Lord of lords&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-Timothy/6/1-Timothy-6-15.html"&gt;1 Timothy 6:15&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Revelation/19/Revelation-19-16.html"&gt;Revelation 19:16&lt;/a&gt;, Jesus is titled the "King of kings and Lord of lords." This means that Jesus has dominion over all authority on earth, including kings and rulers. No one can prevent Him from accomplishing His purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Light of the World&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus proclaimed Himself as the "Light of the World" in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/8/John-8-12.html"&gt;John 8:12&lt;/a&gt;. He came into a world darkened by sin to shed light and truth through His work and teachings. Those who trust in Him have their eyes opened to the truth and walk in the light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Prince of Peace&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/9/Isaiah-9-6.html"&gt;Isaiah 9:6&lt;/a&gt; calls Jesus the "Prince of Peace." This does not mean that He came to bring peace to the world in the absence of war, but rather to reconcile humanity with God. Through His death, Jesus brings peace between God and mankind, ending the separation caused by sin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Son of God&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The title "Son of God" affirms the deity of Christ. &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/1/Luke-1-35.html"&gt;Luke 1:35&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/1/John-1-49.html"&gt;John 1:49&lt;/a&gt; refer to Jesus as the "only begotten of the Father" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/1/John-1-14.html"&gt;John 1:14&lt;/a&gt;). This name emphasizes His divine nature and highlights His unique relationship with God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Son of Man&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The phrase "Son of Man" emphasizes both the humanity and messianic role of Jesus. It is used in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/5/John-5-27.html"&gt;John 5:27&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/14/Mark-14-63.html"&gt;Mark 14:63&lt;/a&gt;. This title signifies that Jesus is fully human while also being divine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Word&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nQWFzMvCfLE" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/1/John-1-1.html"&gt;John 1:1&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-John/5/1-John-5-7.html"&gt;1 John 5:7-8&lt;/a&gt;, Jesus is referred to as the "Word." This name denotes that Jesus is the second person of the triune God, who spoke all things into existence during creation. He is co-eternal with God the Father.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Word of God&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Revelation/19/Revelation-19-12.html"&gt;Revelation 19:12-13&lt;/a&gt; mentions a name given to Christ that only He knows. This name is the "Word of God." It represents the mysterious nature of His divine person and His role as the source of eternal life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Word of Life&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-John/1/1-John-1-1.html"&gt;1 John 1:1&lt;/a&gt;, Jesus is described as the "Word of Life." This means that Jesus not only spoke words that lead to eternal life but is Himself the embodiment of life. Through Him, we receive the eternal life of joy and fulfillment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Alpha and Omega&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus declared Himself to be the "Alpha and Omega" in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Revelation/1/Revelation-1-8.html"&gt;Revelation 1:8&lt;/a&gt; and 22:13. This title signifies that He is the beginning and end of all things. Only the true God can claim this statement of eternality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Emmanuel&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The name "Emmanuel," meaning "God with us," is mentioned in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/9/Isaiah-9-6.html"&gt;Isaiah 9:6&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/1/Matthew-1-23.html"&gt;Matthew 1:23&lt;/a&gt;. It affirms that Jesus, born in Bethlehem, is God Himself who came to earth in human form to live among His people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;I Am&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/8/John-8-58.html"&gt;John 8:58&lt;/a&gt;, Jesus ascribed to Himself the title "I Am." This declaration led the Jews to try to stone Him for blasphemy because they understood that He was declaring Himself to be the eternal God, the unchanging Yahweh of the Old Testament.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Lord of All&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Acts/10/Acts-10-36.html"&gt;Acts 10:36&lt;/a&gt; proclaims Jesus as the "Lord of All." This title highlights His sovereignty over the entire world, all nations, and especially those whom God has chosen as His people—both Jews and Gentiles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;True God&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-John/5/1-John-5-20.html"&gt;1 John 5:20&lt;/a&gt;, Jesus is described as the "True God." This assertion affirms His divinity and declares Him to be the one and only true God. It reinforces the biblical teaching that there is only one God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Author and Perfecter of our Faith&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/12/Hebrews-12-2.html"&gt;Hebrews 12:2&lt;/a&gt; refers to Jesus as the "Author and Perfecter of our Faith." This means that Jesus is the founder and sustainer of our faith. He is the source of our salvation and the one who brings it to completion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Bread of Life&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/6/John-6-35.html"&gt;John 6:35&lt;/a&gt; and 6:48, Jesus calls Himself the "Bread of Life." Just as physical bread sustains life, Jesus is the spiritual bread that gives and sustains eternal life. He provides nourishment and salvation through His body, broken for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Bridegroom&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/9/Matthew-9-15.html"&gt;Matthew 9:15&lt;/a&gt; presents Jesus as the "Bridegroom." This imagery portrays the special relationship between Christ and the Church. Believers are bound to Him in a covenant of grace that cannot be broken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Deliverer&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/11/Romans-11-26.html"&gt;Romans 11:26&lt;/a&gt; describes Jesus as our "Deliverer." Just as God delivered the Israelites from bondage in Egypt, Jesus is our deliverer from the bondage of sin. He sets us free and brings us into a new life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Good Shepherd&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/10/John-10-11.html"&gt;John 10:11&lt;/a&gt; and 10:14, Jesus refers to Himself as the "Good Shepherd." This title draws on the analogy of a shepherd who cares for and protects his sheep. Jesus laid down His life for His sheep, demonstrating His love and care for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;High Priest&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/2/Hebrews-2-17.html"&gt;Hebrews 2:17&lt;/a&gt; describes Jesus as the "High Priest." In Jewish tradition, the high priest would make atonement for the sins of the people once a year. Jesus fulfilled this role once and for all through His sacrifice on the cross.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Lamb of God&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/1/John-1-29.html"&gt;John 1:29&lt;/a&gt; presents Jesus as the "Lamb of God." In Old Testament law, a spotless lamb was sacrificed to atone for sin. Jesus became that sacrificial Lamb, willingly giving His life to take away our sins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Mediator&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-Timothy/2/1-Timothy-2-5.html"&gt;1 Timothy 2:5&lt;/a&gt; refers to Jesus as the "Mediator" between God and humanity. As a mediator, Jesus reconciles us with God. He is the one and only Mediator, and praying to anyone else bypasses His crucial role.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Rock&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-Corinthians/10/1-Corinthians-10-4.html"&gt;1 Corinthians 10:4&lt;/a&gt;, Jesus is likened to a "Rock." Just as water flowed from the rock Moses struck in the wilderness, Jesus is the spiritual Rock from which flows the living waters of eternal life. He is the foundation upon which we build our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Resurrection and Life&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/11/John-11-25.html"&gt;John 11:25&lt;/a&gt; reveals Jesus as the "Resurrection and Life." Through His death and resurrection, Jesus has the power to resurrect sinners to eternal life. Our old selves are buried with Him, and we are raised to walk in newness of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Savior&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/1/Matthew-1-21.html"&gt;Matthew 1:21&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/2/Luke-2-11.html"&gt;Luke 2:11&lt;/a&gt; proclaim Jesus as the "Savior." He saves us by dying to redeem us, giving us the Holy Spirit for renewal, empowering us to overcome spiritual enemies, sustaining us in trials and even death, and raising us up on the last day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;True Vine&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/15/John-15-1.html"&gt;John 15:1&lt;/a&gt;, Jesus describes Himself as the "True Vine." Just as branches draw nourishment from a vine, believers find their sustenance in Jesus. He provides the living water of salvation and nourishment through His Word.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Way, Truth, Life&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus declares Himself to be the "Way, Truth, and Life" in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/14/John-14-6.html"&gt;John 14:6&lt;/a&gt;. He is the exclusive path to God, the embodiment of truth in a world filled with lies, and the true source of eternal life. In Him, we find ultimate meaning and purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the names of Jesus Christ helps us grasp His divine nature, His role in our salvation, and His authority over all creation. These names reveal His character and highlight His unique position as the Son of God and our Savior. By knowing who Jesus is, we can deepen our faith and trust in Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think About It:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does it mean for Jesus to be the cornerstone of the Church?
How does Jesus being the "Light of the World" impact our lives?
Why is it significant that Jesus is referred to as both the "Son of God" and the "Son of Man"?
In what ways does Jesus being the "Good Shepherd" bring comfort and assurance to believers?
How does understanding Jesus as the "Mediator" affect our approach to prayer and worship?

&lt;p&gt;In the discussion surrounding the name of our Lord, some individuals argue that He should only be referred to as "Yeshua" and that using the name "Jesus" is blasphemous. They claim that the name "Jesus" is unbiblical because it originated from a modern invention, the letter "J," which …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Yeshua Jesus&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the discussion surrounding the name of our Lord, some individuals argue that He should only be referred to as "Yeshua" and that using the name "Jesus" is blasphemous. They claim that the name "Jesus" is unbiblical because it originated from a modern invention, the letter "J," which did not exist in Greek or Hebrew. However, it is important to note that "Yeshua" is the Hebrew name for our Lord, and its English equivalent is "Joshua," while "Jesus" is the Greek transliteration of the Hebrew name. Both names, "Joshua" and "Jesus," essentially refer to the same person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Changing the language of a word does not alter its meaning. For instance, we call a bound and covered set of pages a "book." In German, it becomes a "Buch," in Spanish it is a "libro," and in French, it is a "livre." The language may change, but the object remains the same. Similarly, we can refer to Jesus as "Jesus," "Yeshua," or even "耶稣" (Yēsū in Cantonese) without changing His nature. In any language, His name signifies "The Lord Is Salvation."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding the controversy over the letter "J," it is essentially inconsequential. It is true that the languages in which the Bible was written did not have a letter equivalent to "J." However, this does not mean that we cannot use the spelling "Jesus" when speaking or writing in English. Different languages have their own spellings for words. For example, Americans write "Savior," while the British write "Saviour." The presence or absence of a particular letter does not alter whom we are referring to. Jesus is still the Savior, regardless of how we spell His name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bible does not command us to exclusively speak or write His name in Hebrew or Greek. It never even suggests such an idea. On the Day of Pentecost, when the message of the gospel was proclaimed, the apostles spoke in various languages to ensure that people from different language groups could understand. The Holy Spirit enabled Jesus to be known in a way that transcended language barriers. Therefore, spelling or language does not hold significance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We refer to Him as "Jesus" because, as English-speaking individuals, we have come to know Him through English translations of the Greek New Testament. Scripture does not prioritize any specific language over another, nor does it indicate that we must use Hebrew when addressing the Lord. The command is simply to "call on the name of the Lord," with the promise that we "shall be saved." Whether we call on Him in English, Korean, Hindi, or Hebrew, the result remains the same: the Lord is salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ivUb1K0B0zE" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the significance of Jesus' name can help us appreciate His role as our Savior and recognize that His salvation is available to all people, regardless of their native language. It emphasizes the universality of His message and highlights the power of the Holy Spirit to bridge linguistic gaps. By focusing on His redemptive work rather than getting caught up in debates about names and spellings, we can maintain unity and direct our efforts towards proclaiming His gospel to all nations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does knowing that Jesus' name means "The Lord Is Salvation" influence your understanding of His purpose and mission?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you think it is important to pronounce Jesus' name exactly as it would have been in Hebrew or Greek? Why or why not?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reflect on &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Acts/2/Acts-2-21.html"&gt;Acts 2:21&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Joel/2/Joel-2-32.html"&gt;Joel 2:32&lt;/a&gt;. What do these verses teach us about calling on the name of the Lord for salvation?&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we talk about Jesus, we often refer to Him as "Jesus Christ." However, it's important to understand that Christ is not His last name but a title. In Greek, the word Christ is transliterated from a term meaning "Anointed One" or "Chosen One." Its Hebrew …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Jesus: The Chosen One&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we talk about Jesus, we often refer to Him as "Jesus Christ." However, it's important to understand that Christ is not His last name but a title. In Greek, the word Christ is transliterated from a term meaning "Anointed One" or "Chosen One." Its Hebrew equivalent is the source of the word Messiah. So, when we say "Jesus Christ," we are acknowledging that Jesus is the Chosen One of God, the Messiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Distinction between Jesus and the Christ&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Acts/18/Acts-18-5.html"&gt;Acts 18:5&lt;/a&gt;, we see a clear distinction between the name Jesus and the title the Christ: "Paul was occupied with the word, testifying to the Jews that the Christ was Jesus" (ESV). This passage highlights that Paul's preaching was focused on proving that Jesus was indeed the Messiah, the Christ. Jesus, the man, fulfilled the role of the Christ as foretold in the Law and the Prophets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Identifying People in Biblical Times&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike today, people in biblical times did not have last names or surnames. Instead, they were identified in various ways. For instance, individuals with common names like Jesus would be distinguished through other means. Some were identified by their fathers' names, such as Levi, son of Alphaeus (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/2/Mark-2-14.html"&gt;Mark 2:14&lt;/a&gt;), James, son of Zebedee (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/3/Mark-3-17.html"&gt;Mark 3:17&lt;/a&gt;), James, son of Alphaeus (verse 18), and Bartimaeus, son of Timaeus (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/10/Mark-10-46.html"&gt;Mark 10:46&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Others were known by their hometowns or home countries. For example, Jesus was often referred to as "Jesus of Nazareth" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/10/Mark-10-47.html"&gt;Mark 10:47&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/24/Luke-24-19.html"&gt;Luke 24:19&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/18/John-18-5.html"&gt;John 18:5&lt;/a&gt;). Similarly, individuals like Lucius of Cyrene (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Acts/13/Acts-13-1.html"&gt;Acts 13:1&lt;/a&gt;), Mary Magdalene (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/27/Matthew-27-56.html"&gt;Matthew 27:56&lt;/a&gt;), and Judas Iscariot (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/10/Matthew-10-4.html"&gt;Matthew 10:4&lt;/a&gt;) were identified by their places of origin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, some people received nicknames to distinguish them from others with the same name. Jesus gave the disciple Simon the nickname Peter (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/1/John-1-42.html"&gt;John 1:42&lt;/a&gt;). Another Simon was referred to as "Simon the Zealot" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/10/Matthew-10-4.html"&gt;Matthew 10:4&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Understanding Jesus' Mission&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Christ is not Jesus' last name, referring to Him as "Jesus Christ" helps identify His mission in the world. Jesus has various titles, each revealing a different aspect of His identity and purpose. The angel told Mary that He would be called "the Son of God" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/1/Luke-1-35.html"&gt;Luke 1:35&lt;/a&gt;), and Isaiah prophesied that He would be known as "Immanuel" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/7/Isaiah-7-14.html"&gt;Isaiah 7:14&lt;/a&gt;). Others recognized Him as the "Son of David" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/15/Matthew-15-22.html"&gt;Matthew 15:22&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/R9qoqQ75ifs" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless of the title we use, we must acknowledge that "there is salvation in no one else!" God has given us no other name under heaven through which we can be saved (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Acts/4/Acts-4-12.html"&gt;Acts 4:12&lt;/a&gt;, NLT). As Christians, we believe that Jesus has been given "the name above all names," and one day, every knee will bow and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Philippians/2/Philippians-2-9.html"&gt;Philippians 2:9&lt;/a&gt;–11).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the significance of Jesus' title as the Christ deepens our appreciation for His role in fulfilling God's plan for salvation. Recognizing that Christ is not a last name but a title helps us grasp the biblical narrative more accurately. By acknowledging Jesus as the Chosen One, we affirm His unique position as the Messiah and Savior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider how knowing that Christ is not Jesus' last name but a title impacts your understanding of biblical references to Jesus. How does this knowledge enhance your understanding of Jesus' mission and purpose? Reflect on the significance of Jesus being identified by various titles and what they reveal about His identity.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Jesus Christ/The Identity of Jesus/Names"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Discover the Divine Meaning Behind the Name Jesus: A Christian Revelation</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/meaning-name-jesus/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-04-09T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-04-09T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-04-09:/meaning-name-jesus/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;The Meaning of the Name Jesus&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The name Jesus holds immense significance and power. It is a name that is above every other name, and it carries great meaning. In the Bible, the name Jesus is given to Joseph and Mary through the angels, and it means "Yahweh saves" or "Yahweh is salvation". This name is derived from Hebrew and Aramaic, and it combines "Ya," an abbreviation for Yahweh, the name of Israel's God, with the verb "yasha," which means "rescue," "deliver," or "save."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When translated from Hebrew into Koine Greek, the original language of the New Testament, the name Yeshua becomes Iēsous. In English, Iēsous is pronounced as Jesus. Thus, Yeshua, Joshua, and Jesus all mean "Yahweh saves" or "the Lord is salvation." It is essential to note that the name Jesus was quite common in first-century Judea. To distinguish Him, Jesus was often referred to as "Jesus of Nazareth," indicating His childhood home in Nazareth, Galilee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite its commonness, the name Jesus carries tremendous significance. Jesus was sent by God for a specific purpose, and His personal name bears witness to that mission. Just as the Yeshua/Joshua in the Old Testament led his people to victory over the Canaanites, the Yeshua/Jesus in the New Testament leads His people to victory over sin and their spiritual enemies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the meaning of the name Jesus helps us grasp His purpose and identity as our Savior. The name Jesus encapsulates His mission to save and deliver us from sin. It also highlights His humility and humanity as He emptied Himself of His glory to become a humble man. By living up to His name, Jesus brings glory to God and offers us salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Think About It:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider the significance of the name Jesus in your own life. How does knowing that Jesus' name means "Yahweh saves" impact your understanding of His mission and purpose? How does it shape your relationship with Him?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Authority and Power of the Name Jesus&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The name of Jesus holds great power and authority because of whom it represents. It is in the person of Christ Jesus that we find salvation, forgiveness of sins, and the source of all healing and miracles. The Bible reveals various truths about the authority and power found in the name of Jesus:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Salvation is in the name of Jesus alone: The book of Acts declares that there is no other name under heaven given to mankind by which we must be saved (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Acts/4/Acts-4-11.html"&gt;Acts 4:11&lt;/a&gt;–12). Jesus is the cornerstone of our salvation, and through Him alone can we find redemption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forgiveness of sins is received through the name of Jesus: &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Acts/10/Acts-10-43.html"&gt;Acts 10:43&lt;/a&gt; states that everyone who believes in Him receives forgiveness of sins through His name. Believing in Jesus and confessing Him as Lord brings about forgiveness and reconciliation with God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5Xwc_E_q3oQ" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Believers are baptized in the name of Jesus: Peter instructs believers to repent, be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of sins, and receive the gift of the Holy Spirit (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Acts/2/Acts-2-38.html"&gt;Acts 2:38&lt;/a&gt;). Baptism in the name of Jesus signifies our identification with Him and our participation in His death, burial, and resurrection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Healing and miracles are performed in the name of Jesus: The book of Acts recounts numerous instances where healing and miracles were performed by invoking the name of Jesus. By having faith in His name, people experienced complete healing and restoration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Praying in the name of Jesus: Jesus Himself teaches believers to pray in His name, asking for anything according to His will (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/14/John-14-13.html"&gt;John 14:13&lt;/a&gt;–14). Praying in the name of Jesus means praying in His authority, aligning our prayers with what He would pray.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recognizing the authority and power inherent in the name of Jesus helps us understand the significance of His role as our Savior and mediator. It encourages us to approach Him with confidence, knowing that His name carries the weight to bring about salvation, forgiveness, healing, and answers to our prayers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Think About It:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reflect on your own prayer life. How often do you pray in the name of Jesus? Do you fully grasp the authority and power that His name represents? Consider how praying in His name can transform your perspective and deepen your relationship with Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Living in the Name of Jesus&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In every way, Jesus lived up to His name. The name Jesus reminds us of the power, presence, and purpose of the risen Christ. It assures us that God's gracious intention is to save us. When people spoke or acted in the name of Jesus in the Bible, they did so as representatives of the Lord, carrying His authority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As believers, our lives are also meant to be lived in the name of Jesus. &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Colossians/3/Colossians-3-17.html"&gt;Colossians 3:17&lt;/a&gt; instructs us to do everything in the name of Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through Him. By living our lives in His name, we bring glory to God and honor the mission and purpose that Jesus fulfilled on our behalf.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding that our lives are to be lived in the name of Jesus challenges us to align our thoughts, words, and actions with His character and teachings. It reminds us that we are called to be ambassadors for Christ, representing Him in everything we do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Think About It:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider how you can practically live your life in the name of Jesus. How can you honor Him through your thoughts, words, and actions? How might living in His name impact your relationships, work, and daily decisions?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, the name Jesus holds immense significance and power. It means "Yahweh saves" or "Yahweh is salvation." Jesus was sent by God to fulfill His mission of saving and delivering humanity from sin. The name Jesus represents authority, power, and salvation. It is through His name that we find forgiveness, healing, and the source of all miracles. As believers, our lives are meant to be lived in the name of Jesus, bringing glory to God and reflecting His character. May we continually recognize the significance of the name Jesus and live in a manner that honors Him.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Jesus Christ/The Identity of Jesus/Names"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry></feed>

&lt;p&gt;The term "Christ" holds a significant meaning in Christianity. Contrary to popular belief, "Christ" is not Jesus' last name but rather a title given to Him. The word "Christ" originates from the Greek word "Christos," which translates to "anointed one" or "chosen one." This Greek term …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;What Does Christ Mean?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The term "Christ" holds a significant meaning in Christianity. Contrary to popular belief, "Christ" is not Jesus' last name but rather a title given to Him. The word "Christ" originates from the Greek word "Christos," which translates to "anointed one" or "chosen one." This Greek term is equivalent to the Hebrew word "Messiah." Therefore, when we refer to Jesus Christ, we are acknowledging Him as Jesus the Messiah or Jesus the Anointed One.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In ancient Israel, anointing with oil was a symbolic act that represented someone being set apart for God's service. It was commonly performed when individuals were appointed to positions of authority, such as kings, priests, and prophets. The anointing signified God's choosing and consecration of the individual for a specific purpose. While the literal meaning of anointing refers to the application of oil, it can also signify one's consecration by God, even if actual oil is not used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout the Old Testament, there are numerous prophetic passages that foretell the coming of a Messiah who would deliver God's people from various hardships and challenges. These prophecies created an expectation among ancient Israelites that their Messiah would arrive with military might and liberate them from their captivity under earthly kings and pagan nations. However, the New Testament reveals that Jesus the Messiah brings about a far greater deliverance. His mission is not only to rescue people from physical oppressors but also to save them from the power and penalty of sin itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus embodies the title of Christ through two significant anointings. On two separate occasions, He was anointed with oil by two different women. These acts are recorded in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/26/Matthew-26-6.html"&gt;Matthew 26:6&lt;/a&gt;–7 and &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/7/Luke-7-37.html"&gt;Luke 7:37&lt;/a&gt;–38. Although these events hold importance, the most significant anointing Jesus received was through the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit's anointing upon Jesus signifies that He is God's chosen and anointed one, fulfilling the Old Testament prophecies concerning the Messiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the title of Christ is crucial for Christians as it highlights Jesus' role as the Savior and Deliverer. The Bible often refers to Jesus as the Christ, emphasizing His divine appointment and mission. By recognizing Jesus as the Christ, Christians acknowledge Him as the fulfillment of God's promise to send a Messiah to rescue humanity from sin and its consequences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the meaning behind the title "Christ" deepens our comprehension of Jesus' purpose and significance. It emphasizes that Jesus is not merely a historical figure or a wise teacher but rather God's chosen Savior who came to redeem humanity. Recognizing Jesus as the Christ encourages us to place our trust in Him and rely on His work of salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By embracing Jesus as the Christ, we acknowledge that He has the authority and power to deliver us from sin, reconcile us with God, and grant us eternal life. This understanding shapes our faith, hope, and relationship with Him. It also motivates us to share this good news with others so that they, too, may come to know Jesus as their Savior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have you ever considered what the term "Christ" means and its significance in relation to Jesus?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does understanding Jesus as the Christ impact your understanding of His work of salvation?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reflect on how embracing Jesus as the Christ shapes your daily life and interactions with others.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consider how you can share the good news of Jesus' role as the Christ with those around you who may not be familiar with this concept.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The phrase "King of kings" and "Lord of lords" is mentioned multiple times in Scripture. It is used to describe God the Father, Jesus Christ, as well as earthly kings who used the title to express their absolute sovereignty over their realms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1. God …&lt;/h3&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;King of Kings, Lord of Lords&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The phrase "King of kings" and "Lord of lords" is mentioned multiple times in Scripture. It is used to describe God the Father, Jesus Christ, as well as earthly kings who used the title to express their absolute sovereignty over their realms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1. God the Father: King of Kings&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The title "King of kings" is applied to God the Father in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-Timothy/6/1-Timothy-6-15.html"&gt;1 Timothy 6:15&lt;/a&gt;. This title emphasizes His supreme authority and dominion over all other rulers. It signifies that there is no higher authority than God Himself. He is the ultimate King, ruling over all creation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2. Jesus Christ: King of Kings and Lord of Lords&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The title "King of kings" is also attributed to Jesus Christ in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Revelation/17/Revelation-17-14.html"&gt;Revelation 17:14&lt;/a&gt; and 19:16. In these passages, Jesus is described as the one who has the power and authority to exercise absolute dominion over all creation. He is given the full title "KING OF KINGS AND LORD OF LORDS." This means that in the end, all other rulers will be conquered or abolished, and Jesus alone will reign supreme as King and Lord of all the earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to note that the order of the title is reversed in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Revelation/17/Revelation-17-14.html"&gt;Revelation 17:14&lt;/a&gt;, which states "Lord of lords and King of kings." The reversal of the order does not change the meaning; it simply emphasizes both aspects of Jesus' authority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;3. Earthly Kings: Temporary Sovereignty&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The phrase "king of kings" is also used to refer to earthly kings who used it to assert their absolute sovereignty over their realms. For example, Artaxerxes and Nebuchadnezzar, kings of Persia and Babylon respectively, used this title to express their authority and dominance over their subjects. However, it is crucial to understand that their sovereignty was temporary and limited to their earthly kingdoms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the concept of Jesus being the King of kings and Lord of lords is essential for Christians. It reminds us of the ultimate authority and sovereignty of God the Father and Jesus Christ. It reinforces our trust in God's plan and His ability to conquer all opposition. It also encourages us to submit to the lordship of Jesus Christ, recognizing His supreme authority in our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reflecting on Jesus' title as the King of kings and Lord of lords should lead us to consider our own response to His authority. Are we willingly submitting to His lordship in our lives? Do we recognize His absolute sovereignty over every aspect of our existence? Let us meditate on these questions and strive to align our lives with the kingship of Jesus Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Absolute Rule of Jesus&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The title "King of kings and Lord of lords" signifies the absolute rule of Jesus over all creation. Throughout Scripture, there are numerous references to His pre-eminence over other rulers, emphasizing His power and authority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1. Jesus' Rule Proclaimed by Isaiah&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/40/Isaiah-40-23.html"&gt;Isaiah 40:23&lt;/a&gt;–24 declares that the Lord brings earthly rulers to nothing, making them emptiness. The mere breath of the Lord will carry them off like stubble. This passage highlights the temporary nature of human rulership compared to the everlasting dominion of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2. Daniel's Vision of One like a Son of Man&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Daniel/7/Daniel-7-13.html"&gt;Daniel 7:13&lt;/a&gt;–14, Daniel has a vision of one whom he calls "the Ancient of Days" - God the Father - who gives an everlasting dominion over all people, nations, and languages to "one like a son of man" - referring to God the Son, Jesus Christ. This vision reveals that Jesus will have an eternal kingdom that will never be destroyed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;3. Jesus' Superiority over Angels&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The writer of Hebrews emphasizes Jesus' superiority over the angels, stating that He is the radiance of the glory of God and upholds the universe by the word of His power (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/1/Hebrews-1-3.html"&gt;Hebrews 1:3&lt;/a&gt;). This passage highlights Jesus' role in creation and His authority over all things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;4. Humility to Exaltation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul discusses Jesus' humility and exaltation in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Philippians/2/Philippians-2-5.html"&gt;Philippians 2:5&lt;/a&gt;–11. He explains that Jesus humbled Himself, even to the point of death on a cross, and as a result, God highly exalted Him and bestowed on Him the name that is above every name. This passage demonstrates the journey from Jesus' humble earthly ministry to His glorification as King of kings and Lord of lords.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding Jesus' absolute rule helps us recognize His sovereignty and power. It assures us that no power, king, or lord can oppose Him and win. This knowledge strengthens our faith and trust in Him as we face challenges and difficulties. It reminds us that Jesus is in control, and ultimately, He will triumph over all opposition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contemplating the absolute rule of Jesus should lead us to reflect on our own lives. Do we acknowledge His authority in every aspect of our existence? Are we surrendering our will to His perfect rule? Let us examine our hearts and strive to align ourselves with His kingship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dQl4izxPeNU" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Triumph of Jesus as King of Kings&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book of Revelation vividly portrays the Kingship of Jesus Christ. It reveals His ultimate triumph over all opposition and His establishment of an everlasting kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1. The Lamb Worthy to Open the Scroll&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Revelation 5, the Lamb - referring to Jesus - is the only one found worthy to open the scroll containing the judgments of God. This signifies His authority and dominion as King of kings and Lord of lords.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2. The Kingdom of Christ&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Revelation 11, voices in heaven proclaim that the kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of Christ, and He will reign forever and ever. This passage emphasizes the eternal nature of Jesus' kingdom and His ultimate victory over all earthly powers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;3. Satan Thrown Down&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revelation 12 reveals that the authority of Christ is what causes Satan to be thrown down to earth. This highlights Jesus' power over the forces of evil and His ability to overcome all opposition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;4. Conquering Kings and Lord of Lords&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Revelation/17/Revelation-17-12.html"&gt;Revelation 17:12&lt;/a&gt;–14, the Lamb conquers all those arrayed against Him, emphasizing His victorious reign as King of kings and Lord of lords. This passage reinforces that no power can stand against Him, and He holds ultimate authority over all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;5. Triumphant Coming and Wrath of God&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Revelation 19, Jesus is depicted as coming triumphantly to strike the nations and tread the winepress of the wrath of God. His authority to execute judgment is derived from His title as King of kings and Lord of lords. This passage showcases His ultimate victory over evil and His establishment of a righteous rule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The portrayal of Jesus' triumph as King of kings in the book of Revelation brings hope to believers. It assures us that regardless of the challenges we face in this world, Jesus is ultimately victorious. It encourages us to persevere in our faith, knowing that He will establish His righteous kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reflecting on Jesus' triumph as King of kings should lead us to consider our response as His followers. Are we living in light of His ultimate victory? Are we actively participating in establishing His kingdom on earth? Let us examine our lives and seek to align ourselves with His purposes and plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The title "King of kings and Lord of lords" signifies the absolute rule and authority of God the Father and Jesus Christ. It reminds us that there is no higher authority than God Himself. Jesus' reign as King of kings and Lord of lords emphasizes His power, sovereignty, and triumph over all opposition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding and embracing Jesus' kingship brings reassurance, hope, and direction to our lives as believers. It encourages us to submit to His lordship and align ourselves with His purposes. Let us acknowledge Jesus as our King of kings and Lord of lords, trusting in His ultimate victory and eagerly anticipating the establishment of His righteous kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Jesus Christ/The Identity of Jesus/Titles"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Agnus Dei: The Sacred Lamb of God Revealed</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/agnus-dei/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-08-24T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-08-24T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-08-24:/agnus-dei/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Agnus Dei: The Lamb of God&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The term Agnus Dei, which is Latin for "Lamb of God," holds significant biblical and theological meaning. It is derived from &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/1/John-1-29.html"&gt;John 1:29&lt;/a&gt;, where John the Baptist refers to Jesus as the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Agnus Dei: The Lamb of God&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The term Agnus Dei, which is Latin for "Lamb of God," holds significant biblical and theological meaning. It is derived from &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/1/John-1-29.html"&gt;John 1:29&lt;/a&gt;, where John the Baptist refers to Jesus as the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world. This imagery is also found in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Revelation/5/Revelation-5-9.html"&gt;Revelation 5:9-14&lt;/a&gt;, where the Lamb who was slain is worshipped by angels and all of creation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Biblical Basis for Agnus Dei&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/1/John-1-29.html"&gt;John 1:29&lt;/a&gt; introduces the concept of Jesus as the Lamb of God. In this verse, John the Baptist sees Jesus approaching and declares, "Look, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!" This declaration connects Jesus to the sacrificial system in Jewish tradition, where lambs were offered as sacrifices for sin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Revelation/5/Revelation-5-9.html"&gt;Revelation 5:9-14&lt;/a&gt; further emphasizes the significance of the Lamb. Here, the Lamb who has been slain is worshipped by angels, living creatures, and elders. They proclaim that the Lamb is worthy to receive power, wealth, wisdom, honor, glory, and praise. This passage portrays both the sacrifice and victory of Christ as the Lamb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Two Meanings of Agnus Dei&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The term Agnus Dei can refer to two things within church history and liturgy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A figure or symbol of a lamb with a halo and bearing a cross or banner. This representation of Christ as the Lamb can often be seen in church artwork and stained glass windows.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A prayer to Christ known as the Agnus Dei prayer. This prayer is part of the Roman Catholic liturgy and is recited during Mass. In Latin, it goes: "Agnus Dei, qui tolis peccata mundi, miserere nobis. Agnus Dei, qui tolis peccata mundi, dona nobis pacem," which translates to "Lamb of God, who takes away the sins of the world, have mercy on us. Lamb of God, who takes away the sins of the world, grant us peace."&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Understanding Agnus Dei in Different Christian Traditions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Catholics and Evangelicals both recognize Jesus as the Lamb of God who takes away the sins of the world, there are differences in how they apply this concept:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9Ynx1W8PGEw" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Roman Catholic theology, the Agnus Dei prayer is seen as a plea for mercy, similar to pleading for leniency before a judge. It is part of a cycle that involves sin, confession, and penance. The faithful Catholic believes that through this process, grace is gradually infused, ultimately making them righteous enough to be saved by God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Evangelicals who have trusted in Christ for salvation, the Agnus Dei prayer takes on a different meaning. They understand that they have already received mercy and are at peace with God through faith in Christ. Therefore, their prayer would be one of thanksgiving for the blessings they have already received.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the significance of Agnus Dei helps Christians grasp the depth of Christ's sacrifice and victory over sin. It reminds believers of Jesus' role as the Lamb who takes away their sins and grants them peace with God. Recognizing Agnus Dei allows Christians to approach God with humility and gratitude for His mercy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider the imagery of Jesus as the Lamb of God. How does this concept impact your understanding of His sacrifice? How does it shape your relationship with Him? Take a moment to reflect on the significance of Agnus Dei in your own spiritual journey.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Jesus Christ/The Identity of Jesus/Titles"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Discover the Power of the Wonderful Counselor: Ultimate Guide for Christian Wisdom</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/wonderful-counselor/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-08-19T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-08-19T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-08-19:/wonderful-counselor/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Wonderful Counselor&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The term "Wonderful Counselor" is used in the Bible to describe the coming Messiah, Jesus Christ. In the book of Isaiah, the prophet Isaiah predicts the birth of a child who will fulfill the Davidic Covenant and bear the titles "Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Wonderful Counselor&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The term "Wonderful Counselor" is used in the Bible to describe the coming Messiah, Jesus Christ. In the book of Isaiah, the prophet Isaiah predicts the birth of a child who will fulfill the Davidic Covenant and bear the titles "Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/9/Isaiah-9-6.html"&gt;Isaiah 9:6&lt;/a&gt;). This prophecy was written nearly 800 years before the birth of Christ and served as a message of hope for the people of Israel during a tumultuous time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Character of the Messiah&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Isaiah refers to the Messiah as the "Wonderful Counselor," he is highlighting the extraordinary character of this coming King. The word "wonderful" in this context means "incomprehensible" or beyond our understanding. It is a word that emphasizes the awe-inspiring nature of Jesus. He is wonderful in a way that surpasses anything we can grasp or comprehend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus demonstrated His wonderfulness in various ways during His time on earth. His conception in the womb of a virgin was a miraculous event that showcased His divine nature (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/1/Matthew-1-23.html"&gt;Matthew 1:23&lt;/a&gt;). He displayed His wonderfulness through His power to heal, His amazing teaching, His perfect life, and His resurrection from the dead. Everything about Jesus is awe-inspiring and superior to any other kind of wonder. He is perfect in every way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Jesus as a Wise Counselor&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second part of the Messiah's title, "Counselor," portrays Jesus as a wise king who provides guidance to His people. In ancient Israel, a counselor was seen as someone with wisdom and insight, like King Solomon. Isaiah also uses this term to describe the LORD in another passage (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/28/Isaiah-28-29.html"&gt;Isaiah 28:29&lt;/a&gt;), saying that He is "wonderful in counsel and excellent in wisdom."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus is not just any counselor; He is uniquely qualified to advise us because He possesses all wisdom and knowledge. In Him are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Colossians/2/Colossians-2-3.html"&gt;Colossians 2:3&lt;/a&gt;). He understands human nature perfectly and knows what is in each person's heart (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/2/John-2-25.html"&gt;John 2:25&lt;/a&gt;). Jesus always knows the right course of action and can guide us with His infinite wisdom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Trusting Jesus as Our Wonderful Counselor&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As believers, we can trust Jesus as our Wonderful Counselor to listen to our problems and provide guidance. He encourages us to bring our worries to Him in prayer (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Philippians/4/Philippians-4-6.html"&gt;Philippians 4:6&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/James/1/James-1-5.html"&gt;James 1:5&lt;/a&gt;) and promises to guide our paths if we acknowledge Him in all our ways (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Proverbs/3/Proverbs-3-6.html"&gt;Proverbs 3:6&lt;/a&gt;). We can have confidence that He has our best interests at heart because He loves us unconditionally (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-John/4/1-John-4-19.html"&gt;1 John 4:19&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The love of Christ is so deep and wonderful that it is beyond our full understanding (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/5/Romans-5-8.html"&gt;Romans 5:8&lt;/a&gt;). His role as our Wonderful Counselor assures us that He understands what we are going through and knows how to lead us. We can rely on His wisdom and trust that His counsel will always be for our ultimate good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding Jesus as the Wonderful Counselor is crucial for our faith. It reminds us that we have access to divine wisdom and guidance through Him. In a world filled with uncertainty, confusion, and conflicting advice, knowing that we can turn to Jesus for counsel brings comfort and assurance. His perfect understanding of our needs and His infinite wisdom equip Him to guide us through any situation we face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does viewing Jesus as the Wonderful Counselor impact your perspective on seeking guidance in your life?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In what areas of your life do you need the counsel of Jesus? How can you seek His guidance more intentionally?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reflect on instances where you have experienced the wisdom and guidance of Jesus in your life. How did it affect your decisions and outcomes?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember, Jesus is not just a counselor; He is the Wonderful Counselor who can guide us with His perfect wisdom.

&lt;p&gt;The phrase "Alpha and Omega" is used in the book of Revelation to describe Jesus Christ. This phrase refers to the first and last letters of the Greek alphabet, symbolizing that Jesus is the beginning and end of all things. In Jewish tradition, using the first and last letters of the Hebrew alphabet represented the entirety of something from start to finish. Therefore, when Jesus calls Himself the Alpha and Omega, He is proclaiming His eternality and divinity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Jesus as the Beginning and End&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One meaning of Jesus being the Alpha and Omega is that He existed at the beginning of all things and will exist at the end. This declaration signifies that He has always existed and will continue to exist. As the second Person of the Trinity, Jesus played a vital role in creation. The apostle John affirms this by stating, "Through him all things were made; without him nothing was made that has been made" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/1/John-1-3.html"&gt;John 1:3&lt;/a&gt;). Furthermore, Jesus' Second Coming will mark the beginning of the end of creation as we know it (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/2-Peter/3/2-Peter-3-10.html"&gt;2 Peter 3:10&lt;/a&gt;). Being God incarnate, Jesus has no beginning or end in terms of time, existing from everlasting to everlasting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Jesus as the God of the Old Testament&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another meaning of Jesus as the Alpha and Omega is that it identifies Him as the God of the Old Testament. The prophet Isaiah attributes this aspect of Jesus' nature to the triune God in several verses. For example, Isaiah writes, "I, the Lord, am the first, and with the last I am He" (41:4). These passages emphasize the eternal nature of God. By proclaiming Himself as the Alpha and Omega, Jesus asserts His divinity and continuity with God as revealed in the Old Testament.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Jesus as Author and Finisher&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus as the Alpha and Omega means that He is both the author and finisher of our faith. This phrase highlights that Jesus initiates and completes our journey of faith. The book of Hebrews describes Him as the "author and finisher" of our faith (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/12/Hebrews-12-2.html"&gt;Hebrews 12:2&lt;/a&gt;). In other words, Jesus begins our faith walk and ensures its fulfillment. He is the sum and substance of the Scriptures, encompassing both the Law and the Gospel (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/1/John-1-1.html"&gt;John 1:1&lt;/a&gt;, 14). Jesus fulfills the requirements of the Law (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/5/Matthew-5-17.html"&gt;Matthew 5:17&lt;/a&gt;) and is the focal point of the gospel of grace through faith (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Ephesians/2/Ephesians-2-8.html"&gt;Ephesians 2:8-9&lt;/a&gt;). From the first verse of Genesis to the last verse of Revelation, Jesus is present throughout the Bible, representing the entirety and completion of salvation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding Jesus as the Alpha and Omega is essential for several reasons. Firstly, it affirms His divinity and eternal nature. By declaring Himself as such, Jesus establishes Himself as the one true God. Secondly, recognizing Jesus as the Alpha and Omega emphasizes His role in creation. He is not only the Creator but also the sustainer of all things. Lastly, acknowledging Jesus as both the author and finisher of our faith encourages us to trust in Him fully. He is faithful to complete what He has started in us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Think About It&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider the implications of Jesus being the Alpha and Omega in your life. How does knowing that Jesus has always existed and will always exist impact your trust in Him? Reflect on how Jesus' role in creation demonstrates His power and authority over all things. How does understanding Him as the author and finisher of your faith influence your perspective on your spiritual journey? Take time to meditate on these truths and allow them to deepen your relationship with Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Jesus Christ/The Identity of Jesus/Titles"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Jesus is Lord: Embracing the Ultimate Authority in Christian Faith</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/jesus-is-lord/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-08-15T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-08-15T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-08-15:/jesus-is-lord/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Jesus is Lord&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Christianity, the title "Lord" refers to someone who has authority, control, or power over others. It is a way of acknowledging someone as a master or ruler.

&lt;h3&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Christianity, the title "Lord" refers to someone who has authority, control, or power over others. It is a way of acknowledging someone as a master or ruler. In the time of Jesus, the term "Lord" was often used as a sign of respect towards earthly authorities. For example, when a leper called Jesus "Lord," it was an expression of respect for Him as a healer and teacher (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/8/Matthew-8-2.html"&gt;Matthew 8:2&lt;/a&gt;). However, after Jesus' resurrection, the title "Lord" took on a deeper meaning. It became a declaration of Jesus' deity, affirming that He is God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Deity of Jesus&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proclamation that "Jesus is Lord" signifies that Jesus is God. This understanding began with Thomas' exclamation when he saw the resurrected Jesus: "My Lord and my God!" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/20/John-20-28.html"&gt;John 20:28&lt;/a&gt;). From then on, the apostles preached that Jesus is Lord, meaning that He is God. In Peter's sermon on the Day of Pentecost, he declared that God had made Jesus, whom they crucified, both Lord and Messiah (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Acts/2/Acts-2-36.html"&gt;Acts 2:36&lt;/a&gt;). Peter also proclaimed in Cornelius's house that Jesus is "Lord of all" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Acts/10/Acts-10-36.html"&gt;Acts 10:36&lt;/a&gt;). The confession of "Jesus is Lord" is linked to His resurrection in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/10/Romans-10-9.html"&gt;Romans 10:9&lt;/a&gt;, emphasizing the significance of His lordship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Jesus' Authority and Sovereignty&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we say "Jesus is Lord," we acknowledge that Jesus has complete authority and power over all things. He is described as having "all authority in heaven and on earth" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/28/Matthew-28-18.html"&gt;Matthew 28:18&lt;/a&gt;). Jesus also claimed to be Lord numerous times during His earthly ministry (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/19/Luke-19-31.html"&gt;Luke 19:31&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/13/John-13-13.html"&gt;John 13:13&lt;/a&gt;). Furthermore, the New Testament equates the "LORD" mentioned in the Old Testament with the "Lord Jesus." For example, &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/34/Psalm-34-8.html"&gt;Psalm 34:8&lt;/a&gt; says, "Taste and see that the LORD is good," and in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-Peter/2/1-Peter-2-3.html"&gt;1 Peter 2:3&lt;/a&gt;, Jesus is referred to as the "Lord" who is good. This identification highlights Jesus' divine nature and His role as the ultimate authority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Humility of Jesus&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/R9qoqQ75ifs" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite His status as Lord and God, Jesus demonstrated humility during His time on earth. Through His Incarnation, He revealed the true meaning of meekness (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/11/Matthew-11-29.html"&gt;Matthew 11:29&lt;/a&gt;). Just before His arrest, Jesus used His authority to teach the disciples about humility by washing their feet (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/13/John-13-14.html"&gt;John 13:14&lt;/a&gt;). He taught that the last would be first in His kingdom (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/19/Matthew-19-30.html"&gt;Matthew 19:30&lt;/a&gt;). By exemplifying humility, Jesus showed that true lordship involves serving others rather than seeking power or control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Submission to Jesus' Authority&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To declare "Jesus is Lord" implies a commitment to obey Him. Jesus questioned why people called Him "Lord, Lord" but did not do what He said (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/6/Luke-6-46.html"&gt;Luke 6:46&lt;/a&gt;). Acknowledging Jesus' lordship logically leads to submitting to His authority. If Jesus is Lord, then He has ownership over our lives and has the right to guide and direct us. This submission to Jesus' authority is an essential aspect of being a follower of Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Significance of Believing in Jesus as Lord&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saying "Jesus is Lord" goes beyond mere words; it requires a genuine belief in the heart. The apostle Paul states that no one can truly say "Jesus is Lord" except by the Holy Spirit (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-Corinthians/12/1-Corinthians-12-3.html"&gt;1 Corinthians 12:3&lt;/a&gt;). Faith in the Lord Jesus is necessary for salvation (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Acts/16/Acts-16-31.html"&gt;Acts 16:31&lt;/a&gt;). When we acknowledge Jesus as Lord and Savior, we recognize His divinity and surrender our lives to Him. It is through this confession that we receive salvation and enter into a relationship with God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus is Lord, which means He is God and has supreme authority over all things. This truth is foundational in Christianity and has significant implications for believers. It requires acknowledging Jesus' deity, submitting to His authority, and living a life that reflects His teachings. As Christians, we are called to proclaim and live out the truth that Jesus is Lord. One day, every knee will bow and every tongue will acknowledge that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Philippians/2/Philippians-2-9.html"&gt;Philippians 2:9&lt;/a&gt;–11).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the lordship of Jesus is crucial for our faith. It shapes our view of God's authority, our relationship with Jesus, and how we live our lives as His followers. Recognizing Jesus as Lord impacts our worship, obedience, and service to Him. It is a foundational truth that leads us to salvation and transformation in Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does acknowledging Jesus as Lord impact your daily life?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In what areas of your life do you struggle to submit to Jesus' authority?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What steps can you take to deepen your understanding and experience of Jesus' lordship?&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Jesus Christ and Christ Jesus: Explained&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Jesus Christ and Christ Jesus&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus Christ and Christ Jesus are two terms used in the Bible to refer to the Son of God, but what is the significance of these titles? Let's take a closer look at these terms and their meaning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Jesus Christ and Christ Jesus: Explained&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The name "Jesus" refers to the human name given to the Son of God when He became incarnate and was born to Mary. On the other hand, "Christ" is a title that means "Messiah," "Anointed One," or "Chosen One." In some passages of the New Testament, you will find the term "Jesus Christ," where the human name is placed first, while in other instances, you will find "Christ Jesus," with the title placed first. This slight difference in word order has led some to wonder if there is any significance in using one term over the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In many languages, including English, word order can be changed for emphasis. Placing words at the beginning or end of a sentence tends to give them more attention. However, in this case, the difference between "Jesus Christ" and "Christ Jesus" is subtle. Both terms attribute the same honor to Jesus by using the title "Christ" alongside His personal name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Hymn in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Philippians/2/Philippians-2-5.html"&gt;Philippians 2:5-11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One important passage that sheds light on the significance of these titles is found in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Philippians/2/Philippians-2-5.html"&gt;Philippians 2:5-11&lt;/a&gt;. In this passage, the apostle Paul quotes an early Christian hymn that speaks about the kenosis or "emptying" of Jesus Christ as He took on human form. This hymn helps believers understand the theology behind Jesus' incarnation and sacrifice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hymn begins with God becoming man, using the term "Christ Jesus" to emphasize His heavenly title followed by His human name. It then ends with Jesus ascending to glory, using "Jesus Christ" to highlight His humanity followed by His heavenly title. This switch in terminology aligns perfectly with the theme of the hymn, reflecting the direction Jesus is taking in His journey from God to man and back to God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Usage of "Christ Jesus" and "Jesus Christ" by Apostles&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is interesting to note that the apostle Paul more frequently uses the term "Christ Jesus" compared to other apostles who usually say "Jesus Christ." John, for example, never writes "Christ Jesus" but always puts the human name first. This difference in usage may be attributed to Paul's unique perspective as someone who never physically walked with Jesus. He may have used "Christ Jesus" in a more formal way, recognizing Jesus' divine title alongside His human name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NBMJMAvccb4" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The Significance of "Jesus Christ" and "Christ Jesus"&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In most contexts, the difference between using "Jesus Christ" or "Christ Jesus" is insignificant. Placing the human name first slightly emphasizes the Lord's humanity, while placing the divine title first highlights His deity. However, regardless of the order, both titles convey the same truth: Jesus is the Christ, the Messiah, and the Chosen One of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the significance of the terms "Jesus Christ" and "Christ Jesus" helps us appreciate the depth of Jesus' identity. It reminds us that He is both fully God and fully man. This profound truth has major implications for our salvation and relationship with God. By becoming fully human, Jesus was able to reconcile us to God through His sacrifice on the cross. Recognizing Him as both Jesus Christ and Christ Jesus enables us to grasp the magnitude of His work on our behalf.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Think About It&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider how the use of "Jesus Christ" and "Christ Jesus" in scripture reveals both Jesus' divinity and humanity. Reflect on what it means for you personally that Jesus is both fully God and fully man. How does this impact your understanding of His sacrifice and your relationship with Him? Take a moment to thank God for sending His Son, Jesus Christ, to reconcile you to Himself.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Jesus Christ/The Identity of Jesus/Titles"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Discover the Divine Light: Morning Star Devotions for Christian Awakening</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/morning-star/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-05-31T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-05-31T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-05-31:/morning-star/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;The Morning Star&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept of the morning star is mentioned in the Bible, specifically in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/14/Isaiah-14-12.html"&gt;Isaiah 14:12&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Revelation/22/Revelation-22-16.html"&gt;Revelation 22:16&lt;/a&gt;. In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/14/Isaiah-14-12.html"&gt;Isaiah 14:12&lt;/a&gt;, it refers to Satan's fall from heaven: "How you have fallen from heaven, O morning star, son of the dawn! You have been …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;The Morning Star&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept of the morning star is mentioned in the Bible, specifically in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/14/Isaiah-14-12.html"&gt;Isaiah 14:12&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Revelation/22/Revelation-22-16.html"&gt;Revelation 22:16&lt;/a&gt;. In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/14/Isaiah-14-12.html"&gt;Isaiah 14:12&lt;/a&gt;, it refers to Satan's fall from heaven: "How you have fallen from heaven, O morning star, son of the dawn! You have been cast down to the earth, you who once laid low the nations!" (NIV). The King James Version (KJV) and New King James Version (NKJV) translate "morning star" as "Lucifer, son of the morning." This passage clearly identifies Satan as the morning star.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Revelation/22/Revelation-22-16.html"&gt;Revelation 22:16&lt;/a&gt;, Jesus refers to Himself as the morning star. This raises the question of why both Jesus and Satan are described as the morning star. To understand this, it is important to note that there are other concepts that are applied to both Jesus and Satan in the Bible. For example, in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Revelation/5/Revelation-5-5.html"&gt;Revelation 5:5&lt;/a&gt;, Jesus is referred to as the Lion of the tribe of Judah, while in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-Peter/5/1-Peter-5-8.html"&gt;1 Peter 5:8&lt;/a&gt;, Satan is compared to a lion seeking someone to devour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These similarities between Jesus and Satan serve different purposes. Jesus is compared to a lion because He is the King, royal, and majestic. In contrast, Satan is compared to a lion because he seeks to devour others. While there are similarities between Jesus and Satan in certain aspects, it is crucial to recognize that they are fundamentally different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The term "morning star" signifies a star that outshines all others. In this context, Jesus is described as the bright morning star. As God incarnate and the Lord of the universe, Jesus represents the most holy and powerful light in all creation. On the other hand, Satan's status as a morning star is limited to being a created being whose light only exists because God created it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to emphasize that while both Jesus and Satan can be described as morning stars, this does not equate them. Jesus is the one true bright morning star, the light of the world, while Satan is a poor imitation. Jesus' light is self-existent and unmatched.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/B-62lFq1NHU" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Understanding the concept of the morning star helps us grasp the differences between Jesus and Satan. It highlights Jesus' divine nature as the ultimate source of light and power. Recognizing that Satan is a created being reminds us of his limited authority and the inherent superiority of Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, this distinction serves as a reminder to Christians that we should not be deceived by false imitations or teachings that try to equate Jesus with anything or anyone less than His true glory. It reinforces the importance of staying rooted in Biblical truth and recognizing Jesus as the sole Savior and source of eternal life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does the concept of Jesus as the bright morning star impact your understanding of His power and authority?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In what ways can false imitations or teachings try to diminish Jesus' true glory in your life?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reflect on how recognizing Jesus as the ultimate source of light can bring hope and assurance in challenging times.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question of whether Jesus is Yahweh is a complex theological topic that requires an understanding of the biblical texts and the teachings of Christianity. The Bible refers to God as Yahweh in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Exodus/3/Exodus-3-13.html"&gt;Exodus 3:13-14&lt;/a&gt;, where He states, "I AM WHO I AM." This phrase, translated …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Is Jesus Yahweh&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question of whether Jesus is Yahweh is a complex theological topic that requires an understanding of the biblical texts and the teachings of Christianity. The Bible refers to God as Yahweh in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Exodus/3/Exodus-3-13.html"&gt;Exodus 3:13-14&lt;/a&gt;, where He states, "I AM WHO I AM." This phrase, translated from the Hebrew as YHWH, is often rendered as "LORD," "Yahweh," or "Jehovah" in English translations. It signifies God's self-existence and His independence from anything else for His existence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the foundational doctrines of Christianity is that Jesus is God. However, this teaching can be challenging to comprehend because the Bible also emphasizes that there is only one God. &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Deuteronomy/6/Deuteronomy-6-4.html"&gt;Deuteronomy 6:4&lt;/a&gt; states, "Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is one." This belief in the oneness of God is known as monotheism. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christianity teaches that there is one God who exists in a triune nature as three Persons within one God, a plurality of Persons who are one in essence. This doctrine is known as the Trinity. While fully acknowledging the complexity and mystery surrounding this concept, Christians affirm that Jesus, as part of the Trinity, is indeed Yahweh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout both the Old and New Testaments, there are verses that affirm Jesus' divine nature. In Psalm 2, for example, it speaks of the kings of the earth opposing both Yahweh and His Anointed (Messiah), referring to Jesus. It encourages people to submit to the Son to avoid His wrath and find refuge in Him. In numerous parables and teachings, Jesus uses titles and descriptions that align with those attributed to Yahweh in the Old Testament.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance, Jesus refers to Himself as "I AM" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Exodus/3/Exodus-3-14.html"&gt;Exodus 3:14&lt;/a&gt;) and claims to be the Shepherd (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/23/Psalm-23-1.html"&gt;Psalm 23:1&lt;/a&gt;), the Light (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/27/Psalm-27-1.html"&gt;Psalm 27:1&lt;/a&gt;), the Rock (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/18/Psalm-18-2.html"&gt;Psalm 18:2&lt;/a&gt;), the Ruler of all (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/9/Isaiah-9-6.html"&gt;Isaiah 9:6&lt;/a&gt;), the Judge of all nations (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Joel/3/Joel-3-12.html"&gt;Joel 3:12&lt;/a&gt;), the Bridegroom (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/62/Isaiah-62-5.html"&gt;Isaiah 62:5&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Hosea/2/Hosea-2-16.html"&gt;Hosea 2:16&lt;/a&gt;), and the eternal Word of God (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/40/Isaiah-40-8.html"&gt;Isaiah 40:8&lt;/a&gt;). In the New Testament, Jesus reiterates these claims and equates Himself with Yahweh, saying, "Anyone who has seen Me has seen the Father" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/14/John-14-9.html"&gt;John 14:9&lt;/a&gt;) and "I and the Father are one" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/10/John-10-30.html"&gt;John 10:30&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus also accepts worship nine times in the gospels, forgives sins, commands His disciples to pray in His name, and is referred to as God by the New Testament writers in multiple passages. These references include &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/3/Matthew-3-16.html"&gt;Matthew 3:16-17&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/1/John-1-1.html"&gt;John 1:1-3&lt;/a&gt;,14, &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/20/John-20-28.html"&gt;John 20:28&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/9/Romans-9-5.html"&gt;Romans 9:5&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Philippians/2/Philippians-2-5.html"&gt;Philippians 2:5-8&lt;/a&gt;,9-11, &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Colossians/1/Colossians-1-16.html"&gt;Colossians 1:16-19&lt;/a&gt;, 2:9-10, &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/1/Hebrews-1-8.html"&gt;Hebrews 1:8&lt;/a&gt;,13:8, &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Revelation/1/Revelation-1-8.html"&gt;Revelation 1:8&lt;/a&gt;,17, 2:8,17:14,19:16,21:6,and 22:13.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, according to Christian theology and the teachings of Scripture, Jesus is indeed Yahweh - the I AM, the God of the Old Testament. While comprehending the concept of the Trinity may be challenging due to its mysterious nature, it is essential to recognize that Christianity affirms one God who exists in three Persons within one divine essence.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Jesus Christ/The Identity of Jesus/Titles"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Unveiling the Meaning of Messiah: A Christian''s Guide to Redemption</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/what-does-messiah-mean/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-04-27T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-04-27T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-04-27:/what-does-messiah-mean/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;What Does Messiah Mean?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The term "Messiah" comes from the Hebrew word &lt;em&gt;mashiach&lt;/em&gt; and means "anointed one" or "chosen one." In Greek, the equivalent word is &lt;em&gt;christos&lt;/em&gt;, which in English is translated as "Christ." Essentially, the name "Jesus Christ" can be understood as "Jesus the Messiah." In biblical times, anointing …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;What Does Messiah Mean?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The term "Messiah" comes from the Hebrew word &lt;em&gt;mashiach&lt;/em&gt; and means "anointed one" or "chosen one." In Greek, the equivalent word is &lt;em&gt;christos&lt;/em&gt;, which in English is translated as "Christ." Essentially, the name "Jesus Christ" can be understood as "Jesus the Messiah." In biblical times, anointing someone with oil was a symbolic act that signified God's consecration or setting apart of that person for a specific role. So, an "anointed one" was someone chosen by God for a special purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Old Testament, individuals were anointed for various positions such as prophet, priest, and king. For example, God instructed Elijah to anoint Elisha as his successor (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-Kings/19/1-Kings-19-16.html"&gt;1 Kings 19:16&lt;/a&gt;). Aaron was anointed as Israel's first high priest (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Leviticus/8/Leviticus-8-12.html"&gt;Leviticus 8:12&lt;/a&gt;). Samuel anointed both Saul and David as kings of Israel (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-Samuel/10/1-Samuel-10-1.html"&gt;1 Samuel 10:1&lt;/a&gt;; 16:13). These men held positions that were considered "anointed."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the Old Testament also prophesied the coming of a Deliverer who would be chosen by God to redeem Israel (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/42/Isaiah-42-1.html"&gt;Isaiah 42:1&lt;/a&gt;; 61:1–3). This Deliverer was referred to as the Messiah by the Jews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus of Nazareth is identified as the prophesied Messiah in the New Testament (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/4/Luke-4-17.html"&gt;Luke 4:17&lt;/a&gt;–21; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/4/John-4-25.html"&gt;John 4:25&lt;/a&gt;–26). The Bible provides evidence that Jesus is indeed the Chosen One. For instance, the apostle John wrote, "These [miracles] are written that you may believe that Jesus is the Messiah, the Son of God, and that by believing you may have life in his name" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/20/John-20-31.html"&gt;John 20:31&lt;/a&gt;). Additionally, Peter testified that Jesus is "the Messiah, the Son of the living God" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/16/Matthew-16-16.html"&gt;Matthew 16:16&lt;/a&gt;). The ultimate proof of Jesus' identity as the Messiah is His resurrection from the dead. &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Acts/10/Acts-10-39.html"&gt;Acts 10:39&lt;/a&gt;–43 provides eyewitness testimony to His resurrection and declares that "he is the one whom God appointed as judge of the living and the dead."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/A6-wlevyAIs" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus fulfills the roles of Prophet, Priest, and King, which further confirms His identity as the Messiah. He is a prophet because He embodies and proclaims the Word of God (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/1/John-1-1.html"&gt;John 1:1&lt;/a&gt;–18; 14:24; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/24/Luke-24-19.html"&gt;Luke 24:19&lt;/a&gt;). He is a priest because His death atones for our sins and reconciles us to the Father (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/2/Hebrews-2-17.html"&gt;Hebrews 2:17&lt;/a&gt;; 4:14). And He is a king because, after His resurrection, God bestowed all authority on Him (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/18/John-18-36.html"&gt;John 18:36&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Ephesians/1/Ephesians-1-20.html"&gt;Ephesians 1:20&lt;/a&gt;–23; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Revelation/19/Revelation-19-16.html"&gt;Revelation 19:16&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's important to note that the Jews of Jesus' day had certain expectations about the Messiah. They anticipated that He would redeem Israel by overthrowing Roman rule and establishing an earthly kingdom (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Acts/1/Acts-1-6.html"&gt;Acts 1:6&lt;/a&gt;). However, it was only after Jesus' resurrection that His disciples began to understand the true meaning of the prophecies in the Old Testament regarding the Messiah's mission (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/24/Luke-24-25.html"&gt;Luke 24:25&lt;/a&gt;–27). The Messiah's primary purpose was to deliver His people from sin (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/8/John-8-31.html"&gt;John 8:31&lt;/a&gt;–36). This salvation was accomplished through Jesus' death and resurrection (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/12/John-12-32.html"&gt;John 12:32&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/3/John-3-16.html"&gt;John 3:16&lt;/a&gt;). In the future, Jesus the Messiah will also deliver His people from their physical enemies when He establishes His Kingdom on earth (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/9/Isaiah-9-1.html"&gt;Isaiah 9:1&lt;/a&gt;–7).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the meaning of "Messiah" is significant for Christians because it reveals Jesus' identity as the Chosen One who fulfilled Old Testament prophecies. Recognizing Jesus as the Messiah is crucial for our faith because it affirms His unique role in our salvation. By believing in Him, we can have eternal life in His name (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/20/John-20-31.html"&gt;John 20:31&lt;/a&gt;). The Messiah's anointed positions as Prophet, Priest, and King point to the comprehensive work He accomplished on our behalf. Jesus' role as Prophet reveals that He is the embodiment of God's Word and the ultimate revealer of truth. As our High Priest, Jesus offered Himself as a sacrifice for our sins, making reconciliation with God possible. And as King, He has been given all authority and will establish His Kingdom on earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider the significance of Jesus being the anointed Messiah. How does His fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies strengthen your faith? In what ways does understanding Jesus' roles as Prophet, Priest, and King impact your view of Him? Reflect on the future reign of Jesus as the Messiah and how it brings hope and assurance to your life.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Jesus Christ/The Identity of Jesus/Titles"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry></feed>

&lt;p&gt;In the Bible, the word "Savior" refers to someone who saves others. Throughout history, God has been referred to as the Savior, rescuing His people from various dangers.

&lt;p&gt;In the Bible, the word "Savior" refers to someone who saves others. Throughout history, God has been referred to as the Savior, rescuing His people from various dangers. However, when Christians refer to Jesus as the Savior, they are acknowledging His role in saving humanity on a much grander scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To understand Jesus' role as the Savior, we must first recognize our desperate situation. As human beings, we have sinned against God and voluntarily separated ourselves from Him. Sin leads to death, and as a result, everything in our world is now dying. Because God is holy, He will punish sin, leading to eternal separation from Him. Without Jesus, we are helplessly enslaved by sin and unable to achieve holiness on our own. We are born on a path that leads to condemnation and eternal separation from God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, Jesus steps in as our Savior. Being God Himself, Jesus is perfect and sinless. He lived a righteous life and did not deserve to die. Yet, He willingly chose to die a horrific death on the cross for us, paying the price for our sins. Through His death and resurrection, Jesus established His victory over sin and evil. And He will return one day to remove evil completely from the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jABSW-UuT1o" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By trusting in Jesus, anyone can receive eternal life and be saved from the consequences of sin. Jesus saves us from sin by forgiving our sins and justifying us with His blood. He saves us from God's righteous punishment by offering Himself as a sacrifice in our place. He saves us from death by granting us eternal life. He saves us from the degradation of the world by separating us from its influence and empowering us to live according to His teachings. He also saves us from the devil, who deceives the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus' salvation is not merely about saving us from something; it is also about saving us for something. Through His death and resurrection, Jesus made it possible for us to have a relationship with God. We can approach God as our heavenly Father, reconciled to Him through Jesus' sacrifice. By God's grace, we are saved for an eternity with Him, where we can worship Him, enjoy Him, and experience His love forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to understand that salvation is only possible through trusting in Jesus. No other person, philosophy, or work can reconcile us to our holy Creator. When we confess our sins and put our trust in Jesus, we receive eternal life, a relationship with God, and the grace to cover all our sins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding Jesus as the Savior is essential for Christians because it reveals the depth of God's love and mercy towards humanity. It helps us grasp the seriousness of sin and the need for salvation. Recognizing Jesus as the Savior also gives us hope and assurance that we can be rescued from the consequences of sin and have eternal life with God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reflect on your own need for a Savior. How does understanding Jesus as your Savior impact your perspective on sin and salvation?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consider the significance of Jesus willingly sacrificing Himself for our sake. How does this demonstrate His love for humanity?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does knowing Jesus as the Savior affect your understanding of God's character and His desire for a relationship with you?&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Christians, we believe that Jesus Christ is alive. While the idea of someone rising from the dead may seem difficult to comprehend, it is supported by historical evidence and biblical teachings. In this article, we will explore the concept of Jesus' resurrection and explain why it matters to our faith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Jesus' Pre-Existence and Eternal Life&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before discussing Jesus' resurrection, it is important to understand that He existed before His earthly life. According to &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Philippians/2/Philippians-2-5.html"&gt;Philippians 2:5&lt;/a&gt;–11 and &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/1/John-1-1.html"&gt;John 1:1&lt;/a&gt;–3, Jesus was already alive as one with God before the creation of the world. The eternal Son of God has always been alive. Therefore, when Jesus was crucified and buried, His spirit was still alive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Promise of Eternal Life&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout His ministry, Jesus spoke about life beyond the physical world. He promised eternal life to those who believed in Him (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/3/John-3-16.html"&gt;John 3:16&lt;/a&gt;–18) and explained that His kingdom was not of this world (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/18/John-18-36.html"&gt;John 18:36&lt;/a&gt;). This concept of eternal life goes beyond our earthly existence and encompasses the spiritual realm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/skOJMUYhgQ8" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The Breath of Life and the Spirit&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When God created the first man, He breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, making him a living soul (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/2/Genesis-2-7.html"&gt;Genesis 2:7&lt;/a&gt;). This life came directly from God, who is eternal. Humans have a spirit that is meant to live forever, just as God will live forever. While our bodies may die, our spirits continue to exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Jesus' Death and Resurrection&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Jesus died on the cross, His body truly died and was buried, but His spirit remained alive. He committed His spirit into the Father's hands (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/23/Luke-23-46.html"&gt;Luke 23:46&lt;/a&gt;). On the third day, God raised Jesus from the dead, reuniting His spirit with a glorified body (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Philippians/3/Philippians-3-21.html"&gt;Philippians 3:21&lt;/a&gt;). Over five hundred people witnessed Jesus after His resurrection (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-Corinthians/15/1-Corinthians-15-6.html"&gt;1 Corinthians 15:6&lt;/a&gt;), and the New Testament was written by eyewitnesses who confirmed that Jesus was truly alive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Jesus' Ascension and Current State&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forty days after His resurrection, Jesus ascended bodily into heaven in the presence of His disciples (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Acts/1/Acts-1-9.html"&gt;Acts 1:9&lt;/a&gt;–11). He returned to the Father, as He had predicted (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/14/John-14-1.html"&gt;John 14:1&lt;/a&gt;–2; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/20/John-20-17.html"&gt;John 20:17&lt;/a&gt;). Today, Jesus is alive in heaven with God, the angels, and all those who have trusted in Him for salvation (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/2-Corinthians/5/2-Corinthians-5-8.html"&gt;2 Corinthians 5:8&lt;/a&gt;). He sits at the right hand of the Father (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Colossians/3/Colossians-3-1.html"&gt;Colossians 3:1&lt;/a&gt;) and intercedes for His followers on earth (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/7/Hebrews-7-25.html"&gt;Hebrews 7:25&lt;/a&gt;). Furthermore, Jesus has promised to return again (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/14/John-14-1.html"&gt;John 14:1&lt;/a&gt;–2).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Significance of Jesus' Resurrection&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The resurrection of Jesus holds immense significance for Christians. It confirms that Jesus is the Son of God and that His sacrifice on the cross was accepted by God. It also gives us hope for eternal life. Just as Jesus' spirit never died, our spirits will also live forever (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/11/John-11-25.html"&gt;John 11:25&lt;/a&gt;–26). How we respond to God's offer of salvation determines our destiny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The belief in Jesus' resurrection is foundational to Christianity. Without His resurrection, our faith would lose its power. The resurrection proves that sin and death have been conquered through Christ's sacrifice, offering forgiveness and eternal life to all who believe. It assures us that we serve a living Savior who continues to be actively involved in our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider the significance of Jesus' resurrection in your own life. How does the assurance of eternal life impact your faith? Reflect on the hope and joy that come from knowing that death is not the end but a doorway to everlasting life with God. Let the truth of Jesus' resurrection strengthen your faith and inspire you to share the good news with others.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Jesus Christ/The Identity of Jesus/Basics"></category><category term="null"></category></entry><entry><title>Did Jesus Exist?

&lt;p&gt;The existence of Jesus is a topic that has been debated and scrutinized by scholars and skeptics alike. Some people question whether Jesus was a real historical figure or simply a mythical character. In this article, we will explore the evidence for the existence of Jesus from both biblical and secular sources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The New Testament: A Reliable Source&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New Testament is often questioned as a reliable source for evidence of Jesus' existence. However, it contains numerous references to Jesus Christ, which cannot be dismissed outright. While some suggest that the Gospels were written in the second century AD, over 100 years after Jesus' death, this view is strongly disputed. Even if we were to accept this dating, it is essential to note that ancient writings from less than 200 years after the events are considered highly reliable evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the Epistles of Paul, which most scholars agree were written in the middle of the first century AD, less than 40 years after Jesus' death, provide significant evidence of Jesus' existence. These early writings offer compelling testimonies about Jesus and his teachings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Secular Historical Sources&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secular historical sources also provide valuable insights into the existence of Jesus. While these sources may not hold the same religious significance as biblical texts, they offer an external perspective on Jesus and his impact during his time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tacitus&lt;/strong&gt;: Tacitus was a first-century Roman historian considered to be one of the more accurate historians of the ancient world. He mentioned "Christians" who suffered under Pontius Pilate during the reign of Tiberius. This reference confirms the existence of Christ and the persecution faced by early Christians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Suetonius&lt;/strong&gt;: Suetonius, chief secretary to Emperor Hadrian, wrote about a man named Chrestus (or Christ) who lived during the first century AD. Although brief, this reference provides further confirmation of Jesus' existence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flavius Josephus&lt;/strong&gt;: Josephus, a renowned Jewish historian from the first century AD, referred to James, "the brother of Jesus, who was called Christ." In one disputed passage, he also described Jesus as a wise man who performed astonishing feats and appeared to his disciples after his crucifixion. While some scholars question the authenticity of this specific passage, it is noteworthy that Josephus mentioned Jesus in his writings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Julius Africanus&lt;/strong&gt;: Julius Africanus, a third-century Christian writer, quoted the historian Thallus regarding the darkness that followed Jesus' crucifixion. This reference provides an independent account of the events surrounding Jesus' death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pliny the Younger&lt;/strong&gt;: Pliny the Younger, a second-century Roman author, described early Christian worship practices and their belief in Jesus as God. He also mentioned their ethical conduct and observance of rituals like the love feast and Lord's Supper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Talmud&lt;/strong&gt;: The Talmud, a collection of Jewish texts, makes references to Jesus' crucifixion on the eve of Passover and accuses him of practicing sorcery and encouraging apostasy among Jews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SRfFLjWLybA" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lucian of Samosata&lt;/strong&gt;: Lucian, a second-century Greek writer, acknowledged that Jesus was worshipped by Christians, introduced new teachings, and was crucified for them. He described the beliefs and practices of Christians during that time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mara Bar-Serapion&lt;/strong&gt;: Mara Bar-Serapion, a first-century Syrian philosopher, wrote a letter mentioning Jesus as a wise and virtuous man who was considered the king of Israel. He noted that Jesus was put to death by the Jews but continued to live on through his followers' teachings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These secular sources provide external confirmation of Jesus' existence and shed light on how he was perceived during his time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The existence of Jesus is a fundamental aspect of Christian faith. Accepting the historical reality of Jesus lays the foundation for understanding his teachings, his sacrificial death on the cross, and his resurrection. It affirms the central beliefs of Christianity and the impact Jesus had on both his contemporaries and subsequent generations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Considering the evidence presented, it is important to reflect on the significance of Jesus' existence. The fact that multiple secular sources from different time periods mention Jesus underscores the historical validity of his life and ministry. It challenges us to question our own beliefs and consider the impact Jesus has had on human history. Whether you are a believer or skeptic, examining the evidence for Jesus' existence can lead to a deeper understanding of his teachings and their relevance in today's world.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Jesus Christ/The Identity of Jesus/Basics"></category><category term="null"></category></entry><entry><title>'Discovering the Truth: Who is Jesus Christ - Unveiling His Divine Identity'</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/who-is-jesus/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-05-24T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-05-24T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-05-24:/who-is-jesus/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Who is Jesus?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The identity of Jesus Christ is a topic of great significance in Christianity.

&lt;h3&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The identity of Jesus Christ is a topic of great significance in Christianity. While most people accept that Jesus was a historical figure who lived in Israel 2,000 years ago, the debate arises when discussing his full identity. The Bible presents Jesus as more than just a prophet, good teacher, or godly man. In fact, Jesus claimed to be God in the flesh. This article will explore the biblical evidence for Jesus' divinity and why it matters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Jesus Claimed to be God&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus' claim to be God is a central aspect of his identity. In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/10/John-10-30.html"&gt;John 10:30&lt;/a&gt;, Jesus said, "I and the Father are one." Although this statement may not immediately appear to be a claim of divinity, the Jews understood it as such and attempted to stone him for blasphemy. Jesus never sought to correct their understanding. In fact, in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/8/John-8-58.html"&gt;John 8:58&lt;/a&gt;, he proclaimed, "Before Abraham was born, I am!" Using the phrase "I am," Jesus applied a name for God (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Exodus/3/Exodus-3-14.html"&gt;Exodus 3:14&lt;/a&gt;) to himself. Again, the Jews reacted with anger and tried to stone him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/R9qoqQ75ifs" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The Witness of Scripture&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bible provides further evidence of Jesus' divinity. In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/1/John-1-1.html"&gt;John 1:1&lt;/a&gt;, it states that "the Word was God," and in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/1/John-1-14.html"&gt;John 1:14&lt;/a&gt;, it declares that "the Word became flesh." This refers to Jesus as the Word made flesh, emphasizing his divine nature taking on human form. Additionally, when Thomas encountered the resurrected Jesus, he exclaimed, "My Lord and my God" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/20/John-20-28.html"&gt;John 20:28&lt;/a&gt;). Jesus did not correct Thomas but affirmed his belief. The apostle Paul also referred to Jesus as "our great God and Savior" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Titus/2/Titus-2-13.html"&gt;Titus 2:13&lt;/a&gt;), and Peter called him "our God and Savior" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/2-Peter/1/2-Peter-1-1.html"&gt;2 Peter 1:1&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another significant testimony comes from God the Father himself. &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/1/Hebrews-1-8.html"&gt;Hebrews 1:8&lt;/a&gt; quotes &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/45/Psalm-45-6.html"&gt;Psalm 45:6&lt;/a&gt;, saying, "But about the Son, he says, 'Your throne, O God, will last forever and ever.'" This confirms Jesus' divine identity as the Son of God. Old Testament prophecies, such as &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/9/Isaiah-9-6.html"&gt;Isaiah 9:6&lt;/a&gt;, also point to Jesus' deity by describing him as the "Wonderful Counselor," "Mighty God," "Everlasting Father," and "Prince of Peace."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Jesus' Role as Mediator and Savior&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question of Jesus' identity as God is essential because it determines his role as the mediator between humanity and God. Jesus had to be both fully God and fully human to accomplish this. As God, Jesus could satisfy God's wrath for sin, and as a man, he had the capability to die on behalf of humanity. This unique combination makes him the perfect mediator (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-Timothy/2/1-Timothy-2-5.html"&gt;1 Timothy 2:5&lt;/a&gt;). In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/14/John-14-6.html"&gt;John 14:6&lt;/a&gt;, Jesus declared, "I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me." Salvation is only available through faith in Jesus Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding and accepting Jesus' divinity has significant implications for Christians. It affirms that salvation is found in Jesus alone. Believing in Jesus as God means recognizing his authority and submitting to his teachings. It also provides assurance of eternal life because only God himself could offer an infinite, eternally valuable sacrifice for our sins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider the significance of Jesus' claim to be God. If he is not truly divine, then he would either be a liar or a lunatic. However, if he is indeed who he claimed to be—the Son of God—then acknowledging his divinity demands a response from us. We must decide whether we will accept him as Lord and Savior or reject him altogether. This decision has eternal implications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, the biblical evidence supports Jesus' claim to be God in the flesh. The witness of Scripture, the reactions of the Jews, and the affirmations from Thomas, Paul, Peter, and God the Father all point to Jesus' divine identity. Understanding and accepting this truth is vital for salvation and a personal relationship with God. As Christians, we are called to recognize Jesus as our Lord and Savior—the way, the truth, and the life.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Jesus Christ/The Identity of Jesus/Basics"></category><category term="null"></category></entry><entry><title>'Ultimate Guide to Christology: Exploring the Divinity of Christ'</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/christology/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-05-05T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-05-05T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-05-05:/christology/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Christology&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Christology is the study of the Person and work of Jesus Christ, combining the Greek words meaning "Christ" and "word." It seeks to answer important questions about Jesus, such as who He is and whether He is God. Understanding Christology is crucial for our salvation and has a profound impact on our daily lives as believers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Who is Jesus Christ?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many religions acknowledge Jesus as a prophet, teacher, or godly man, but the Bible reveals that He is much more than that. Jesus never explicitly said, "I am God," but His statements leave no room for any other interpretation. The Bible presents Jesus as both fully human and fully divine, with no mixture or dilution of either nature. He is one united Person forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Hypostatic Union&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the central concepts in Christology is the hypostatic union, which explains how Jesus can be both God and man simultaneously. The Bible teaches that Jesus is fully human and fully divine without any confusion or change in His nature. This union allows Him to be the perfect sacrifice for our sins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Importance of the Virgin Birth&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The virgin birth is a crucial biblical doctrine because it accounts for the absence of the transmission of the sin nature and enables the eternal God to become a perfect man. Jesus was conceived by the Holy Spirit and born to Mary, bypassing the natural means of procreation. This miraculous birth ensures that Jesus is fully human while being free from original sin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Jesus as the Son of God&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we refer to Jesus as the Son of God, it does not imply a father-son relationship in the traditional sense. Instead, it signifies that Jesus is God made manifest in human form. He is the ultimate revelation of God's nature and character. Recognizing Jesus as the Son of God is essential for understanding His role in our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Significance of Christology&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christology is a crucial area of theology because it helps us understand the deity of Christ and His work of atonement. It teaches us that Jesus had to be both fully human and fully God to accomplish our redemption. Without a proper understanding of who Jesus is and what He accomplished, our understanding of other theological concepts will be flawed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding Christology is essential for our faith. It informs us about the nature and identity of Jesus Christ, which affects our relationship with Him. Recognizing Jesus as both fully human and fully divine allows us to appreciate the depth of His love for us. It also helps us grasp the significance of His sacrifice on the cross for our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Think About It&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take a moment to reflect on the significance of Jesus being fully human and fully divine. How does this impact your understanding of His love for you? How does it deepen your appreciation for what He accomplished on the cross? Consider how this understanding can transform your relationship with Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Names and Titles of Christ&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Scriptures provide various names and titles for Jesus, revealing different aspects of His character and how He relates to us as believers. Some of these include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Good Shepherd&lt;/strong&gt;: Jesus is depicted as our shepherd, leading, protecting, and caring for us like a shepherd cares for his sheep (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/10/John-10-11.html"&gt;John 10:11&lt;/a&gt;, 14). He knows each one of us intimately and guides us through life's challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Light of the World&lt;/strong&gt;: Jesus is described as the Light that illuminates our path in a dark and uncertain world (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/8/John-8-12.html"&gt;John 8:12&lt;/a&gt;). He brings clarity, truth, and guidance to our lives, dispelling darkness and confusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prince of Peace&lt;/strong&gt;: As the Prince of Peace (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/9/Isaiah-9-6.html"&gt;Isaiah 9:6&lt;/a&gt;), Jesus brings tranquility into our tumultuous lives. He offers true peace that surpasses all understanding, calming our hearts amidst chaos and turmoil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our Rock&lt;/strong&gt;: Jesus is likened to a rock (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-Corinthians/10/1-Corinthians-10-4.html"&gt;1 Corinthians 10:4&lt;/a&gt;), providing stability, security, and safety. Just as a rock is immovable, Jesus is steadfast and trustworthy, ensuring our firm foundation in Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the names and titles of Christ helps us develop a deeper relationship with Him. These descriptions reveal His character and how He relates to us personally. Knowing that Jesus is our shepherd, our light, our source of peace, and our rock brings comfort, guidance, and security in our daily lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider how these names and titles of Christ relate to your own experiences. In what ways has Jesus been your shepherd, guiding you through difficult times? How has He been a light in the darkness, bringing clarity and truth into your life? Reflect on how knowing Jesus as the Prince of Peace has brought peace to your heart in challenging circumstances. Meditate on how Jesus being your rock has provided stability and security in times of uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, Christology is the study of the Person and work of Jesus Christ. It explores important questions about His identity as both fully human and fully divine. Understanding Christology is crucial for our salvation and has a profound impact on our daily lives as believers. Recognizing Jesus as the Son of God and understanding His various names and titles deepens our relationship with Him and helps us experience His love, guidance, peace, and stability in our lives.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Jesus Christ/The Identity of Jesus/Basics"></category><category term="null"></category></entry><entry><title>Is Jesus Real?

&lt;p&gt;Jesus is a real person and one of the most significant figures in history. Scholars, both Christian and secular, overwhelmingly agree that there was a historical Jesus. The evidence supporting his existence is substantial and comes from various sources. Ancient historians such as Josephus and Tacitus wrote about Jesus, providing historical documentation. Furthermore, the Old Testament predicted the coming of the Messiah, who would be a real person delivering Israel. These prophecies were fulfilled by Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5Xwc_E_q3oQ" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The New Testament contains numerous references to Jesus Christ as a real person. The earliest gospel was likely written within 10 years of Jesus' death, and Paul's epistles were written approximately 25 years after his death. This is important because it means that there were still eyewitnesses alive who could verify the truth of the gospel accounts. Additionally, there is overwhelming manuscript evidence for the authenticity of the New Testament, with around 25,000 early manuscripts in existence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outside of the Bible, Jesus is mentioned in other religious texts such as the Quran, as well as in the writings of Judaism, Gnosticism, and Hinduism. Early historians like Tacitus and Flavius Josephus also referred to Jesus. The impact Jesus has had on the world is unparalleled, with the Western dating system being measured from his birth. Countless charitable organizations have been founded in his name, and millions of people can testify to his work in their lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding that Jesus is a real historical figure is essential for Christians as it affirms their faith and provides a foundation for belief. It shows that Christianity is not based on a fictional story but on the life and teachings of a real person who made a significant impact on human history. Recognizing Jesus' existence helps believers to have confidence in their relationship with him and to share their faith with others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider the implications if Jesus did not exist or if he was merely a fictional character. The entire Christian faith would be built on falsehood, and the impact he has had on the world would be based on a lie. It is essential to examine the evidence and consider the historical and religious accounts that attest to Jesus' existence. Ultimately, faith in Jesus as a real person requires trust in the historical records and the testimony of those who have experienced his transformative power.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Jesus Christ/The Identity of Jesus/Basics"></category><category term="null"></category></entry><entry><title>'Discover Jesus in Every Book of the Bible: A Comprehensive Christian Journey'</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/jesus-in-every-book-of-the-bible/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-04-17T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-04-17T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-04-17:/jesus-in-every-book-of-the-bible/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Jesus in Every Book of the Bible&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Bible is God's Word to us, revealing who God is, what He has done, and how we are to live. In this article, we will explore how Jesus is present in every book of the Bible. Jesus is the theme of the Bible, and everything in it ultimately points to Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Jesus in the Old Testament&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although Jesus did not come to earth until a specific point in history, He is integral in both the Old and New Testaments. In the Old Testament, we see our need for a Savior and the predictions of His coming, which sets the stage for His entrance into the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Genesis, Jesus is seen as the Word of God, through whom all things were created. He is also referred to as the promised Seed of the woman, pointing to His future coming as a human being (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/3/Genesis-3-15.html"&gt;Genesis 3:15&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Exodus, Jesus is represented by the Passover lamb. Just as the blood of the lamb protected the Israelites from God's judgment, so Jesus' sacrifice on the cross protects us from sin and death.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Deuteronomy, Jesus is described as a prophet greater than Moses. Moses himself prophesied that God would raise up a prophet like him (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Deuteronomy/18/Deuteronomy-18-15.html"&gt;Deuteronomy 18:15&lt;/a&gt;), and Jesus perfectly fulfills this prophecy.&lt;/p&gt;

He is called the Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, and Prince of Peace (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/9/Isaiah-9-6.html"&gt;Isaiah 9:6&lt;/a&gt;). He is also depicted as the Suffering Servant who was wounded for our transgressions and bruised for our iniquities (Isaiah 53).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Obadiah, Jesus is the judge of all the earth and mighty to save. He will bring justice and deliverance to His people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Jonah, Jesus is the salvation of all lands. The story of Jonah foreshadows Jesus' mission to bring salvation not only to the Jewish people but also to the Gentiles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Micah, Jesus is depicted as the prophet cast out in the storm who spent three days in the depths. This points to Jesus' death and resurrection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Habakkuk, Jesus is the avenger of God's elect. He brings justice and judgment upon the wicked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Zephaniah, Jesus is the reason for rejoicing and our strength even when fields are empty. He is our source of joy and strength in times of difficulty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, recognizing Jesus in every book of the Bible enhances our study and interpretation of Scripture. It reminds us to read the Bible with Christ-centered lenses, seeking to understand how each passage points to Him. This approach helps us avoid misinterpretation and ensures a consistent, Christ-centered understanding of Scripture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Think About It&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you read and study the Bible, consider how each book reveals Jesus. How does recognizing Jesus in every book enhance your understanding of God's plan of redemption?

&lt;p&gt;To understand …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Jesus and Speaking in Tongues&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The topic of Jesus speaking in tongues is an intriguing one, often discussed within Christian circles. However, when we examine the biblical evidence, we find no indication that Jesus actually spoke in tongues. Let's explore this further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Gift of Speaking in Tongues&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To understand the discussion around Jesus speaking in tongues, it is important to first understand the gift of speaking in tongues as described in the Bible. According to &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-Corinthians/14/1-Corinthians-14-6.html"&gt;1 Corinthians 14:6&lt;/a&gt;, speaking in tongues occurs when someone speaks a language they do not know in order to edify someone who does speak that language. It is a supernatural form of speech that enables communication between individuals who speak different languages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;No Evidence of Jesus Speaking in Tongues&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Jesus were to speak in tongues, it would have made sense for Him to do so at His baptism when the Holy Spirit descended upon Him like a dove (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/1/Mark-1-10.html"&gt;Mark 1:10&lt;/a&gt;). However, the Bible does not record Jesus speaking in tongues on this or any other occasion. While some advocates of today's tongues movement assume that Jesus did speak in tongues, there is no scriptural evidence to support this claim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Misinterpretations and Sighs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9fXTqADUWr0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Advocates for Jesus speaking in tongues often point to passages such as &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/7/Mark-7-34.html"&gt;Mark 7:34&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/8/Mark-8-12.html"&gt;Mark 8:12&lt;/a&gt; as evidence. In these verses, it is mentioned that Jesus looked up to heaven with a deep sigh and sighed deeply in His spirit. However, it is important to note that a sigh is not the same as the supernatural gift of tongues. Anyone can sigh for various reasons, but it does not prove the presence of the Holy Spirit's power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Languages Spoken by Jesus&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We do have evidence from the Bible that Jesus spoke Aramaic, which was the most common language spoken in Israel during His time (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/5/Mark-5-41.html"&gt;Mark 5:41&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Acts/26/Acts-26-14.html"&gt;Acts 26:14&lt;/a&gt;). Additionally, it is likely that Jesus was also conversant in Hebrew and Greek, as these languages were used in the region. However, whether or not Jesus spoke with supernatural power in another language, the Bible does not provide any explicit information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question of whether Jesus spoke in tongues may seem insignificant to some, but it has implications for our understanding of His divine nature and purpose. By examining the biblical evidence, we can have a clearer understanding of the gifts and abilities that Jesus possessed during His earthly ministry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Christians, it is essential to base our beliefs and interpretations on what the Bible explicitly states. While there are various opinions and theories about Jesus speaking in tongues, we must rely on the scriptural evidence available to us. By doing so, we ensure that our faith is grounded in truth and aligns with the teachings of the Bible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, there is no evidence in the Bible to support the claim that Jesus spoke in tongues. The gift of speaking in tongues is described as speaking a language one does not know in order to communicate with someone who speaks that language. While Jesus spoke Aramaic and likely knew Hebrew and Greek, there is no record of Him speaking with supernatural power in another language. It is important for us as Christians to rely on biblical evidence when forming our beliefs and interpretations.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Jesus Christ/The Person of Jesus/Jesus’ Religion"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Did Jesus Drink Wine? Exploring Biblical Perspectives on Alcohol Consumption</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/did-jesus-drink-wine/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-08-30T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-08-30T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-08-30:/did-jesus-drink-wine/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Did Jesus Drink Wine?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this article, we will explore the question of whether Jesus drank wine. We will examine various biblical passages and historical context to provide a comprehensive understanding of this topic. It is important to note that this article maintains a Biblical, young-earth, conservative Christian perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Jesus' …&lt;/h3&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Did Jesus Drink Wine?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this article, we will explore the question of whether Jesus drank wine. We will examine various biblical passages and historical context to provide a comprehensive understanding of this topic. It is important to note that this article maintains a Biblical, young-earth, conservative Christian perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Jesus' First Miracle: Turning Water into Wine&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One significant event that sheds light on Jesus' stance towards wine is His first miracle, which took place at the wedding in Cana (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/2/John-2-1.html"&gt;John 2:1-11&lt;/a&gt;). During the celebration, when the wine ran out, Jesus miraculously turned water into wine. According to Jewish wedding traditions of that time, fermented wine was always served at weddings. In fact, the master of the feast commented that Jesus' wine was better than what was previously served (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/2/John-2-10.html"&gt;John 2:10-11&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is worth noting that the Greek word used to describe the state of those who drank Jesus' wine suggests intoxication. This same word is used in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Acts/2/Acts-2-15.html"&gt;Acts 2:15&lt;/a&gt;, where Peter defends the apostles against accusations of drunkenness. Therefore, it appears that the wine Jesus produced had the capacity to intoxicate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Jesus and Wine in Cultural Context&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While turning water into wine does not directly prove that Jesus drank it Himself, it would have been normal for Him to do so. In fact, &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/7/Luke-7-33.html"&gt;Luke 7:33-34&lt;/a&gt; highlights an incident where Jesus contrasts His own practices with John the Baptist's abstinence from wine. The religious leaders falsely accused Jesus of being a drunkard. However, it is important to remember that Jesus lived a completely sinless life (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-Peter/2/1-Peter-2-22.html"&gt;1 Peter 2:22&lt;/a&gt;) and was never a drunkard or glutton.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aCoc16iwutg" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We must also consider the Passover celebration, which commonly included fermented wine. The Scriptures use the term "fruit of the vine" when referring to the wine consumed during this feast (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/26/Matthew-26-27.html"&gt;Matthew 26:27-29&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/14/Mark-14-23.html"&gt;Mark 14:23-25&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/22/Luke-22-17.html"&gt;Luke 22:17-18&lt;/a&gt;). Jesus actively participated in drinking from the Passover cup (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/14/Mark-14-23.html"&gt;Mark 14:23&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Wine in Biblical Context&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is essential to view wine in its biblical context. While all Christians agree that drunkenness is sinful, wine itself is not inherently sinful. In fact, the Bible presents wine as something to delight in (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/104/Psalm-104-14.html"&gt;Psalm 104:14-15&lt;/a&gt;). However, there are numerous warnings against alcohol abuse because sinful individuals are more likely to misuse wine than to use it in moderation (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Proverbs/20/Proverbs-20-1.html"&gt;Proverbs 20:1&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is crucial to understand that Jesus' probable use of wine should not be an excuse for drunkenness or excessive consumption. Jesus Himself warns against drunkenness (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/12/Luke-12-45.html"&gt;Luke 12:45&lt;/a&gt;). Therefore, Christians who choose to drink wine should either do so in moderation, never to the point of drunkenness, or abstain entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding whether Jesus drank wine has implications for how Christians approach alcohol today. By examining the biblical evidence, we can gain insight into the proper use and moderation of wine. It allows us to discern between the misuse of alcohol and its responsible consumption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does knowing that Jesus turned water into wine at the wedding in Cana impact your view on the consumption of alcohol?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What does it mean for Christians to drink in moderation and avoid drunkenness?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can understanding Jesus' actions regarding wine help us navigate societal pressures and temptations related to alcohol?&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scripture records several instances of Jesus interacting with children, demonstrating His love and value for them. These interactions serve as important lessons on faith and humility. In this article, we will explore these accounts and the significance they hold for us today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Jesus and Children&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scripture records several instances of Jesus interacting with children, demonstrating His love and value for them. These interactions serve as important lessons on faith and humility. In this article, we will explore these accounts and the significance they hold for us today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Jesus Welcomes Children&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One well-known account of Jesus interacting with children is found in Mark 10. People were bringing little children to Jesus for Him to bless them, but the disciples tried to prevent it. However, Jesus rebuked them, saying, "Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/10/Mark-10-14.html"&gt;Mark 10:14&lt;/a&gt;). Jesus not only welcomes the children into His presence but also blesses each one individually. This highlights the importance Jesus places on children and their role in God's kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Jesus' welcoming attitude towards children teaches us the importance of valuing and embracing children in our communities. Their innocence and trust serve as a reminder of the kind of faith we should have when approaching God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; How can we ensure that our churches and communities are inclusive and welcoming to children? What steps can we take to prioritize their spiritual growth?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Healing and Restoration&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bible also records instances where parents brought their ailing children to Jesus for healing. For example, in John 4, a royal official approached Jesus seeking healing for his son who was close to death. Jesus responded by saying, "Go, your son will live" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/4/John-4-50.html"&gt;John 4:50&lt;/a&gt;), and the official's son was healed. Similarly, Jesus cast out demons from a young girl in Mark 7 and from a boy in Mark 9. These miracles demonstrate Jesus' compassion for children and His power to bring healing and restoration to their lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; The healing miracles performed by Jesus reveal His authority over sickness and the spiritual realm. They also show us that Jesus cares deeply about the well-being of children and desires to bring wholeness to their lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; How can we pray for the physical and spiritual healing of children in our communities? How can we support families who are facing health challenges with their children?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Raising the Dead&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Luke 8, we read the account of Jairus, a synagogue leader, who came to Jesus seeking help for his dying daughter. While on their way to Jairus' house, messengers arrived with the news that the girl had died. However, Jesus told Jairus not to be afraid and proceeded to raise the girl back to life. This miraculous event demonstrates Jesus' power over death and His ability to bring hope and restoration even in the most desperate situations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; The resurrection of Jairus' daughter reveals Jesus' authority over death itself. It reminds us that no situation is beyond His reach and that He can bring new life to seemingly hopeless circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/n6n-ALc-S5c" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; How does the resurrection of Jairus' daughter give us hope in difficult times? How can we trust in Jesus' ability to bring life and restoration to seemingly dead situations?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Childlike Faith&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout His ministry, Jesus often used children as examples of the type of faith adults should have. In Mark 10, after blessing the children, Jesus told His disciples, "Truly I tell you, anyone who will not receive the kingdom of God like a little child will never enter it" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/10/Mark-10-15.html"&gt;Mark 10:15&lt;/a&gt;). In another instance, when the disciples were arguing about greatness in God's kingdom, Jesus brought a child forward and said, "Truly I tell you, unless you change and become like little children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/18/Matthew-18-3.html"&gt;Matthew 18:3&lt;/a&gt;). According to Jesus, humility and simple acceptance, qualities often found in children, are essential for receiving the kingdom of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Jesus calls us to possess a childlike faith, characterized by humility, trust, and a willingness to depend on God. This type of faith allows us to receive God's gift of salvation without pretention or hypocrisy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; How can we cultivate childlike faith in our own lives? What aspects of our faith do we need to simplify and approach with greater humility?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Our Heavenly Father's Provision&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Children often rely on their parents for their daily needs, trusting that they will provide for them. In the same way, we are called to humbly depend on our Heavenly Father for provision in both the spiritual and physical realms. Just as children approach their parents with simplicity and trust, we should approach God with the same attitude.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Recognizing our dependence on God and His provision helps us develop a deeper relationship with Him and strengthens our faith. It reminds us that God is our ultimate provider and sustainer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; In what areas of your life do you struggle to depend on God's provision? How can you cultivate a deeper trust in God's ability to provide for your needs?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The accounts of Jesus interacting with children demonstrate His love, compassion, and desire for each person to have a childlike faith. We are called to value and embrace children in our communities, pray for their healing and restoration, and learn from their simplicity and trust. May we strive to cultivate a childlike faith that leads us into a deeper relationship with our Heavenly Father.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The famous children’s hymn "Jesus Loves the Little Children" holds a significant place in Christian worship. This hymn, written by C. Herbert Woolston and composed by George F. Root, conveys a powerful message about Jesus' love for all children. The lyrics are simple yet profound, stating that Jesus loves children of all races and backgrounds because they are precious in His sight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Jesus' Love for Children in the Bible&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept of Jesus loving children is supported by various passages in the Bible. These accounts illustrate how Jesus valued and showed love to children during His time on earth. One well-known story is found in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/10/Mark-10-13.html"&gt;Mark 10:13&lt;/a&gt;–14, 16, where people brought little children to Jesus for Him to bless them. Although the disciples initially rebuked them, Jesus became indignant and said, "Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these." He then took the children in His arms, placed His hands on them, and blessed them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, Jesus performed miracles to heal and restore children's lives. In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/4/John-4-46.html"&gt;John 4:46&lt;/a&gt;–52, He healed a nobleman's son from a distance. There are also instances where Jesus cast out demons from children (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/7/Mark-7-24.html"&gt;Mark 7:24&lt;/a&gt;–30; 9:14–27), showcasing His power and compassion for their well-being. Additionally, Jesus raised at least one child from the dead (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/8/Luke-8-40.html"&gt;Luke 8:40&lt;/a&gt;–56), demonstrating His authority over life and death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Humility of Children&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus taught that we should have the humility of children. In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/18/Matthew-18-2.html"&gt;Matthew 18:2&lt;/a&gt;–4, He called a little child to Him and said, "Truly I tell you, unless you change and become like little children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven. Therefore, whoever takes the lowly position of this child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven." In this passage, Jesus emphasizes the importance of humility and childlike faith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does it mean to have the humility of a child? It means having a faith devoid of ambition, pride, and haughtiness. Children are naturally teachable and have a humble trust in their parents. Similarly, we are called to approach our relationship with God with the same teachable spirit and trust in His guidance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GP8_c0UxmdQ" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding Jesus' love for children is essential for several reasons. Firstly, it reminds us that every child is precious in God's sight, regardless of their background or ethnicity. This truth challenges us to treat children with love, care, and respect, following the example set by Jesus Himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, recognizing Jesus' interactions with children helps us understand His character and heart. He valued children and took the time to bless them individually. This reveals the depth of His love and compassion for all people, especially those who are vulnerable and dependent like children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, Jesus' teaching on having the humility of a child has broader implications for our faith. It calls us to approach God with a childlike trust and openness to learn from Him. Embracing humility allows us to grow spiritually and develop a deeper relationship with our Heavenly Father.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reflecting on Jesus' love for children can lead us to ask ourselves important questions. How do we demonstrate love and care for children in our communities? Are there ways we can actively support and uplift children who may be marginalized or in need? Additionally, how can we cultivate childlike humility in our own lives? What steps can we take to approach God with trust, teachability, and a willingness to learn from Him?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As followers of Christ, it is crucial that we not only acknowledge Jesus' love for children but also embody that love through our actions. By doing so, we can make a positive impact on the lives of children, reflecting the love and compassion of Jesus to the world around us.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Jesus Christ/The Person of Jesus/Jesus’ Friendships"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Was Jesus Wealthy?

&lt;p&gt;Throughout Christian theology, Jesus is considered to be as rich as God Himself, being the second person of the Trinity. He possesses all power, authority, sovereignty, glory, honor, and majesty. However, during His time on Earth, Jesus willingly gave up His eternal riches and most of the …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Was Jesus Rich?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout Christian theology, Jesus is considered to be as rich as God Himself, being the second person of the Trinity. He possesses all power, authority, sovereignty, glory, honor, and majesty. However, during His time on Earth, Jesus willingly gave up His eternal riches and most of the privileges of His deity. He took on the nature of a lowly and humble servant, becoming poor for our sake. By the time Jesus endured the tortures of the cross, His earthly possessions amounted to no more than the clothes on His back that were divided up by the soldiers who crucified Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to note that there are some prosperity preachers today who claim that Jesus was rich during His time on Earth and that God desires to bless His children with material abundance. However, this belief is not supported by biblical truth. A closer examination of the Bible reveals that Jesus and His disciples depended entirely on the hospitality of others as they ministered from town to town. Jesus Himself stated that while foxes have holes and birds have nests, He had no place to lay His head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This false teaching about Jesus' wealth and the idea of a "gospel of greed" has unfortunately gained traction in some churches today. The apostle Paul warned about those who cause divisions and put obstacles in the way of true teaching. He cautioned against those who serve their own appetites rather than serving the Lord Christ by deceiving naive individuals with smooth talk and flattery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus consistently taught about the dangers of pursuing earthly wealth. He warned that those who seek riches fall into temptation and harmful desires that can lead to ruin and destruction. The love of money is identified as a root of all kinds of evil, causing some people to wander from their faith and experience many griefs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New Testament contains numerous teachings where Jesus admonishes the rich and praises the poor. He emphasized that life does not consist in the abundance of possessions and encouraged His followers to store up treasures in heaven rather than on Earth. Jesus recognized the deceitfulness of riches and how wealth can be a stumbling block to entering the kingdom of heaven.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the true nature of Jesus' earthly wealth is important for several reasons. Firstly, it helps us align our beliefs with biblical truth, guarding against false teachings and distorted interpretations of Scripture. Secondly, it reminds us of the sacrificial nature of Christ's ministry and His willingness to give up His riches for our sake. This should inspire gratitude and humility in our own lives. Lastly, it serves as a reminder that our focus should not be on accumulating earthly wealth but on seeking spiritual treasures and storing up treasures in heaven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How does the teaching that Jesus was rich during His time on Earth align with biblical principles?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How does Jesus' example of willingly giving up His riches challenge our own attitudes towards material possessions?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In what ways can pursuing earthly wealth become a stumbling block to our faith?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How does understanding Jesus' poverty during His earthly ministry shape our perspective on the prosperity gospel?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reflect on your own priorities and values regarding wealth and possessions. Are they aligned with Jesus' teachings?&lt;/p&gt;

Exploring His True Identity</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/was-jesus-black/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-08-16T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-08-16T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-08-16:/was-jesus-black/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Was Jesus Black?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question of whether Jesus was black is a topic that has sparked debate among different groups, particularly those associated with the "Black Hebrew" movement. Some argue vehemently that Jesus was black or of African descent in terms of his skin color and appearance. However, it is …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Was Jesus Black?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question of whether Jesus was black is a topic that has sparked debate among different groups, particularly those associated with the "Black Hebrew" movement. Some argue vehemently that Jesus was black or of African descent in terms of his skin color and appearance. However, it is important to note that the Bible clearly declares Jesus' Jewishness, suggesting that he likely had light to dark brown skin. Nonetheless, the discussion about Jesus' skin color misses a crucial point: does it truly matter what color Jesus' skin was? Ultimately, the Bible provides little, if any, description of Jesus' physical appearance, indicating that his skin color is not a significant aspect of his identity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jLWvxUBsRGk" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The prophet Isaiah provides the most detailed description of Jesus' physical appearance in the Bible. He states, "He grew up before him like a tender shoot, and like a root out of dry ground. He had no beauty or majesty to attract us to him, nothing in his appearance that we should desire him" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/53/Isaiah-53-2.html"&gt;Isaiah 53:2&lt;/a&gt;). This verse suggests that Jesus did not possess any outstanding physical attributes or exceptional beauty that would draw attention or desire from others. If Jesus' skin color and complexion were important, God would have provided more information about them in Scripture. Therefore, speculating on the color of Jesus' skin is futile and can lead to unproductive quarrels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Ephesians/1/Ephesians-1-7.html"&gt;Ephesians 1:7&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Colossians/1/Colossians-1-14.html"&gt;Colossians 1:14&lt;/a&gt;, we learn that the color of Jesus' skin is irrelevant in the grand scheme of redemption. These verses emphasize the importance of Christ's sacrifice for our salvation, rather than focusing on his physical appearance. Instead of fixating on Jesus' external features, we are called to focus on his divine power and strive for a life of godliness and moral excellence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the Bible teaches us that God does not show favoritism based on race or nationality. In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Acts/10/Acts-10-34.html"&gt;Acts 10:34-35&lt;/a&gt;, Peter declares that God accepts people from every nation who fear Him and do what is right. This means that there are no cultural or racial barriers in Christianity, and we are all united in Christ Jesus. &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Galatians/3/Galatians-3-28.html"&gt;Galatians 3:28&lt;/a&gt; reiterates this message by stating, "There is neither Jew nor Greek, slave nor free, male nor female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus." The color of our Savior's skin should not affect our ability to share the gospel with others, and it should not hinder our relationships with people of different races or ethnicities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The apostles of the first-century church adapted to different cultures when spreading the gospel, but they never compromised their fidelity to the teachings of Christ (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-Corinthians/9/1-Corinthians-9-19.html"&gt;1 Corinthians 9:19-23&lt;/a&gt;). The method of teaching may have changed depending on the audience, but the message remained consistent. The gospel of Christ reaches the hearts of those who seek to know God, regardless of their race or skin color.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, while there are debates about Jesus' skin color, the Bible does not provide a clear answer. It is important to remember that Jesus' physical appearance is not a significant aspect of his identity or the message of the gospel. Rather than focusing on external features, we should center our attention on the redemptive work of Christ and strive for a life of godliness and moral excellence. Ultimately, salvation is found in Jesus alone, regardless of the color of his skin or the skin color of those we encounter in our mission to share the gospel.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Jesus Christ/The Person of Jesus/Jesus’ Appearance"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Why Jesus Fasted: Revealing the Spiritual Power Behind His Actions</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/why-did-jesus-fast/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-08-12T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-08-12T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-08-12:/why-did-jesus-fast/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Why Did Jesus Fast?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fasting is an important spiritual practice that has been observed by believers throughout history. In the Bible, we find numerous instances where people fasted to seek God's guidance, express repentance, or deepen their relationship with Him. Jesus himself engaged in fasting at various points during His earthly ministry. But why did Jesus fast? What was the significance of this practice for Him? In this article, we will explore six key reasons behind Jesus' decision to fast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1. Preparation for Ministry&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the primary reasons Jesus fasted was to prepare Himself for His public ministry. Before He began His three years of teaching, healing, and proclaiming the Kingdom of God, Jesus spent forty days and nights in the wilderness, engaged in a period of intense fasting and prayer. This time of solitude and self-denial allowed Him to focus solely on His mission and align Himself with the Father's will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During this period, Jesus faced various temptations from Satan but remained steadfast in His commitment to God. His fasting served as a way to strengthen His resolve, deepen His reliance on God's power, and overcome the temptations that would distract Him from fulfilling His purpose. By entering into this season of fasting, Jesus demonstrated the importance of spiritual preparation before embarking on significant tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; As believers, we can learn from Jesus' example of preparation through fasting. Before stepping into new seasons or endeavors, it is essential to seek God's guidance and align ourselves with His plans through prayer and self-denial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; How can you incorporate fasting as a means of preparation in your own life? What areas do you need to seek God's guidance and strength for?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2. Identification with Humanity&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another crucial reason behind Jesus' decision to fast was to identify with humanity's experiences and struggles. In becoming fully human while remaining fully divine, Jesus chose to undergo the same physical and emotional challenges we face. Fasting was one way for Him to enter into the human experience of hunger and weakness, allowing Him to relate to our needs and limitations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During His forty-day fast in the wilderness, Jesus experienced hunger and physical weakness. By willingly subjecting Himself to these hardships, He demonstrated His solidarity with humanity. This identification with our weaknesses further emphasizes His role as the compassionate Savior who understands our struggles and is able to help us in our times of need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Jesus' decision to fast shows us that He not only sympathizes with our weaknesses but also understands them experientially. We can take comfort in knowing that we serve a Savior who can empathize with our struggles and provide the strength we need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; How does Jesus' identification with our struggles through fasting impact your understanding of His love and compassion for you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;3. Spiritual Discipline&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fasting is a spiritual discipline that involves voluntarily abstaining from food or certain types of food for a specific period. It is a practice that helps believers cultivate self-control, discipline, and a deeper dependence on God. Jesus engaged in fasting as a means of spiritual discipline throughout His ministry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/4/Matthew-4-2.html"&gt;Matthew 4:2&lt;/a&gt;, we read that Jesus went without food for forty days and nights. This extended period of fasting required immense discipline and reliance on God's sustenance. By practicing this spiritual discipline, Jesus modeled for us the importance of self-control and the cultivation of spiritual habits that draw us closer to God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Fasting as a spiritual discipline helps us develop self-control and deepen our reliance on God's provision. It serves as a means to grow in our relationship with Him and become more attuned to His leading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; How can incorporating fasting into your spiritual life help you develop self-control and deepen your dependence on God?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;4. Intensified Prayer&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fasting and prayer often go hand in hand. Throughout the Bible, we see individuals fasting as a way to seek God's guidance and express their earnestness in prayer. Jesus understood the power of combining fasting with prayer and frequently engaged in both simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/17/Matthew-17-21.html"&gt;Matthew 17:21&lt;/a&gt;, Jesus talks about a particular kind of demon that can only be driven out through prayer and fasting. This verse highlights the effectiveness of fasting as a way to intensify our prayers and seek God's intervention in challenging situations. By fasting, Jesus demonstrated the importance of seeking God's guidance and intervention through focused and committed prayer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Fasting can serve as a catalyst for deepening our prayer life and seeking God's intervention more fervently. It can help us align our hearts with His purposes and experience breakthroughs in our spiritual journey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; How can incorporating fasting into your prayer life help you deepen your communion with God and experience greater breakthroughs?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KuDqMBWxcYY" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;5. Spiritual Warfare&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another significant reason for Jesus' decision to fast was to engage in spiritual warfare. Fasting is an act of self-denial that weakens our physical bodies but strengthens our spirits. It helps us focus on the spiritual realm and engage in battle against spiritual forces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/9/Mark-9-29.html"&gt;Mark 9:29&lt;/a&gt;, Jesus encountered a man possessed by an unclean spirit that His disciples were unable to cast out. Jesus explained that this type of spirit could only be driven out by prayer and fasting. By engaging in fasting, Jesus exhibited His authority over the spiritual realm and demonstrated the effectiveness of fasting as a weapon in spiritual warfare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Fasting can be a powerful tool in our spiritual battle against the enemy. It allows us to tap into God's strength and authority, enabling us to overcome the forces of darkness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; In what areas of your life do you need to engage in spiritual warfare? How can fasting be a means of seeking victory in those areas?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;6. Seeking God's Will&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, Jesus fasted as a way to seek God's will and direction. In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/4/Luke-4-1.html"&gt;Luke 4:1-2&lt;/a&gt;, we find that Jesus was led by the Holy Spirit into the wilderness, where He fasted for forty days and nights. This period of fasting allowed Him to focus on God's voice and discern His plan for His ministry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By fasting, Jesus demonstrated the importance of seeking God's will above all else. It enabled Him to align His desires with the Father's purposes and to stay on the path God had set before Him. Fasting served as a means for Jesus to cultivate sensitivity to God's leading and to ensure that His actions were in line with the Father's heart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Fasting can help us seek God's will and align our desires with His purposes. It allows us to tune our hearts to His voice and discern His guidance more clearly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; How can incorporating fasting into your life help you seek God's will and align your desires with His purposes?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus' decision to fast during His earthly ministry was multi-faceted. It served as a means of preparation, identification with humanity, spiritual discipline, intensified prayer, engagement in spiritual warfare, and seeking God's will. By understanding these reasons, we can appreciate the significance of fasting in our own lives as we seek to follow in the footsteps of our Savior. Let us embrace fasting as a spiritual practice that draws us closer to God and enables us to fulfill His purposes for our lives.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Jesus Christ/The Person of Jesus/Jesus’ Religion"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>How Tall Was Jesus? Unveiling the Physical Stature of Our Savior</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/how-tall-was-jesus/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-08-05T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-08-05T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-08-05:/how-tall-was-jesus/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;How Tall Was Jesus?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The height of Jesus is a topic that has intrigued many people, but the Bible does not provide any specific information about his height. In fact, the Bible rarely mentions the heights of individuals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite this lack of detail, the question of &amp;quot;How tall was Jesus …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;How Tall Was Jesus?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The height of Jesus is a topic that has intrigued many people, but the Bible does not provide any specific information about his height. In fact, the Bible rarely mentions the heights of individuals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite this lack of detail, the question of &amp;quot;How tall was Jesus?&amp;quot; continues to capture the interest of Bible scholars and scientists alike. They have delved into historical, cultural, and archaeological research to piece together what might be known about Jesus' physical appearance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The absence of direct measurement in biblical texts, such as cubits or centimeters, has not deterred scholars from exploring this curiosity, illustrating the broader intrigue surrounding the physical attributes of significant historical figures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only people in the Bible who are described in terms of their height are Saul, Goliath, and Zacchaeus. When it comes to Jesus, the Bible only provides a single physical description in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/53/Isaiah-53-2.html"&gt;Isaiah 53:2&lt;/a&gt;, which states, "He had no beauty or majesty to attract us to him, nothing in his appearance that we should desire him." This suggests that Jesus had an ordinary appearance, with no outstanding physical features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Average Height in First-Century Israel&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To speculate about Jesus' height, we can look at the average height of first-century Jewish males living in Israel. Anthropologists believe that the average height for a Jewish male during that time was around 5'1&amp;quot; (155 cm). This is significantly shorter than the average height of men today, which ranges between 5'5&amp;quot; (165 cm) and 5'11&amp;quot; (181 cm) depending on geographical location. It is important to note that these are estimates based on skeletal remains and other evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scholars and scientists have further refined these estimates, suggesting that Jesus' height likely ranged from 5'1&amp;quot; to 5'5&amp;quot;. This range is based on the average heights for men during the 1st century, supported by both archaeological data and historical context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such estimates provide a fascinating glimpse into the physical characteristics of people from that era, offering a tangible connection to the past. While these figures are speculative, they are grounded in scientific research and historical analysis, providing us with a reasonable approximation of Jesus' stature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joan Taylor, in her 2018 publication, delved into various sources to form an educated estimate of Jesus' physical characteristics. Her research utilized archaeological findings, historical documentation, and ancient Egyptian funerary artwork. Through these means, she concluded that, similar to many individuals from Judea and Egypt during that era, Jesus likely had brown eyes, dark hair ranging from brown to black, and skin with an olive-brown tone.
To estimate Jesus’ height, Taylor examined skeletal remains typical of the area during that period. She deduced that he probably stood around 5 feet 5 inches (approximately 166 cm), which aligned with the average male height at the time. This approach helped her piece together a more grounded and realistic image of what Jesus might have looked like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Shroud of Turin&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people have attempted to determine Jesus' height by examining the Shroud of Turin, which is believed by some to be Jesus' burial cloth. The image on the shroud portrays a man who appears to be around 6'1" (185 cm) tall. However, there are two main issues with using the Shroud of Turin as evidence. First, it is highly unlikely that the shroud is actually Jesus' burial cloth. Second, if Jesus were indeed 6'1" tall, he would have been significantly taller than most people in Israel at that time. This contradicts the description in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/53/Isaiah-53-2.html"&gt;Isaiah 53:2&lt;/a&gt;, which portrays Jesus as having an ordinary appearance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Perfect Genetics and Height&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another theory suggests that Jesus, being sinless, would have had perfect genetics, which could have resulted in a taller stature. However, this theory overlooks the fact that Scripture never indicates that Jesus was genetically perfect. Furthermore, other factors such as nutrition and environment play a significant role in determining height. Again, the description in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/53/Isaiah-53-2.html"&gt;Isaiah 53:2&lt;/a&gt; implies that Jesus' appearance was ordinary, so it is unlikely that he stood out in terms of height.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Significance of Height&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2001, Richard Neave, a retired medical artist, collaborated with a team of Israeli and British forensic experts and computer programmers to create a new depiction of Jesus. They based their work on a 1st-century Israeli skull and utilized advanced computer modeling, alongside knowledge about the appearance of Jewish people from that time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings suggest a portrayal of Jesus that is quite distinct from traditional artistic interpretations. This image features a man approximately five feet tall, with darker skin, brown eyes, and shorter, curlier hair. While it's not an exact replication, many scholars consider it a more accurate representation of Jesus' likely appearance than previous depictions throughout history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2kI2mLAqAAw" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the exact height of Jesus is not significant when it comes to his ministry, death, and resurrection. While our society tends to associate height with superiority or attractiveness, these physical traits are not what truly matter. In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-Samuel/16/1-Samuel-16-7.html"&gt;1 Samuel 16:7&lt;/a&gt;, it is stated, "The LORD does not look at the things people look at. People look at the outward appearance, but the LORD looks at the heart." God's choice often goes beyond physical attributes and focuses on the heart and character of an individual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;How tall was Goliath as described in 1 Samuel?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1 Samuel, Goliath's height is detailed as six cubits and a span, which translates to over nine feet tall. This biblical description paints Goliath as a towering figure, emphasizing his gigantic stature in the narrative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;How is King Saul described in the Old Testament in terms of height?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Old Testament, King Saul is portrayed as exceptionally tall. The scripture highlights his unique stature, noting that he stood over a head taller than anyone else in all of Israel. His impressive height was a distinguishing characteristic, setting him apart from his peers physically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;What does the Gospel of Luke say about Zacchaeus' height?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Gospel of Luke, it's noted that Zacchaeus was unable to see Jesus because of the crowd, as he was notably short in stature. This physical characteristic compelled him to climb a sycamore tree to get a glimpse of Jesus above the gathering of people. His determination highlights both his eagerness and the practical challenge his height presented in that bustling setting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The height of Jesus may seem like a trivial topic, but it raises important questions about how we perceive others and what we value in them. We tend to associate physical height with superiority or attractiveness, but this mindset is not aligned with God's perspective. The Bible teaches us to look beyond outward appearances and focus on the heart and character of individuals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider why we are often inclined to view tall people as more desirable or superior. Reflect on how this societal bias affects our perception of others and influences our behavior. Take a moment to challenge these assumptions and remind yourself that true value lies in character and the heart rather than physical attributes.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Jesus Christ/The Person of Jesus/Jesus’ Appearance"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Discover the Divine Nature of Jesus: A Christian Insight</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/what-was-jesus-like/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-07-28T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-07-28T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-07-28:/what-was-jesus-like/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;What Was Jesus Like?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus, the central figure of Christianity, possessed a unique and remarkable character that drew people to Him. Despite not having physical attractiveness, it was His personality that captivated others. Let's explore the key aspects of Jesus' character and how we can seek to emulate His example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Compassionate and Caring&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus was known for His deep compassion. He saw the crowds and felt deep empathy for them, describing them as "harassed and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/9/Matthew-9-36.html"&gt;Matthew 9:36&lt;/a&gt;). This compassion led Him to heal their diseases (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/14/Matthew-14-14.html"&gt;Matthew 14:14&lt;/a&gt;; 20:34) and miraculously provide food for large crowds (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/14/Matthew-14-13.html"&gt;Matthew 14:13&lt;/a&gt;–21; 15:29–39). Jesus' compassionate nature reminds us to care for those in need and offer practical help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Jesus' compassion challenges us to recognize the suffering of those around us and respond with love and kindness. By following Jesus' example, we can make a positive impact on others' lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; How can you show compassion to those around you? Are there practical ways you can extend a helping hand to those in need?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Serious and Focused&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus had a clear mission in life and remained focused on it. He understood the importance of His purpose and the limited time He had on Earth. Jesus approached His mission with a servant's heart, declaring that He "did not come to be served, but to serve" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/10/Mark-10-45.html"&gt;Mark 10:45&lt;/a&gt;). His humility, kindness, and selflessness characterized His entire personality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Jesus' focus on serving others challenges us to prioritize selflessness in our own lives. By seeking opportunities to serve and help others, we can fulfill our purpose just as Jesus did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; How can you align your life with Jesus' mission of serving others? In what ways can you prioritize selflessness in your daily interactions?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Submission to God's Will&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus demonstrated a profound submission to His Father's will. He understood that the only acceptable payment for our salvation was His sacrifice on the cross. In the face of immense suffering, Jesus prayed, "My Father, if it is possible, may this cup be taken from me. Yet not as I will, but as you will" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/26/Matthew-26-39.html"&gt;Matthew 26:39&lt;/a&gt;). Even as a child, Jesus was obedient to His earthly parents, Mary and Joseph (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/2/Luke-2-51.html"&gt;Luke 2:51&lt;/a&gt;). His obedience extended to His heavenly Father as well, learning obedience through suffering (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/5/Hebrews-5-8.html"&gt;Hebrews 5:8&lt;/a&gt;) and resisting temptations without sinning (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/4/Hebrews-4-15.html"&gt;Hebrews 4:15&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Jesus' submission to God's will challenges us to surrender our own desires and align them with God's purpose for our lives. By submitting to God, we can experience growth and transformation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; How can you cultivate a heart of submission to God's will in your daily life? Are there areas where you struggle to surrender your desires to Him?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Merciful and Forgiving&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus possessed a heart full of mercy and forgiveness. Even while suffering on the cross, He prayed for forgiveness for those who crucified Him, saying, "Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/23/Luke-23-34.html"&gt;Luke 23:34&lt;/a&gt;). Jesus' love extended to His close relationships as well. &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/11/John-11-5.html"&gt;John 11:5&lt;/a&gt; tells us that He loved Martha, her sister Mary, and their brother Lazarus. The Gospel of John also refers to John himself as "the disciple whom Jesus loved" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/13/John-13-23.html"&gt;John 13:23&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Jesus' mercy and forgiveness challenge us to extend grace to others and cultivate a forgiving heart. By imitating Jesus' love and forgiveness, we can bring healing and restoration to broken relationships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; Are there individuals in your life who need your forgiveness? How can you extend mercy and forgiveness to those who have wronged you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Truthful and Peaceable&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus consistently spoke the truth and lived a life of integrity. He never violated His own word and was known for His honesty. Jesus declared, "I am the way and the truth and the life" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/14/John-14-6.html"&gt;John 14:6&lt;/a&gt;). At the same time, He exhibited peaceable qualities, avoiding arguments and coercion as He shared His message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Jesus' commitment to truth challenges us to value honesty and integrity in our own lives. By living truthfully and peacefully, we reflect Jesus' character to those around us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; How can you prioritize truthfulness and honesty in your interactions with others? In what ways can you promote peace instead of engaging in arguments or disputes?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Intimate Relationships&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wapXZkU-jFM" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus valued intimate relationships. He invested quality time with His followers, teaching them and guiding them towards eternal truths. Jesus also maintained an intimate relationship with His heavenly Father through regular prayer, obedience, and a deep concern for God's reputation. When Jesus witnessed people exploiting worshipers in the temple, He drove them out, upholding the sanctity of God's house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Jesus' emphasis on intimate relationships challenges us to prioritize meaningful connections with others. By investing time in nurturing relationships and seeking intimacy with God, we can experience spiritual growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; How can you cultivate deeper relationships with those around you? In what ways can you prioritize intimacy with God through prayer and obedience?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Strong yet Meek Leader&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus displayed both strength and meekness in His leadership style. People were drawn to Him wherever He went because of His authority and the way He communicated (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/1/Mark-1-27.html"&gt;Mark 1:27&lt;/a&gt;–28; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/7/Matthew-7-28.html"&gt;Matthew 7:28&lt;/a&gt;–29). His followers marveled at His teachings. Jesus' patient and understanding nature was evident as He endured provocation and remained steadfast in His mission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Jesus' leadership example challenges us to lead with strength, humility, and patience. By emulating Jesus' leadership qualities, we can positively influence those around us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; How can you lead with strength, humility, and patience in your various roles and relationships? Are there areas where you need to grow as a leader?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Patience and Understanding&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus consistently displayed patience, even when faced with faithless provocations. He patiently addressed doubts and questions, providing reassurance and understanding. Throughout the Gospels, Jesus expressed His patience towards His disciples and others (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/8/Matthew-8-26.html"&gt;Matthew 8:26&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/9/Mark-9-19.html"&gt;Mark 9:19&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/14/John-14-9.html"&gt;John 14:9&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/2-Peter/3/2-Peter-3-9.html"&gt;2 Peter 3:9&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Jesus' patience challenges us to extend grace and understanding to others, especially during challenging times. By cultivating patience, we can reflect Jesus' character in our interactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; In what situations do you struggle to exercise patience? How can you cultivate a patient attitude towards others?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Emulating Jesus' Character&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As believers, we are called to emulate Jesus' character traits through the power of the Holy Spirit. When we strive to reflect Jesus' compassion, servanthood, submission to God's will, mercy, honesty, truthfulness, intimacy in relationships, strong yet meek leadership, and patience, we become a powerful witness for Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Emulating Jesus' character enables us to impact the world around us positively. By embodying these traits, we can draw others closer to God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt; Reflect on the character traits of Jesus discussed in this article. Which of these traits do you want to develop further in your own life? How can you actively pursue growth in these areas?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, Jesus' character was marked by compassion, focus, submission, mercy, truthfulness, and much more. His example challenges us to live a life that reflects His character, inspiring others to draw closer to God. By seeking to emulate Jesus' character traits through the power of the Holy Spirit, we can bring glory to God and impact the world around us.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Jesus Christ/The Person of Jesus/Jesus’ Character"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Unveiling the Sinless Savior: Jesus'' Impeccable Nature Revealed</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/jesus-sinless/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-07-27T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-07-27T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-07-27:/jesus-sinless/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Jesus: The Sinless Savior&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout Scripture, it is evident that Jesus was sinless. His sinlessness is of great significance because it is through His perfect sacrifice that we have hope of eternal life in heaven. Let us explore this truth and understand its implications for our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Inherited Sin …&lt;/h3&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Jesus: The Sinless Savior&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout Scripture, it is evident that Jesus was sinless. His sinlessness is of great significance because it is through His perfect sacrifice that we have hope of eternal life in heaven. Let us explore this truth and understand its implications for our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Inherited Sin Nature&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The entrance of sin into the world can be traced back to Adam and Eve's disobedience in the Garden of Eden (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/3/Genesis-3-6.html"&gt;Genesis 3:6&lt;/a&gt;). As a result, sin became a part of human nature, and we are all born with a sinful inclination (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/5/Romans-5-12.html"&gt;Romans 5:12&lt;/a&gt;–19). This sinful nature separates us from God and leads to physical and eternal death (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/6/Romans-6-23.html"&gt;Romans 6:23&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Sinless Savior&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite being fully human, Jesus Christ lived a life without sin. He experienced temptation in every way, just as we do, yet never succumbed to it (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/4/Hebrews-4-15.html"&gt;Hebrews 4:15&lt;/a&gt;). The apostle Peter affirmed this truth when he said, "He committed no sin and no deceit was found in His mouth" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-Peter/2/1-Peter-2-22.html"&gt;1 Peter 2:22&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is essential to recognize that Jesus Christ is not only fully human but also fully God. As the Son of God, He possesses a divine nature that is incapable of sinning. This divine aspect of His being ensures His sinlessness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Need for Forgiveness&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our sinful nature creates a barrier between us and our Creator. In order to be reconciled with God, forgiveness is necessary. However, forgiveness requires the shedding of blood (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/9/Hebrews-9-22.html"&gt;Hebrews 9:22&lt;/a&gt;). While animal sacrifices in the Old Testament temporarily covered sins, they could never completely remove them (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/10/Hebrews-10-4.html"&gt;Hebrews 10:4&lt;/a&gt;, 11).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These animal sacrifices were a foreshadowing of the perfect and ultimate sacrifice that Jesus Christ would make. Without sin in His own life, Jesus was able to offer Himself as the perfect sacrifice for the forgiveness of sins. This sacrificial act on the cross at Calvary paid the full penalty for the sins of all who believe in Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Perfect Sacrifice&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oqUu3-FatsE" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus' sinless nature and sacrificial death provided the means for our reconciliation with God. Just as sin entered the world through one man, Adam, God was able to redeem the world through one man—the sinless Jesus Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shedding of Jesus' blood on the cross was a necessary requirement for forgiveness. This sacrifice, made once for all, superseded the temporary animal sacrifices of the Old Testament (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/7/Hebrews-7-27.html"&gt;Hebrews 7:27&lt;/a&gt;; 10:10). By offering Himself as a spotless Lamb without blemish or defect, Jesus became our redeemer (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-Peter/1/1-Peter-1-18.html"&gt;1 Peter 1:18&lt;/a&gt;–19).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the sinlessness of Jesus is crucial for our faith. It confirms His divine nature and establishes His credibility as our Savior. If Jesus had sinned, He would not have been a suitable sacrifice for our sins, and we would be left without hope. However, because Jesus lived a sinless life, His death on the cross provided the way for our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recognizing and embracing Jesus' sinlessness also invites us to examine our own lives. We are called to follow His example and strive to live lives that are free from sin, even though we may fall short at times. Jesus' sinlessness serves as an inspiration and encouragement for us to pursue holiness in our daily lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus' sinlessness poses a challenge for us to consider. If Jesus was able to resist temptation and live a sinless life, what does that say about our own ability to overcome sin? While we may stumble and fall, we can take comfort in knowing that Jesus understands our struggles and offers us forgiveness and grace when we repent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we reflect on the sinlessness of Jesus, let us be reminded of the incredible love and sacrifice He made on our behalf. Jesus' sinless nature qualifies Him as the perfect Savior, offering us forgiveness and the opportunity for eternal life. May we respond to His grace with gratitude and strive to emulate His example in our own lives.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Jesus Christ/The Person of Jesus/Jesus’ Character"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Was Jesus White?

&lt;h3&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The portrayal of Jesus as having white skin and light hair is common in Western art. However, it is important to note that the Bible does not provide a physical description of Jesus. The Bible does not mention Jesus' height, weight, skin color, hair color, or …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Was Jesus White?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The portrayal of Jesus as having white skin and light hair is common in Western art. However, it is important to note that the Bible does not provide a physical description of Jesus. The Bible does not mention Jesus' height, weight, skin color, hair color, or eye color. Such details are not essential to understanding who Jesus is. While there is no definitive answer to what Jesus looked like, we can make reasonable assumptions based on historical and geographical context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Jesus' Ethnicity and Appearance&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus was a Jew, also known as a Hebrew or Israelite. He lived in the Middle East and was of Semitic descent. Therefore, it is likely that he had light- to medium-brown skin, brown eyes, and dark-brown to black hair. Although lighter skin tones can be found among Middle Easterners, they are relatively rare in that region. Thus, it is safe to say that Jesus was not white.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Portrayals of Jesus in Art&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When examining portrayals of Jesus from different cultures around the world, we find that artists often depict Him in a way that resembles people from their own culture. Europeans tend to portray Jesus as European, Africans as African, and Asians as Asian. This tendency arises from people's inclination to imagine Jesus looking somewhat like themselves or those they are familiar with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dfJCyDmTwyg" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it is not inherently wrong to imagine Jesus looking a certain way, we must be cautious not to let our preferred image of Him become an idol. The Bible emphasizes that Jesus is the Savior for all nations, transcending skin color or ethnicity. Regardless of our physical appearance, we can all experience forgiveness of sin and reconciliation with God through the crucified and risen Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The absence of a physical description of Jesus in the Bible serves as a reminder against arrogance and presumption regarding His appearance. It is crucial to recognize that what Jesus looked like is ultimately unimportant. His physical appearance has no bearing on His role as the Savior of the world. The love of Jesus goes beyond external characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does imagining Jesus looking like us or those we are familiar with affect our perception of Him?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why is it important not to let our preferred image of Jesus become an idol?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does recognizing Jesus as the Savior for all nations impact our understanding of His love and salvation?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, while the Bible does not provide a physical description of Jesus, it is reasonable to assume that He had light- to medium-brown skin, brown eyes, and dark-brown to black hair due to His Jewish heritage and Middle Eastern context. The portrayal of Jesus as white in Western art is a result of cultural influences and people's inclination to envision Him resembling themselves or those they are familiar with. However, Jesus' physical appearance is ultimately inconsequential to His role as the Savior of the world. His love and salvation transcend skin color and ethnicity, offering forgiveness and reconciliation to all who believe in Him.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Jesus Christ/The Person of Jesus/Jesus’ Appearance"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Jesus the Ultimate Pacifist: Embracing Nonviolence in Christian Faith</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/jesus-pacifist/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-06-28T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-06-28T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-06-28:/jesus-pacifist/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Jesus as a Non-Violent Figure&lt;/h2&gt;

However, it is important to note that the Bible also acknowledges that there are times …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Jesus as a Non-Violent Figure&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus is often described as a pacifist, someone who opposes violence and war for any purpose. His message during His time on Earth emphasized non-violence and love for one's enemies. However, it is important to note that the Bible also acknowledges that there are times when war may be necessary. So, while Jesus can be seen as a figure of peace, it is not accurate to label Him solely as a pacifist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Jesus' Non-Violent Message&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Bible, Jesus teaches His followers to turn the other cheek and to love their enemies (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/5/Matthew-5-38.html"&gt;Matthew 5:38&lt;/a&gt;–44). These teachings emphasize forgiveness and non-retaliation. Jesus encourages His disciples to pursue peaceful resolutions and to respond to hostility with kindness and compassion. His non-violent approach is evident in His interactions with people, including the Roman centurion whom He commended for his faith (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/8/Matthew-8-5.html"&gt;Matthew 8:5&lt;/a&gt;–13). Jesus did not tell the centurion to leave the army, indicating that He was not advocating for pacifism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Instances of Violence in Prophecy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Jesus' earthly ministry focused on non-violence, the Bible also contains prophecies that depict Him engaging in violence. In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Revelation/19/Revelation-19-15.html"&gt;Revelation 19:15&lt;/a&gt;, it is written that Jesus will come with a sharp sword to strike down nations and rule them with an iron scepter. This imagery suggests a future war against the forces of evil. Additionally, &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Revelation/19/Revelation-19-13.html"&gt;Revelation 19:13&lt;/a&gt; mentions that Jesus' robe will be "dipped in blood," further alluding to a violent conflict. These prophecies indicate that there will be a time when violence becomes necessary in establishing Jesus' millennial kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Disciples and Weapons&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contrary to the idea that Jesus was a pacifist, His disciples were recorded as owning weapons. On the night of His betrayal, Jesus instructed His followers to bring swords, and they had two (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/22/Luke-22-37.html"&gt;Luke 22:37&lt;/a&gt;–39). Jesus did not condemn their ownership of weapons but rather cautioned against their misuse. When Peter attempted to use his sword during Jesus' arrest, Jesus healed the injured man and told Peter to put away his weapon (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/18/John-18-10.html"&gt;John 18:10-11&lt;/a&gt;). This interaction suggests that Jesus acknowledged the presence of weapons among His disciples but did not endorse violence as a means to achieve His mission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Balance of Life's Activities&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book of Ecclesiastes presents a balanced view of life's activities, including times for killing, tearing down, war, and peace (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Ecclesiastes/3/Ecclesiastes-3-1.html"&gt;Ecclesiastes 3:1&lt;/a&gt;, 3, 8). These verses demonstrate that there are moments when conflict and even war are appropriate responses to certain situations. They emphasize that being a follower of Jesus does not require pacifism but rather calls for standing against evil and pursuing righteousness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Conflict in Pursuit of Truth&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus Himself stated that He came not to bring peace but a sword (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/10/Matthew-10-34.html"&gt;Matthew 10:34&lt;/a&gt;–36). This statement does not advocate for warfare but rather highlights the potential conflict that arises when truth confronts opposing ideologies. Jesus openly challenged the religious and political leaders of His time because they were not seeking God's righteousness (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/13/Luke-13-31.html"&gt;Luke 13:31&lt;/a&gt;–32; 19:45–47). His willingness to engage in conflict when necessary shows that He prioritized truth over maintaining peace at any cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_kMYx3Eunmg" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;God's Role in Warfare&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout the Old Testament, there are numerous instances where God used His people in warfare to bring judgment upon nations whose sin had reached its full measure. For example, before the battle of Jericho, Joshua encountered "the commander of the army of the Lord," who held a drawn sword (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Joshua/5/Joshua-5-13.html"&gt;Joshua 5:13-14&lt;/a&gt;). This figure is believed to be the pre-incarnate Christ. These accounts demonstrate that God is not a pacifist and intervenes in human affairs when necessary to execute justice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding Jesus' stance on violence is crucial for Christians as they navigate moral and ethical dilemmas related to war and conflict. While Jesus taught non-violence and love for enemies, the Bible also acknowledges that there are times when war may be justified. This recognition helps Christians discern when it is appropriate to engage in warfare in defense of justice and the protection of innocent lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Think About It&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does Jesus' emphasis on non-violence impact your understanding of conflict resolution and forgiveness in your own life?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In what situations do you think it is justifiable for Christians to participate in warfare? How can you reconcile this with Jesus' teachings?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reflect on the balance between pursuing peace and standing against evil in the world. How can you actively promote peace while also opposing injustice and oppression?&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus, the central figure of Christianity, was born into a Jewish family and grew up in a Jewish community that followed the Jewish law. His lineage can be traced back to the tribe of Judah, one of the twelve tribes of Israel. The town of Bethlehem was his birthplace, and he was raised in Nazareth. Therefore, it is safe to say that Jesus was deeply immersed in Jewish culture, nationality, and religion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Practice of Judaism&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During his time on earth, Jesus practiced the religion of first-century Judaism. He was "born under the law" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Galatians/4/Galatians-4-4.html"&gt;Galatians 4:4&lt;/a&gt;) and adhered to the teachings of the Torah. He not only obeyed the Mosaic Law but also fulfilled it, bringing its requirements to a close (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/5/Matthew-5-17.html"&gt;Matthew 5:17&lt;/a&gt;–18; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/10/Romans-10-4.html"&gt;Romans 10:4&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Observance of Feasts and Festivals&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus and his disciples observed various Jewish feasts and festivals. For example, they celebrated the Passover (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/2/John-2-13.html"&gt;John 2:13&lt;/a&gt;, 23; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/22/Luke-22-7.html"&gt;Luke 22:7&lt;/a&gt;–8) and the Feast of Tabernacles (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/7/John-7-2.html"&gt;John 7:2&lt;/a&gt;, 10). In addition, there are references to Jesus attending an unnamed Jewish feast in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/5/John-5-1.html"&gt;John 5:1&lt;/a&gt;. This demonstrates his participation in Jewish religious traditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Synagogue Attendance and Teaching&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus regularly attended worship services and taught in synagogues (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/1/Mark-1-21.html"&gt;Mark 1:21&lt;/a&gt;; 3:1; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/6/John-6-59.html"&gt;John 6:59&lt;/a&gt;; 18:20). His presence in these settings highlights his involvement in Jewish religious life. Furthermore, he respected the scribes and Pharisees who taught the Law as it was understood during his time (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/23/Matthew-23-1.html"&gt;Matthew 23:1&lt;/a&gt;–3).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Knowledge of Scriptures&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ITEzXLcpKZs" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus frequently quoted from the Tanakh (the Hebrew Bible) during his teachings (e.g., &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/12/Mark-12-28.html"&gt;Mark 12:28&lt;/a&gt;–31; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/4/Luke-4-4.html"&gt;Luke 4:4&lt;/a&gt;, 8, 12). This demonstrates his familiarity with and reliance on Jewish scriptures. Jesus upheld the importance of these sacred texts and incorporated their teachings into his own messages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Jesus and His Religion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to note that Jesus did not deviate from the religious observances of Judaism. When addressing a group of Jews, he challenged them by asking, "Can any of you prove me guilty of sin?" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/8/John-8-46.html"&gt;John 8:46&lt;/a&gt;). If Jesus had departed from the religious practices of Judaism, his adversaries would have undoubtedly used this as an opportunity to condemn him. However, throughout his life, Jesus consistently adhered to Jewish customs and traditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Condemnation of Religious Leaders&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Jesus criticized the religious leaders of his day, it is crucial to understand that his condemnation was not directed at the Jewish religion itself. Instead, he condemned those who taught man-made ideas as commands from God (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/15/Matthew-15-9.html"&gt;Matthew 15:9&lt;/a&gt;, NLT). Jesus sought to purify Judaism by challenging corrupt practices and hypocrisy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The Fulfillment of the Law&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus' purpose was not to destroy Judaism but to fulfill it. He perfectly followed the Law and brought it to completion. His death marked the end of the Old Covenant God had made with Israel, as symbolized by the tearing of the temple veil (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/15/Mark-15-38.html"&gt;Mark 15:38&lt;/a&gt;), and established the New Covenant (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/22/Luke-22-20.html"&gt;Luke 22:20&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Early Church and Judaism&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The early Christian church had its roots in Judaism and Jewish messianism. The earliest followers of Christ were predominantly Jewish. However, as they proclaimed Jesus as the long-awaited Messiah, many Jews rejected this message. Consequently, the early believers were forced to separate themselves from mainstream Judaism (see &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Acts/13/Acts-13-45.html"&gt;Acts 13:45&lt;/a&gt;–47).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding that Jesus was raised in and practiced first-century Judaism provides important context for interpreting his teachings and actions. It highlights the continuity between Jewish religious traditions and the emergence of Christianity. Recognizing Jesus' Jewish background can deepen our appreciation for his fulfillment of the Law and the significance of his sacrificial death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does knowing that Jesus practiced Judaism inform your understanding of his teachings?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How might Jesus' Jewish background affect your perspective on the relationship between Christianity and Judaism?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In what ways can Jesus' observance of Jewish customs and traditions inspire Christians to appreciate their own religious heritage?&lt;/li&gt;

We will examine various passages from the Bible to understand the context and draw conclusions based on biblical teachings.

&lt;h3&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this article, we will explore the question of whether Jesus ate meat. We will examine various passages from the Bible to understand the context and draw conclusions based on biblical teachings. It is important to note that throughout this discussion, we will maintain a biblical, young-earth, conservative Christian perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Permission to Eat Meat&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/9/Genesis-9-3.html"&gt;Genesis 9:3&lt;/a&gt; is the first mention of eating meat in the Bible. After the Flood, God told Noah, “Everything that lives and moves about will be food for you. Just as I gave you the green plants, I now give you everything.” This verse clearly indicates that God granted permission to eat meat after the Flood. The Old Testament also provides numerous instances where meat eating was considered normal and acceptable. For example, the Passover lamb (Exodus 12) and the provision of quail in the wilderness (Exodus 16) were both instances where meat was consumed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oicQeehbvJ0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Daniel's Vegetarian Diet&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some may argue that Daniel and his three friends' decision to eat only vegetables in Babylon (Daniel 1) suggests a vegetarian lifestyle. However, it is important to understand the context of their situation. Daniel and his friends were captives in a foreign land, and there was no guarantee that the meat they were offered would have been considered clean according to the Mosaic law. Therefore, their choice to stick to a vegetable diet was likely due to concerns about following the dietary laws rather than a rejection of meat eating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Jesus' Consumption of Fish&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus' own actions provide evidence that He ate meat. In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/24/Luke-24-41.html"&gt;Luke 24:41&lt;/a&gt;–43, Jesus ate fish. He also served fish to His followers (Matthew 14), and on two occasions, He even caused fishermen's nets to be filled with fish (Luke 5 and John 21). The purpose of catching these fish was for sale and consumption. Additionally, Jesus cooked fish for His disciples (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/21/John-21-9.html"&gt;John 21:9&lt;/a&gt;). These instances clearly indicate that Jesus was not opposed to eating meat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Feast of Passover&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another strong piece of evidence comes from Jesus' observance of the annual Feast of Passover. The lamb sacrificed at Passover time was roasted and eaten as part of the requirements of the law (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Exodus/12/Exodus-12-8.html"&gt;Exodus 12:8&lt;/a&gt;). Jesus took part in the feast every year as a child (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/2/Luke-2-41.html"&gt;Luke 2:41&lt;/a&gt;), and as an adult, He continued to observe the law. Jesus attended Passover in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/2/John-2-13.html"&gt;John 2:13&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/5/John-5-1.html"&gt;John 5:1&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/26/Matthew-26-17.html"&gt;Matthew 26:17&lt;/a&gt;–30. It is important to note that if Jesus had not eaten the Passover meal, He would have been in disobedience to the Law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Jesus' Teaching on Clean and Unclean Foods&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark tells us that Jesus declared all foods to be clean (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/7/Mark-7-19.html"&gt;Mark 7:19&lt;/a&gt;). This declaration was made in the context of a discussion about ceremonial washing of hands. The distinction between clean and unclean foods in the Mosaic law was related to animals, not plants. When Jesus declared all foods clean, it meant that more animals were now allowed for consumption. This teaching from Jesus aligns with Paul's later statements in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/14/Romans-14-2.html"&gt;Romans 14:2&lt;/a&gt;–3 and verse 14. These verses emphasize that no food is unclean in itself and that individual dietary choices should not lead to judgment or condemnation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Misconceptions About Jesus' Vegetarianism&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent years, some groups have claimed that Jesus was a vegetarian based on their interpretation of His teachings on kindness and compassion. They argue that modern methods of raising and slaughtering animals are inherently cruel, and therefore, abstaining from meat should be practiced. However, it is important to note that the humane treatment of animals is a separate issue from whether or not Jesus ate meat. There is no biblical evidence to support the claim that Jesus advocated for vegetarianism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding whether Jesus ate meat has implications for how we interpret and apply biblical teachings. It helps us understand the cultural and historical context in which Jesus lived and how He interacted with the dietary practices of His time. It also provides insight into the significance of the Passover meal and its fulfillment in Jesus' life and ministry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reflecting on this topic can lead to deeper contemplation of our own dietary choices and how they align with biblical principles. It is important to approach discussions on diet with respect for differing convictions and to prioritize unity within the body of Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, based on biblical evidence, it is clear that Jesus did eat meat. Multiple passages support this conclusion, including God's permission to eat meat after the Flood, Jesus' consumption of fish, His observance of the Feast of Passover, and His teaching that all foods are clean. While there may be debates about dietary choices today, it is important to understand the biblical context and teachings regarding meat eating.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Jesus Christ/The Person of Jesus/Jesus’ Character"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Could Jesus Have Sinned?

&lt;h3&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question of whether Jesus could have sinned is a topic of interest and debate among Christians. While both sides agree that Jesus did not sin, the disagreement arises regarding whether He could have sinned. This article will explore two perspectives: "impeccability" (believing Jesus could not have sinned) and "peccability" (believing Jesus could have sinned but did not). By examining biblical teachings, we can gain a better understanding of this theological question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Impeccability: Jesus Could Not Have Sinned&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the doctrine of impeccability, Jesus could not have sinned. Supporters of this view argue that if Jesus could have sinned, He would still be capable of sinning today because He retains the same divine essence He had while living on earth. As the God-Man, Jesus remains fully divine and fully human, inseparably united in one person. To believe that Jesus could sin would imply that God Himself could sin, which goes against His nature (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Colossians/1/Colossians-1-19.html"&gt;Colossians 1:19&lt;/a&gt;, 2:9).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus, although fully human, was not born with the sinful nature that we inherit. He faced temptations from Satan but remained sinless because sin is contrary to God's nature (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/4/Matthew-4-1.html"&gt;Matthew 4:1&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/2/Hebrews-2-18.html"&gt;Hebrews 2:18&lt;/a&gt;, 4:15; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/James/1/James-1-13.html"&gt;James 1:13&lt;/a&gt;). Temptation itself is not sinful; it becomes sinful when someone dwells upon a sinful act and considers participating in it. Jesus experienced temptation in a way that aligns with the first definition - suggestions of sinful acts were presented to Him, but He had no inner desire to participate in them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Peccability: Jesus Could Have Sinned But Did Not&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those who hold to peccability believe that Jesus could have sinned but chose not to. They argue that if Jesus could not have sinned, He could not genuinely empathize with our struggles and temptations against sin. However, it's important to note that experiencing something is not a prerequisite for understanding it. God, being all-knowing, comprehends every aspect of sin and temptation. Jesus can empathize with our temptations without having personally experienced each one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus faced temptations in the same three categories that are common to all humans: the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-John/2/1-John-2-16.html"&gt;1 John 2:16&lt;/a&gt;). We see this pattern in the temptations faced by Eve in the Garden of Eden and Jesus in the wilderness. Despite being tempted in every way, Jesus remained perfectly holy. As believers, we too can overcome sin through Christ, no longer being slaves to sin but slaves of God (Romans 6).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MgzlgR3t8kI" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding whether Jesus could have sinned or not has theological implications. The belief in Jesus' impeccability highlights His divine nature and reinforces the idea that God is incapable of sinning. It affirms His sinless sacrifice on the cross as the perfect atonement for humanity's sins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, acknowledging that Jesus could have sinned but chose not to emphasizes His identification with humanity. It demonstrates His ability to empathize with our struggles and temptations, ultimately providing comfort and encouragement for believers facing their own battles against sin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reflecting on this question can deepen our understanding of who Jesus is and how He relates to us. Consider the following questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does Jesus' impeccability affirm His divine nature?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In what ways does recognizing Jesus' ability to empathize with our temptations encourage you in your own struggles against sin?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does Jesus' victory over temptation give you hope in overcoming your own temptations?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By pondering these questions and studying Scripture, we can grow in our understanding of Jesus' nature and the significance of His sinlessness.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Jesus Christ/The Person of Jesus/Jesus’ Character"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>7 Surprising Instances of Jesus Showing Anger: Revealing His Humanity and Divinity</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/jesus-angry/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-06-09T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-06-09T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-06-09:/jesus-angry/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Jesus and His Anger&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the Bible, there are instances where Jesus displayed anger. It is important to understand that Jesus' anger was not fueled by selfishness or personal slights; rather, it was motivated by His zeal for God's house and His concern for holiness and worship. His anger had the right focus, targeting sinful behavior and true injustice, rather than being directed at God or others' weaknesses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Right Motivation for Anger&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus' anger had the proper motivation. It arose from genuine and righteous reasons, not from petty arguments or personal offenses against Him. There was no selfishness involved in His anger. Instead, Jesus' anger was driven by His deep concern for God's holiness and the true worship of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Right Focus for Anger&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus' anger had the proper focus. He was not angry at God or at the weaknesses of others. His anger was directed at sinful behavior and genuine injustice. Jesus' desire was to address these issues and bring about righteousness and justice in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Right Supplement to Anger&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Jesus became angry, it was accompanied by grief over the lack of faith displayed by those He confronted. His anger stemmed from love for the people and concern for their spiritual condition. It had nothing to do with hatred or ill will. Jesus' anger was always rooted in a genuine desire to see people turn to God and experience His love and grace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Right Control over Anger&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus never lost control of His emotions, even in moments of anger. He demonstrated self-control and always acted in accordance with God's will. When He cleared the temple of the moneychangers and animal-sellers, He did so in a measured and purposeful manner. Jesus' emotions were always under control, and He never allowed His anger to lead Him into sin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Right Duration of Anger&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OuNwEyP6BvM" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus did not allow His anger to turn into bitterness or grudges. He dealt with each situation properly and in a timely manner. Jesus' anger was always focused on accomplishing God's will, and once the situation was addressed, He moved on without holding onto anger or resentment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Right Result of Anger&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus' anger always led to godly action. When He became angry, it inevitably resulted in righteous behavior and the fulfillment of God's purposes. Jesus' actions were guided by the Word of God, and His response to anger was always aimed at accomplishing God's will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding Jesus' anger helps us navigate our own emotions. It teaches us that anger itself is not inherently sinful, but rather how we handle it determines whether it becomes destructive or righteous. We should strive to have the right motivation, focus, supplement, control, duration, and result when dealing with anger. By following Jesus' example, we can address injustice and sin in a way that honors God and promotes His kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Think About It&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have you ever experienced anger that was motivated by righteous reasons? How did you handle it?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can we ensure that our anger is focused on addressing sin and injustice rather than being directed at God or others' weaknesses?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In what ways can we supplement our anger with love and concern for the spiritual well-being of others?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can we maintain control over our emotions, particularly when experiencing anger?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reflect on a time when your anger led to godly action. What lessons can you draw from that experience?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By examining Jesus' display of anger, we can learn valuable lessons about handling our own emotions and seeking to bring about righteousness in the world around us. Let us strive to follow Jesus' example by having the right motivation, focus, supplement, control, duration, and result when dealing with anger.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Jesus Christ/The Person of Jesus/Jesus’ Character"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Embracing Grace: Jesus'' Transformative Encounters with Sinners</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/jesus-with-sinners/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-05-21T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-05-21T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-05-21:/jesus-with-sinners/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Jesus Eating with Sinners&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Gospels, we see Jesus repeatedly spending time with sinners and outcasts of society. One notable instance is when Jesus ate a meal with "many tax collectors and sinners" at Matthew's house (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/2/Mark-2-15.html"&gt;Mark 2:15&lt;/a&gt;).

&lt;p&gt;In the Gospels, we see Jesus repeatedly spending time with sinners and outcasts of society. One notable instance is when Jesus ate a meal with "many tax collectors and sinners" at Matthew's house (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/2/Mark-2-15.html"&gt;Mark 2:15&lt;/a&gt;). This act drew criticism from the scribes and Pharisees, who considered themselves righteous and looked down upon those they deemed as sinners. However, Jesus' actions were in line with His mission to seek and save the lost (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/19/Luke-19-10.html"&gt;Luke 19:10&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Pharisees' Attitude towards Sinners&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During Jesus' time, the Pharisees held positions of high esteem in Jewish society. They were strict adherents to the Law and were seen as exemplars of piety. However, they avoided those they considered sinners, such as tax collectors, who were notorious for embezzlement and collaborating with the Romans. The Pharisees believed that by keeping their distance from sinners, they maintained their own righteousness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Jesus' Purpose in Eating with Sinners&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus chose to eat with sinners because they were the ones who needed to know that repentance and forgiveness were available. As Jesus' ministry grew, He became more popular among the social outcasts of society. Since Matthew was now part of His inner circle, Jesus naturally had more contact with these pariahs. It was important for Him to spend time with them in order to reach the lost. After all, Jesus said, "It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/5/Luke-5-31.html"&gt;Luke 5:31&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/w5GXnM_TxSQ" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By sitting at Matthew's feast and eating with sinners, Jesus challenged societal taboos and condemned the legalistic mindset of the Pharisees. He looked beyond cultural norms and saw people's hearts. While the Pharisees disregarded individuals based on their past behavior, Jesus recognized their spiritual need for repentance and forgiveness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Jesus' Compassion for Sinners&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout His ministry, Jesus consistently reached out to those who needed Him. He engaged in conversation with a despised Samaritan woman, surprising even His disciples (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/4/John-4-27.html"&gt;John 4:27&lt;/a&gt;). He forgave an immoral woman in Luke 7, helped a Syro-Phoenician woman in Mark 7, touched a leper in Luke 5, and dined with Zacchaeus in Luke 19. In all these instances, Jesus showed compassion and love to the untouchable and unloved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus came to save sinners. He did not come to condemn the world but to offer salvation (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/3/John-3-17.html"&gt;John 3:17&lt;/a&gt;). Jesus saw individuals beyond their labels and recognized their need for a Savior. The miracles He performed were a testament to His righteousness, and sinners were drawn to Him because of His compassion and sincerity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Lessons from Jesus' Interaction with Sinners&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus' interactions with sinners teach us valuable lessons. First, we should not let social status or cultural norms dictate our relationships with people. Just as Jesus sought out the lost sheep wherever they had strayed, we too should be willing to reach out to those who need to hear the good news of the kingdom. We must not be deterred by criticism or judgment from self-righteous individuals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, Jesus did not require people to change before coming to Him. Instead, He met them where they were and extended grace to them in their circumstances. Change would come from the inside out for those who accepted Christ. As believers, we should follow Jesus' example by showing kindness and compassion, understanding that it is God's kindness that leads people to repentance (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/2/Romans-2-4.html"&gt;Romans 2:4&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding Jesus' interactions with sinners is important because it challenges us to examine our own attitudes towards those we may consider as sinners or outcasts. We are called to love and show compassion to all people, just as Jesus did. By following His example, we can be effective ambassadors for Christ and bring the message of salvation to those who need it most.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reflect on how Jesus' interactions with sinners challenge your own attitudes towards those who may be considered outcasts in society.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are there any individuals or groups of people that you tend to avoid or judge? How can you show them the love and compassion of Christ?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consider how Jesus' approach to evangelism differs from the legalistic mindset of the Pharisees. How can you adopt a similar approach in sharing the gospel with others?&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this article, we will explore the relationship between Jesus, Jews, Christians, and Judaism. We will address the question of why Christians do not follow Judaism despite Jesus being a Jew. It is important to understand that the laws of Judaism were given to Moses for the children of Israel in a sacred covenant at Mount Sinai. This covenant was recorded in the book of Exodus, and Israel was commanded to be obedient to all that was revealed to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Covenant of Moses&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The covenant given to the children of Israel through Moses was a special and significant event in their history. God wrote His laws on tablets of stone, and Israel was expected to obey them faithfully. However, this covenant was only a foreshadowing of a new and better covenant that God would establish with His people in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The New Covenant&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new covenant is prophesied in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Jeremiah/31/Jeremiah-31-31.html"&gt;Jeremiah 31:31-34&lt;/a&gt;. God declares that He will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and the house of Judah. This new covenant would not be like the one made with their forefathers when they were led out of Egypt because they had broken that covenant. In this new covenant, God would put His law in their minds and write it on their hearts. He would be their God, and they would be His people. In this new covenant, everyone would know the Lord personally, and their sins would be forgiven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Jesus Fulfills the Old Covenant&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christians do not follow Judaism today because Jesus Christ has fulfilled the Mosaic covenant. Jesus Himself said, "Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/5/Matthew-5-17.html"&gt;Matthew 5:17&lt;/a&gt;). The writer of Hebrews also affirms this fulfillment, stating that by calling the new covenant "new," God has made the first one obsolete (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/8/Hebrews-8-13.html"&gt;Hebrews 8:13&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9bbjW6zGlTc" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;A Better Covenant&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through Jesus, Christians have entered into a better covenant. This new covenant is superior to the old covenant because it is established on better promises and has a better sacrifice. In the old covenant, sacrifices had to be made repeatedly for the forgiveness of sins. However, in the new covenant, Jesus' sacrificial death on the cross serves as the ultimate and final atonement for sin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Access to God&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the old covenant, only the high priest could enter the Most Holy Place in the temple once a year to make atonement for the people's sins. However, in the new covenant, all believers have direct access to God through Jesus Christ. The writer of Hebrews encourages believers to draw near to God with confidence because of the blood of Jesus that cleanses them from guilt and gives them assurance of faith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Holding Unswervingly to Hope&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Christians, we are called to hold unswervingly to the hope we profess. This hope is grounded in the faithfulness of God and the promises of the new covenant. The writer of Hebrews urges believers to persevere in their faith, knowing that Christ is a faithful high priest who intercedes for them before God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the relationship between Jesus, Jews, Christians, and Judaism is crucial for Christians as it helps us grasp the significance of Jesus' life, death, and resurrection. It reveals how Jesus fulfilled the law and established a new covenant that offers forgiveness, direct access to God, and eternal hope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Think About It&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consider how the new covenant through Jesus Christ provides a greater understanding of God's love and grace compared to the old covenant.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reflect on how having direct access to God through Jesus Christ impacts your relationship with Him.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ponder on the importance of holding unswervingly to the hope we have in Christ, especially in challenging times.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question of Jesus' ethnicity may seem straightforward, but it is not without controversy. The biblical record affirms that Jesus was indeed a Jew. Let's explore what the Bible has to say on this matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Jesus' Jewish Lineage and Life&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Jesus' time, Jewish identity was …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Was Jesus a Jew?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question of Jesus' ethnicity may seem straightforward, but it is not without controversy. The biblical record affirms that Jesus was indeed a Jew. Let's explore what the Bible has to say on this matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Jesus' Jewish Lineage and Life&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Jesus' time, Jewish identity was determined by being born to a Jewish mother or through formal conversion to Judaism. Jesus fulfilled both criteria. He was born in Judah to a Jewish mother and raised in a Jewish household in Galilee. Throughout His ministry, Jesus taught in Jerusalem, the Jewish capital, and ministered to the Jewish people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Biblical Record&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biblical record provides evidence of Jesus' Jewish heritage. The Gospel of Matthew begins with a genealogy that traces Jesus' lineage back to Abraham and King David. This establishes His rightful claim to the Jewish throne. Additionally, the angel Gabriel proclaimed that Jesus would inherit the throne of David and reign over Jacob's descendants forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the author of Hebrews confirms that Jesus descended from Judah, one of Jacob's sons. This lineage establishes Jesus' connection to the tribe of Judah and his fulfillment of messianic prophecies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BSzwqQAnueI" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Jesus' Observance of Jewish Customs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus lived a Jewish lifestyle and observed Jewish customs and traditions. He grew up in a devout Jewish home where His parents faithfully followed the requirements of the law. Throughout His ministry, Jesus taught in synagogues and even in the temple. He acknowledged the authority of the Law and the Prophets and taught others to keep the commandments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus actively participated in significant Jewish feasts such as Passover, the Feast of Tabernacles, and Hanukkah. He was recognized as the King of the Jews during His crucifixion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Messiah and Jesus' Mission&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Old Testament prophecies, the Messiah was chosen by God to redeem Israel and rule from Zion, bringing peace, righteousness, and security to the Jewish people. Jesus, as the Jewish Messiah and the Son of David, was sent specifically to the Jews. In His earthly ministry, Jesus focused on reaching the lost sheep of Israel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, through His death and resurrection, Jesus secured salvation for all who would trust in Him, regardless of their nationality or background. The Jewish Messiah became the Savior for people worldwide. This expansion of salvation is highlighted in the New Testament book of Ephesians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding Jesus as a Jew highlights the historical and cultural context in which He lived and ministered. It deepens our appreciation for His fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies and His connection to the Jewish people. Recognizing Jesus' Jewish identity also helps us grasp the significance of His role as the Messiah and Savior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider the profound implications of Jesus' Jewish heritage. Reflect on how His fulfillment of messianic prophecies and His identification with the Jewish people demonstrate God's faithfulness to His promises throughout history. How does this deepen your understanding of Jesus' mission and impact your own faith journey?&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Jesus Christ/The Person of Jesus/Jesus’ Religion"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Did Jesus Ever Laugh? Unveiling the Joyful Side of Christ</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/did-jesus-ever-laugh/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-05-17T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-05-17T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-05-17:/did-jesus-ever-laugh/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Did Jesus Ever Laugh?&lt;/h2&gt;

While it is true that Jesus experienced immense suffering and was despised and rejected by mankind …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Did Jesus Ever Laugh?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There has been a common belief that Jesus never laughed, as traditional portrayals of Him often depicted a somber and serious Savior. However, this notion may not be entirely accurate. While it is true that Jesus experienced immense suffering and was despised and rejected by mankind, it does not mean that He never had moments of joy or laughter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Jesus' Well-Rounded Personality&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Gospels present Jesus as having a well-rounded and magnetic personality. He showed love and compassion for children, carrying them in His arms (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/10/Mark-10-16.html"&gt;Mark 10:16&lt;/a&gt;). It is difficult to imagine a scenario where children would willingly be around someone who never laughed or expressed joy. In fact, Jesus was even accused of being joyful at times (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/7/Luke-7-34.html"&gt;Luke 7:34&lt;/a&gt;). He also told John's disciples that it was not a time for mourning (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/9/Matthew-9-15.html"&gt;Matthew 9:15&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;God's Sense of Humor&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact that humans have a sense of humor indicates that God also possesses a sense of humor since we are made in His image. The existence of creatures like penguins, platypuses, and puppies also suggests that God has a playful side. As the Son of God, Jesus shares the Father's attributes, including a sense of humor. Furthermore, as the Son of Man, Jesus fully experienced the range of human emotions. Laughter is an integral part of life, and denying Jesus' ability to express joy through laughter would be denying His full humanity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Jesus' Sense of Humor in His Teachings&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus often employed humor in His teachings to engage His audience and convey important messages. For example, His discussion about removing the "log" from one's eye is purposefully exaggerated and lighthearted (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/7/Matthew-7-3.html"&gt;Matthew 7:3-5&lt;/a&gt;). Similarly, the image of a camel going through the eye of a needle contains an element of humor (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/19/Matthew-19-24.html"&gt;Matthew 19:24&lt;/a&gt;). Jesus used these humorous illustrations to make His teachings more relatable and memorable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/om8xOyJ8VMM" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Joyful Laughter Encouraged by Jesus&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Beatitudes recorded in Matthew 5 and Luke 6, Jesus blessed those who weep, promising that they would laugh. He spoke of rejoicing in His parables in Luke 15, where the lost sheep, the lost coin, and the lost son were all found, leading to great rejoicing. Jesus even explained that these stories illustrated the joy experienced by the angels of God over one sinner who repents (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/15/Luke-15-10.html"&gt;Luke 15:10&lt;/a&gt;). This demonstrates that Jesus not only encouraged joyful laughter but also celebrated when people turned to God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Jesus' Serious Mission but Lived Joyfully&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Jesus had a serious mission to accomplish in this world, it does not mean that He was somber all the time. There is no specific verse in the Bible that states, "Jesus laughed," but we know from His complete empathy with humanity and His experience of all emotions that laughter was likely part of His life. Laughter is an essential aspect of human existence, and Jesus fully embraced life in all its richness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding that Jesus had moments of joy and laughter helps us relate to Him on a deeper level. It reminds us that He experienced the full range of human emotions and understands our own struggles and joys. Knowing that Jesus encouraged laughter and celebrated moments of joy also reminds us that Christianity is not solely about suffering and sacrifice but encompasses abundant life and celebration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reflect on your image of Jesus. Does it align more with a serious and somber figure or someone who also experienced joy and laughter?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does the idea of Jesus laughing impact your understanding of His humanity? Does it make Him feel more relatable?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consider the role of joy and laughter in your own spiritual journey. How can you incorporate more joy and celebration into your relationship with God?&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus' treatment of women during His time on earth was revolutionary and counter-cultural. In a society where women were often marginalized and considered second-class citizens, Jesus shattered these prejudices and elevated the status of women to unprecedented heights. This article will explore the ways in which Jesus valued and empowered women, as well as the implications of His teachings for Christians today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Value of Women in God's Plan&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus' elevation of women began even before He was born. God chose a woman, Mary, to be the mother of His Son, entrusting her with the most important message the world has ever received (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/1/Luke-1-26.html"&gt;Luke 1:26&lt;/a&gt;–38). Furthermore, when Jesus was only eight days old, the Holy Spirit revealed His identity to a woman named Anna (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/2/Luke-2-36.html"&gt;Luke 2:36&lt;/a&gt;–38). These instances demonstrate that God recognized and valued women from the very beginning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Jesus' Inclusive Ministry&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout His earthly ministry, women flocked to hear Jesus teach and some even supported Him financially (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/27/Matthew-27-55.html"&gt;Matthew 27:55&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/15/Mark-15-41.html"&gt;Mark 15:41&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/8/Luke-8-2.html"&gt;Luke 8:2&lt;/a&gt;–3). Jesus treated women with the same love, respect, and dignity that He showed to men. He included several women among His closest friends and disciples (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/10/Luke-10-38.html"&gt;Luke 10:38&lt;/a&gt;–39; 24:10; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/11/John-11-5.html"&gt;John 11:5&lt;/a&gt;). This inclusivity was radical for the time. The fact that women are named in the Bible is significant because it challenges the cultural norm that women were not worth mentioning. Jesus' actions shattered these social norms and emphasized the important roles that women played in furthering God's kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Breaking Cultural Barriers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus did not shy away from engaging with people who were considered outcasts or marginalized by society. One powerful example is His encounter with an immoral Samaritan woman at a well (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/4/John-4-4.html"&gt;John 4:4&lt;/a&gt;–26). In a culture where Jews avoided any interaction with Samaritans, Jesus broke down barriers and spoke to her, transforming her life and impacting an entire city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ordhsDeAt60" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another instance that showcases Jesus' treatment of women is His response to the woman caught in adultery (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/8/John-8-2.html"&gt;John 8:2&lt;/a&gt;–11). The Jewish leaders brought her to Jesus, hoping to trap Him with a dilemma. However, Jesus turned the tables on them and challenged their self-righteousness. He demonstrated that everyone is a sinner and that no one has the right to pass judgment on others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Women at the Crucifixion and Resurrection&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During Jesus' crucifixion, women were the last to leave His side and the first to visit His empty tomb (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/27/Matthew-27-61.html"&gt;Matthew 27:61&lt;/a&gt;; 28:1). This displays their courage and boldness, which were a result of the transforming power of Jesus in their lives. In a beautiful display of faith, these women became the world's first witnesses of the resurrection (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/28/Matthew-28-8.html"&gt;Matthew 28:8&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Implications for Christians Today&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus' treatment of women serves as an example for Christians today. When Jesus calls a man or a woman to follow Him, He transforms them into new creatures (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/2-Corinthians/5/2-Corinthians-5-17.html"&gt;2 Corinthians 5:17&lt;/a&gt;). Old prejudices and stereotypes no longer define us. As Christians, we are united by one Spirit (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Ephesians/4/Ephesians-4-5.html"&gt;Ephesians 4:5&lt;/a&gt;), viewing each other as brothers and sisters in the family of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means that men and women should work together in harmony, recognizing the unique contributions each gender brings to the family and the church. There is neither male nor female in Christ; we are all equal in His eyes (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Galatians/3/Galatians-3-28.html"&gt;Galatians 3:28&lt;/a&gt;). This should encourage us to value and empower women within our communities, ensuring they have equal opportunities to serve and lead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding Jesus' treatment of women is crucial because it challenges cultural norms and prejudices that still exist today. It reminds us of the inherent value and worth of every individual, regardless of gender. By embracing Jesus' example, we can create a more inclusive and egalitarian society where both men and women can thrive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider the ways in which you can actively value and empower women within your church and community. Are there any biases or stereotypes that you need to confront and overcome? How can you follow Jesus' example of treating women with dignity, compassion, and respect? Prayerfully reflect on these questions and ask God to guide you in promoting equality and inclusivity.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Jesus Christ/The Person of Jesus/Jesus’ Friendships"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Was Jesus a Christian?

&lt;p&gt;It may sound strange to say, but no, Jesus was not a Christian. While Jesus is the foundation for the Christian faith, He Himself could not be called a Christian. Christianity is built upon His identity as the Son of God, His perfect life, and His substitutionary death and resurrection for the forgiveness of sins. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus did not come into the world to start another religion. He came to complete the work of God in redeeming sinful mankind. He came to defeat our enemy, Satan. He came to seek and save the lost. He came to fulfill the righteous requirements of the law. He came to establish a new covenant between God and mankind. He came "to redeem us from all wickedness and to purify for himself a people that are his very own, eager to do what is good." &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christianity is the result of Christ's finished work of salvation, and He now builds His church. Christianity is not a religion in the sense that it is man's attempt to reach up to God; rather, Christianity teaches that God has reached down to man. Jesus, as the second Person of the Trinity, took on human flesh and was literally God reaching out to us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus was not a Christian; He was a Jewish rabbi. Jesus followed the Jewish law that God had given to Moses. He lived perfectly under the law in order to present Himself as a sacrifice without blemish, acceptable under that law. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The coming of Jesus was the fulfillment of God's promise to send His Messiah to rescue His people and reign over them forever. For centuries, God had promised this deliverance and through Jesus, it was finally realized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Term "Christian"&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another reason that Jesus cannot be called a Christian is that the term itself was not coined until after His resurrection and ascension into heaven. Believers were first called Christians in the city of Antioch in Syria. The term means "little Christs" and was originally used in a derogatory way. However, believers came to embrace it as a badge of honor. Christians today should obey the voice of their Master and still consider themselves "little Christs" in the sense that they imitate the Lord Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding that Jesus was not a Christian helps us to grasp the unique role He played in God's plan of salvation. It emphasizes His divinity as the Son of God and the fulfillment of God's promises throughout history. Recognizing Jesus as a Jewish rabbi also highlights the importance of understanding the Jewish roots of Christianity and how Jesus perfectly fulfilled the Old Testament law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Think About It&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider the significance of Jesus being called the Messiah, the Anointed One. How does this title reflect His role as both Savior and King? How does understanding Jesus' Jewish identity impact your understanding of Christianity? Reflect on how you can strive to be a "little Christ," imitating Jesus in your thoughts, words, and actions.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Jesus Christ/The Person of Jesus/Jesus’ Religion"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Was Jesus Black, White, or Middle Eastern? Unveiling the True Race of Jesus</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/what-race-was-jesus/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-04-21T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-04-21T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-04-21:/what-race-was-jesus/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;What Race was Jesus?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout history, people have been curious about the physical appearance of Jesus Christ. While the Bible does not provide a detailed description of Jesus' physical appearance, we can gather some information based on the historical and cultural context in which He lived. However, it's important to …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;What Race was Jesus?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout history, people have been curious about the physical appearance of Jesus Christ. While the Bible does not provide a detailed description of Jesus' physical appearance, we can gather some information based on the historical and cultural context in which He lived. However, it's important to note that the Bible gives little, if any, direct description of what Jesus might have looked like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Understanding the Context&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jewish Heritage: Jesus was born into a Jewish family, which suggests that His appearance would align with the typical features of Jewish people in the region during that era.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Historical Insights: Scholars often look to historical texts and archaeological findings from the time to hypothesize about the common physical traits of men in first-century Judea.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What We Can Infer&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given these contextual clues, one might imagine Jesus with features typical of the Middle Eastern population of His time. Yet, the lack of explicit biblical description highlights a focus on His teachings and actions rather than His physical form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By understanding the cultural and historical backdrop, we can appreciate why the Bible emphasizes His spiritual significance over physical attributes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Jesus, a Middle Eastern Jewish Man&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus was born in Bethlehem and raised in Nazareth, a town in Galilee, which is located in northern Israel. This makes Him a Middle Eastern, Hebraic Jewish man. The Bible tells us that Jesus was from the lineage of King David and was born into the Jewish faith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Jesus' Multi-Ethnic Heritage&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we trace Jesus' genealogy, we discover that His bloodline includes various races and cultural lines. For example, Jesus had Moabite ancestry through Ruth and Canaanite ancestry through Rahab. This indicates that Jesus had a multi-ethnic Jewish heritage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Depictions of Jesus' Appearance&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The earliest depictions of Jesus portray Him with a dark complexion, reflecting His Middle Eastern background. However, as time went on, artists began depicting Him with European features such as light skin, a beard, and long, light brown hair. It is important to remember that these depictions are artistic interpretations and may not accurately reflect Jesus' actual appearance.
While these artistic renditions vary, there are groups, often associated with the &amp;quot;Black Hebrew&amp;quot; movement, who assert that Jesus was black or African in appearance. This perspective diverges from the traditional view of Jesus' Jewish heritage, which suggests He likely had light to dark brown skin typical of the Middle Eastern region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The truth is, the Bible provides little detail about what Jesus looked like, leaving much room for interpretation. While Jesus is widely recognized as being of Jewish heritage, the focus on his physical characteristics often overshadows more significant aspects of his life and teachings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the grand scheme of redemption, the color of Jesus' skin does not hold importance. What truly matters is the transformative power of his message and the spiritual life he offers. As stated in biblical teachings, it is his divine power that grants us everything needed for life and godliness, guiding us toward a life of glory and moral excellence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than concentrating on physical appearances, we should direct our attention to the qualities that define his mission: glory, goodness, and the call to live pure and righteous lives. These spiritual attributes are what inspire individuals to seek a deeper connection with him, transcending any visual depictions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is the level of certainty regarding Jesus' appearance?
There is no definitive description of Jesus' physical appearance in the Bible, leaving His exact skin color and features uncertain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does the color of Jesus' skin matter theologically?
The question of Jesus' skin color is often viewed as secondary to His teachings and message, implying that the debate might overlook more important theological considerations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What does the Bible say about Jesus' ethnicity?
The Bible emphasizes that Jesus was Jewish, which suggests He likely had a Middle Eastern appearance, with skin tones ranging from light to dark brown.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are some beliefs about Jesus' racial or ethnic appearance?
Some groups, particularly those connected to the "Black Hebrew" movement, assert that Jesus was black or African in appearance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;What does Isaiah say about the physical appearance of Jesus?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the prophet Isaiah, the physical appearance of Jesus is described in quite humble terms. Isaiah portrays Jesus as lacking in physical allure or grandeur that would typically draw people to him. He is depicted as &amp;quot;a tender shoot&amp;quot; arising from dry ground, implying fragility and a lack of majesty. This description emphasizes that there was nothing striking or desirable in his appearance to attract attention or admiration. Isaiah's portrayal suggests that Jesus' significance lies not in his physical appearance but in his spiritual and moral presence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Understanding the Mission of Jesus&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it is fascinating to consider what race Jesus belonged to, it is even more important to understand His mission. Jesus came to identify with people of every race and ethnicity. He transcends racial divisions and calls us to unite in faith and love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Did the apostles adapt to different cultures while maintaining their message?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout history, the apostles demonstrated an ability to adapt to different cultural contexts while steadfastly maintaining the core message of Christianity. When Paul and the other apostles journeyed to diverse regions, they tailored their teaching approaches to better resonate with local customs and traditions, ensuring that the message of Christ was accessible and relatable to all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, what remained unchanged was the essence of their message. Regardless of who they preached to—be it people of different races, languages, or cultures—the apostles consistently conveyed the transformative power of the gospel. By doing so, they ensured that the timeless truth of Christ's teachings reached a multitude of hearts, transcending cultural barriers and connecting with anyone yearning to understand the divine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their strategy proved effective not just in ancient times but continues to resonate today. The principles of their teachings remain relevant across varied cultural landscapes, illustrating that while methods of communication can evolve, the foundational message remains a constant source of hope and inspiration for all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;What does the Bible say about favoritism and accepting people from all nations?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bible is clear when it comes to the issue of favoritism and the acceptance of people from all nations. In Acts 10:34–35, Peter speaks to the universal acceptance advocated by God, stating that God does not show favoritism. Instead, He welcomes individuals from every nation who fear Him and strive to do what is right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This message of inclusivity is echoed in the teachings of Jesus. In Matthew 28:18–20, He instructs His followers to go forth and share the gospel with all nations, emphasizing that cultural or racial barriers should not exist in spreading His message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Apostle Paul further reinforces this theme of unity across diverse groups. In Galatians 3:28, he writes to the Galatian churches, underscoring that distinctions such as Jew or Greek, slave or free, male or female are irrelevant in Christ. Paul explains that all are equal and unified in Jesus, highlighting a core principle of acceptance and equality within the Christian faith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;What is the significance of Acts 4:12 regarding salvation and Jesus?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acts 4:12 holds a profound message about the exclusivity of salvation through Jesus Christ. This verse underscores the belief that Jesus is the sole pathway to spiritual redemption. It emphasizes that no other name or figure under heaven can offer the salvation that humanity seeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The significance lies in its declaration of Jesus as the central and essential figure for redemption. Within Christianity, this verse serves as a cornerstone for the doctrine that faith in Jesus is necessary for salvation. It boldly asserts that salvation is not attainable through other religious leaders, philosophical teachings, or by one's own efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, this passage reflects the early Christians' conviction that Jesus' sacrifice and resurrection uniquely qualify Him as the savior of humanity. It challenges believers and non-believers alike to consider the implications of such an exclusive claim, often prompting discussions on the nature of faith and interfaith dialogue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a broader context, Acts 4:12 invites individuals to explore the tenets of Christianity and reflect on what it means to accept Jesus as the provider of salvation. This verse continues to inspire and encourage those who adhere to its message, highlighting the transformative power they believe is found solely in Jesus's name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Embracing Diversity in Christ&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God created the various races of the world and made each of them unique. He loves all people and sent His Son to save the world. In Christ, racial and national differences fade into the background as we assume our identity as children of God. We are called to accept one another in our differences and to live in unity as one body in Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How the Bible Addresses Cultural and Racial Barriers in Sharing the Gospel&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bible offers profound insights into overcoming cultural and racial barriers when spreading the gospel. At the heart of this message is the Great Commission, in which Jesus instructs his followers to teach the gospel to all nations. This directive underscores the universality of the Christian message, transcending any cultural or racial distinctions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;A Unified Message for All&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul eloquently reaffirms this point in his letter to the Galatians, stating that in Christ, societal divisions fade away: &amp;quot;there is neither Jew nor Greek, slave nor free, male nor female.&amp;quot; The essence of this message is unity, emphasizing that the gospel is meant for everyone, regardless of background or ethnicity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Skin Color and the Gospel&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scripture also makes it clear that external characteristics, such as skin color, are irrelevant when it comes to sharing the gospel. As followers of Christ, the focus remains on the message rather than superficial differences, promoting an inclusive and universal approach to evangelism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Cross-Cultural Adaptability&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the apostles in the early church demonstrated an ability to engage with diverse cultures. While they respected and adapted to different cultural norms, they remained steadfast in their commitment to the core tenets of their faith. This example, highlighted in 1 Corinthians 9:19–23, illustrates how adaptability does not mean compromising one's beliefs but rather finding ways to connect authentically with others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By embracing the biblical vision of unity and inclusivity, we recognize that the gospel is a message without borders, echoing a call to share faith beyond the confines of cultural and racial lines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sk1aM3gO--A" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;What Race was Jesus For?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than focusing on the race of Jesus, it is more important to consider what race Jesus was for. The answer is clear: Jesus came for the entire human race. He came to break down the barriers that separate us and to bring reconciliation and redemption to all people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the grand scheme of redemption, the color of Jesus' skin does not hold significance. This is supported by passages like Ephesians 1:7 and Colossians 1:14, which emphasize the universal nature of redemption through His sacrifice. What truly matters is the message of unity and love that His life and teachings conveyed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Redemption transcends physical attributes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It focuses on the spiritual and eternal, rather than the temporal and physical.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By understanding this, we can appreciate that Jesus' mission was not confined by racial or ethnic boundaries. His purpose was to unite humanity under the banner of love and forgiveness, bridging divides and offering salvation to all, regardless of their background.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The message of the gospel transcends racial and cultural differences. The apostles demonstrated this by adapting their methods to various cultures without compromising the core message of Christ. As Paul stated in 1 Corinthians 9:19–23, he became &amp;quot;all things to all people&amp;quot; to spread the good news, showing that the gospel's power is not bound by the color of anyone's skin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The essence of the gospel lies in its ability to reach hearts regardless of race. As noted in Romans 1:16, the gospel is &amp;quot;the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes.&amp;quot; It worked in the first century, and it continues to work today, touching lives across all shades of humanity—black, white, yellow, or brown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, it's not the color of Jesus' skin or our neighbor's skin that matters in the realm of eternal destiny. What truly matters is the message of salvation, as Acts 4:12 reminds us that &amp;quot;salvation is found in no one else.&amp;quot; Jesus' mission was to unite and save the human race, a mission that remains just as relevant and powerful today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the racial background of Jesus helps us appreciate the diverse nature of humanity and can challenge any biases or prejudices we may hold. Embracing diversity is a central message of the Gospel, and recognizing Jesus' mission to unite all races and ethnicities can inspire us to strive for unity and love within our own communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Think About It&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does recognizing Jesus' multi-ethnic heritage challenge your own preconceived notions about race?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In what ways can you actively work towards embracing diversity within your church community or personal relationships?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reflect on the concept that Jesus came for the entire human race. How does this impact your understanding of His love and grace?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Christians, let us remember that our identity is found in Christ, and through Him, we can find unity and love in a world divided by race and ethnicity.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Jesus Christ/The Person of Jesus/Jesus’ Appearance"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>What Did Jesus Really Look Like?

While we do not have a detailed account of His appearance, we can gather some insights from the Scriptures. According to Isaiah 53:2b, Jesus had no …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Jesus: What Did He Look Like?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The physical appearance of Jesus during His time on earth is not explicitly described in the Bible. While we do not have a detailed account of His appearance, we can gather some insights from the Scriptures. According to Isaiah 53:2b, Jesus had no exceptional physical beauty or majesty that would draw people to Him. This suggests that His appearance was ordinary and unremarkable. Isaiah prophesied that the suffering Servant would come in humble conditions, without the usual signs of royalty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isaiah further describes the appearance of Christ during His scourging before His crucifixion. In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/52/Isaiah-52-14.html"&gt;Isaiah 52:14&lt;/a&gt;, it is mentioned that His appearance was disfigured beyond recognition, surpassing the likeness of any man. This description indicates the extreme cruelty and suffering that Jesus endured, to the point where He no longer resembled a human being. We can see evidence of this in the accounts of His crucifixion in the New Testament, where He was mocked and beaten (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/26/Matthew-26-67.html"&gt;Matthew 26:67&lt;/a&gt;; 27:30; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/19/John-19-3.html"&gt;John 19:3&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to note that many of the popular depictions of Jesus today may not be accurate representations. Jesus was a Jewish man, so it is likely that He had dark skin, dark eyes, and dark hair. This differs significantly from the European/Caucasian portrayal that has become common in modern imagery. However, it is crucial to understand that the physical appearance of Jesus is not emphasized in Scripture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding what Jesus looked like may seem like an interesting topic, but it is not crucial to our faith or salvation. The Bible focuses on the message and significance of Jesus' life, death, and resurrection rather than His physical appearance. Our faith should be grounded in who Jesus is as the Son of God and what He has done for us, rather than how He looked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does the lack of a detailed physical description of Jesus challenge us to focus on His character and message rather than His appearance?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why do you think people often have their own perceptions and depictions of Jesus' physical appearance, even when it may not align with historical or biblical evidence?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Misconceptions about Jesus' Appearance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout history, various misconceptions have arisen regarding the physical appearance of Jesus. These misconceptions often stem from cultural biases and artistic interpretations rather than biblical evidence. It is essential to distinguish between these misconceptions and the actual information provided in Scripture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Cultural Bias and Artistic Interpretations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The predominant images of Jesus that we encounter today are often influenced by European or Caucasian depictions. However, it is important to remember that Jesus was a Jewish man living in the Middle East. Therefore, it is more likely that He had features typical of the region, including dark skin, dark eyes, and dark hair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The widespread portrayal of a European-looking Jesus is primarily a result of cultural bias and artistic interpretation. Artists throughout history have depicted Jesus in ways that were familiar and relatable to their own cultural context. These depictions were not necessarily accurate representations but rather reflections of the artists' cultural backgrounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Significance of Jesus' Appearance&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it is interesting to consider what Jesus may have looked like, it is crucial to recognize that His appearance does not hold significant theological importance. The Bible focuses on who Jesus is, His teachings, and His redemptive work, rather than His physical attributes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Christians, our faith should be centered on our relationship with Jesus as the Son of God and our Savior. Our understanding of Him should be based on His character, teachings, and the significance of His life, death, and resurrection for our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By recognizing the cultural biases and artistic interpretations that have influenced our perception of Jesus' appearance, we can avoid falling into the trap of idolizing an inaccurate image. Instead, we can focus on the essence of Jesus' message and the impact of His work in our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does understanding the cultural bias in historical depictions of Jesus challenge our own preconceived notions?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can a more accurate understanding of Jesus' appearance help us relate to Him as a real historical figure rather than an idealized image?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Biblical Silence on Jesus' Appearance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One might wonder why the Bible does not provide a detailed physical description of Jesus. If His appearance was significant or essential for our faith, surely there would be more information available. However, the absence of a detailed physical description is purposeful and aligns with the biblical emphasis on spiritual matters rather than physical attributes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Focus on Spiritual Truths&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout Scripture, the primary focus is on communicating spiritual truths and revealing God's plan for salvation. The Gospels provide accounts of Jesus' teachings, miracles, and interactions with people, highlighting His divine nature and redemptive mission. The emphasis is on who Jesus is and what He came to accomplish rather than his physical appearance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lack of a physical description allows us to focus on the spiritual significance of Jesus' life, death, and resurrection. It prevents us from fixating on external appearances and encourages us to seek a deeper understanding of His character and teachings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fQ6iMzAQydU" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The Testimony of Eyewitnesses&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it were necessary for us to know Jesus' physical appearance, we would expect the New Testament writers to provide more details. However, even those who spent three years with Jesus, such as Matthew, Peter, and John, do not offer any descriptions of His physical attributes. His own brothers James and Jude, who were also eyewitnesses to His life, do not provide any specific details about His appearance either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This silence suggests that the physical appearance of Jesus was not a significant aspect of His ministry or the message He came to proclaim. The focus of the biblical accounts is on the spiritual truths and the transformative power of Jesus' life and teachings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The absence of a physical description of Jesus challenges us to seek a deeper understanding of His character, teachings, and mission. It encourages us to focus on the spiritual significance of His life rather than being distracted by external appearances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does the lack of a physical description of Jesus challenge us to rely on our faith rather than physical evidence?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why do you think God chose not to provide a detailed physical description of Jesus in Scripture? What might be the purpose behind this decision?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the Bible does not provide a detailed physical description of Jesus, we can gather some insights from Scripture. According to Isaiah, Jesus' appearance was ordinary and unremarkable, without any exceptional beauty or majesty. Additionally, Isaiah's prophecy indicates that Jesus' appearance was disfigured during His crucifixion, surpassing any human likeness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to recognize that many popular depictions of Jesus today may not accurately represent His appearance. As a Jewish man living in the Middle East, it is likely that Jesus had dark skin, dark eyes, and dark hair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, it is crucial to remember that the physical appearance of Jesus is not emphasized in Scripture. Our faith should be grounded in who Jesus is as the Son of God and what He has done for us rather than how He looked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By understanding the cultural biases and artistic interpretations that have influenced our perception of Jesus' appearance, we can avoid idolizing an inaccurate image. Instead, we can focus on the essence of Jesus' message and the impact of His work in our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lack of a detailed physical description challenges us to seek a deeper understanding of Jesus' character, teachings, and mission. It encourages us to rely on our faith and focus on the spiritual significance of His life rather than being distracted by external appearances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, the physical appearance of Jesus may remain a mystery, but the spiritual truths and transformative power of His life continue to impact countless lives. Let us fix our eyes on Jesus, the author, and perfecter of our faith, and seek to know Him more deeply.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Jesus Christ/The Person of Jesus/Jesus’ Appearance"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Unveiling the Mystical Truth: Did Jesus Have Long Hair?</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/jesus-long-hair/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-04-05T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-04-05T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-04-05:/jesus-long-hair/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Jesus and His Appearance&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout history, many artistic portrayals of Jesus depict Him as a Caucasian male with blue eyes and long, light-brown hair. However, it is important to understand that these portrayals are likely inaccurate and do not reflect what Jesus truly looked like. Jesus was ethnically Jewish, so His physical appearance would have been more in line with that of a typical Middle Easterner. In this article, we will explore the topic of Jesus' hair length and discuss why it ultimately does not matter in the grand scheme of His role as the Savior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Inaccuracy of Common Portrayals&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The common portrayal of Jesus with long, flowing hair is likely inaccurate for several reasons. Firstly, the Bible does not provide a physical description of Jesus, so any specific claims about His appearance are speculative at best. Secondly, if Jesus looked like a typical Middle Eastern male in the 1st century A.D., then the artistic portrayals of Him with long hair are further called into question. Jewish men during that time period traditionally kept much shorter hair than Jewish women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Cultural Appropriateness and Biblical Context&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The length of Jesus' hair would have been determined by cultural norms and expectations for men at that time. It is important to note that &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-Corinthians/11/1-Corinthians-11-14.html"&gt;1 Corinthians 11:14&lt;/a&gt; states, "Does not nature itself teach you that if a man wears long hair it is a disgrace for him?" This passage suggests that wearing long hair could be considered inappropriate or dishonorable for a man. As such, it is unlikely that Jesus would have had long hair in a way that appeared feminine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the specific length of Jesus' hair cannot be determined with certainty, it would have been masculine-looking according to cultural standards. The exact definition of what constitutes "masculine-looking" hair can vary across different cultures and time periods. However, the underlying principle remains the same: a man's hair should look masculine, while a woman's hair should look feminine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In discussing the length of Jesus' hair, it is crucial to recognize that this topic ultimately does not hold significant theological or salvific importance. The Bible emphasizes Jesus' role as the Savior of the world and the only way to heaven, rather than focusing on His physical appearance. The length of His hair does not impact His ability to fulfill His divine purpose or the message of salvation that He brought to humanity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it can be interesting to explore what Jesus may have looked like based on historical and cultural context, it is essential to remember that our faith does not rest on His physical appearance. Our faith is rooted in His life, teachings, death, and resurrection, which hold eternal significance for all believers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When considering topics related to Jesus' appearance, it is essential to maintain a balanced perspective. While it is natural for curiosity about His physical features to arise, we should not allow these discussions to distract us from the core message of the Gospel. Instead of dwelling on what Jesus may have looked like, let us focus on the profound impact of His life and teachings on our faith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, the common portrayal of Jesus with long hair in artistic depictions is likely inaccurate. Jesus' appearance would have been more in line with that of a typical Middle Easterner during the 1st century A.D. While we cannot definitively determine the exact length of His hair, it would have been culturally appropriate and masculine-looking. However, it is important to remember that Jesus' physical appearance is ultimately irrelevant to His role as the Savior of the world. Our faith rests in His divine nature and the message of salvation that He brought to humanity.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Jesus Christ/The Person of Jesus/Jesus’ Appearance"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry></feed>

&lt;p&gt;The concept of being "a little lower than the angels" is found in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/8/Psalm-8-5.html"&gt;Psalm 8:5&lt;/a&gt;, and it holds significant implications for our understanding of Jesus Christ. In this verse, the psalmist ponders the greatness of God's creation and asks, "What is man that you …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Little Lower Than the Angels&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept of being "a little lower than the angels" is found in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/8/Psalm-8-5.html"&gt;Psalm 8:5&lt;/a&gt;, and it holds significant implications for our understanding of Jesus Christ. In this verse, the psalmist ponders the greatness of God's creation and asks, "What is man that you are mindful of him, and the son of man that you care for him?" The psalmist goes on to acknowledge that God has made humanity "a little lower than the heavenly beings" and has crowned them with glory and honor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Original Meaning&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To grasp the original meaning of this verse, we need to consider its context. In Hebrew, the term "heavenly beings" can also be translated as "angel." Therefore, &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/8/Psalm-8-5.html"&gt;Psalm 8:5&lt;/a&gt; suggests that God has made humanity slightly lower than the angels. The following verse, &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/8/Psalm-8-6.html"&gt;Psalm 8:6&lt;/a&gt;, further emphasizes that God has given mankind dominion over His creation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This understanding aligns with &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/1/Genesis-1-26.html"&gt;Genesis 1:26-28&lt;/a&gt;, which reveals that God gave humanity authority over the created world. Adam, as the representative head of the human race, was created "a little lower than the angels." Despite this positioning, Adam was still crowned with glory and honor because he was made in the image of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Jesus as the Second Adam&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/2/Hebrews-2-6.html"&gt;Hebrews 2:6-8&lt;/a&gt; quotes &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/8/Psalm-8-5.html"&gt;Psalm 8:5&lt;/a&gt; and expands upon its significance. The author of Hebrews applies this verse to Jesus Christ, identifying Him as the "son of man" mentioned in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/8/Psalm-8-4.html"&gt;Psalm 8:4&lt;/a&gt;. By doing so, Hebrews emphasizes Jesus' connection to Adam as the representative head of humanity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus is referred to as the Second Adam or the new Adam who came to deal directly with the consequences brought upon mankind by the first Adam. This includes conquering death, which the first Adam could never accomplish (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-Corinthians/15/1-Corinthians-15-45.html"&gt;1 Corinthians 15:45&lt;/a&gt;). The Gospel of Luke also emphasizes Jesus as the Son of Man, the one who came to deliver mankind from death through His crucifixion, burial, and resurrection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Jesus' Incarnation and Humility&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/F__lEJ3A0GM" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus, in His incarnation, took on sinless flesh and willingly became "a little lower than the angels." &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Philippians/2/Philippians-2-7.html"&gt;Philippians 2:7&lt;/a&gt; describes how Jesus "made himself nothing by taking the very nature of a servant" when He took on human form. He subjected Himself to the Law and lived in perfect obedience (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Galatians/4/Galatians-4-4.html"&gt;Galatians 4:4&lt;/a&gt;). Jesus, who was rich, became poor for our sake (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/2-Corinthians/8/2-Corinthians-8-9.html"&gt;2 Corinthians 8:9&lt;/a&gt;). In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/20/Matthew-20-28.html"&gt;Matthew 20:28&lt;/a&gt;, Jesus declared that He came not to be served but to serve and give His life as a ransom for many.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The angels themselves marvel at the Incarnation and desire to understand the gospel more fully (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-Peter/1/1-Peter-1-12.html"&gt;1 Peter 1:12&lt;/a&gt;). Despite becoming "a little lower than the angels," Jesus never ceased to be God. He displayed the meekness and condescension of God while remaining fully divine. After His atoning work on the cross, Jesus was crowned with glory and honor. He is now seated at the right hand of God the Father (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Colossians/3/Colossians-3-1.html"&gt;Colossians 3:1&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Exaltation of Jesus&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Jesus was made lower than the angels for a temporary period, &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/2/Hebrews-2-7.html"&gt;Hebrews 2:7&lt;/a&gt; assures us that He is now exalted above all angels. &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Philippians/2/Philippians-2-9.html"&gt;Philippians 2:9-11&lt;/a&gt; declares that every knee will bow before Him, and every tongue will confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God the Father.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Believers in Christ will also reign with Him in the future millennium. As the Second Adam, Christ will accomplish what the first Adam and his descendants failed to achieve due to sin. &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/2/Hebrews-2-8.html"&gt;Hebrews 2:8&lt;/a&gt; hints at this by pointing out the subjection of all things to Christ. The curse will be reversed, and believers will share in Christ's glory forever, dwelling with Him in the new heaven and new earth (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/65/Isaiah-65-17.html"&gt;Isaiah 65:17-25&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding Jesus' role as the Second Adam and His humility in becoming "a little lower than the angels" is crucial for Christians. It highlights Jesus' humanity and His unique ability to represent humanity before God. Jesus' incarnation and sacrificial death on the cross provide the means for our redemption and salvation. Without Jesus' willingness to humble Himself and take on human form, there would be no hope of salvation for any of us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contemplating Jesus' humility can inspire us to adopt a servant mindset. Just as Jesus came not to be served but to serve, we are called to follow His example. We should consider how we can humbly serve others, imitating Jesus' selflessness in our interactions with those around us. Additionally, reflecting on Jesus' exaltation reminds us of the ultimate victory that awaits believers in Christ. It encourages us to persevere in faith, knowing that our future is secure and that we will share in Christ's glory forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/8/Psalm-8-5.html"&gt;Psalm 8:5&lt;/a&gt; speaks of humanity being "a little lower than the angels," which finds its fulfillment in Jesus Christ as the Second Adam. Jesus willingly took on human form, experiencing humility and ultimately achieving victory over sin and death. Understanding this truth deepens our appreciation for Jesus' sacrifice and underscores the importance of imitating His humility and service to others.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Jesus Christ/The Nature of Jesus/Humanity"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>'Discover the Divine Power of God the Son: A Christian Revelation'</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/god-the-son/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-09-18T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-09-18T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-09-18:/god-the-son/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;God the Son&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept of the Trinity can be challenging to understand, as it involves the nature of God as three distinct Persons in one.

These three Persons are coequal and coeternal, meaning none …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;God the Son&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept of the Trinity can be challenging to understand, as it involves the nature of God as three distinct Persons in one. The Trinity consists of God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit. These three Persons are coequal and coeternal, meaning none is inferior or superior to the other. In this article, we will focus on God the Son.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Who is God the Son?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God the Son is the second Person of the Trinity. He is revealed to creation as the only and eternally begotten Son of God the Father. While He shares the same essence with God the Father and God the Holy Spirit, He is distinct from them in Personhood and function. God the Son has always existed as fully God (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/1/John-1-1.html"&gt;John 1:1&lt;/a&gt;–2), and He is one with God the Father. However, He submits Himself to the Father in function and work. His primary role is to fulfill the will of God the Father (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/6/John-6-38.html"&gt;John 6:38&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Incarnation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although God the Son is fully divine, He became fully human through an event known as the incarnation. In this act, He took on flesh and experienced humanity in all its aspects, including temptations, trials, weaknesses, and emotions. The purpose of the incarnation was not for Him to lose His divinity or any divine attributes but to perfectly obey the will of God the Father while living as a human being (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Philippians/2/Philippians-2-5.html"&gt;Philippians 2:5&lt;/a&gt;–11; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/2/Hebrews-2-17.html"&gt;Hebrews 2:17&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Life and Ministry of Jesus&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Jesus Christ, God the Son was conceived by the power of God the Holy Spirit and born of a virgin named Mary. He lived a perfect life without sin and grew in wisdom, stature, and favor with both God and humanity. Jesus embarked on a public ministry where He taught people about God's ways and truths. Large crowds followed Him, and He performed numerous miracles, healing people from sicknesses, diseases, and deformities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0SOJEyzdg-M" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Rejection and Crucifixion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over time, Jesus' teachings and miracles caused some religious leaders to feel threatened, leading them to seek His death. Eventually, Jesus was arrested and put on trial before Jewish and Roman authorities who sentenced Him to death. He was crucified on a cross to pay for the sins of the world. After His death, Jesus was buried in a tomb for three days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Resurrection and Salvation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the third day, Jesus rose from the dead by the power of God the Holy Spirit. His resurrection serves as the firstfruits of the new creation promised by God and guarantees the future resurrection of believers upon His return. Through His substitutionary death on the cross and resurrection, God the Son purchased eternal salvation for all those who receive Him by faith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Current Role and Future Return&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, God the Son rules and reigns as the Great High Priest at the right hand of God the Father. He is exalted above all things and intercedes before God the Father on behalf of His people. One day, He will visibly return to earth, defeat all enemies of God, and establish His kingdom where He will rule with His saints for all eternity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the nature of God the Son is essential because it reveals God's love for humanity. Through the incarnation and sacrifice of Jesus Christ, we gain access to salvation and are reconciled to God. Recognizing Jesus as fully divine and fully human helps us grasp the depth of God's love for us and enables us to have a personal relationship with Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Think About It&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider how Jesus' role as both fully divine and fully human impacts your understanding of salvation. How does this truth shape your relationship with God? Reflect on the significance of Jesus' sacrificial death on the cross and what it means for your life.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Jesus Christ/The Nature of Jesus/The Deity of Christ"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>'Unveiling the Divine Mystery: The Incarnation of Christ Explained'</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/incarnation-of-christ/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-09-15T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-09-15T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-09-15:/incarnation-of-christ/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;The Incarnation of Christ&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The incarnation of Christ is a term used by theologians to describe the belief that Jesus, the Son of God, took on human flesh. This concept is closely related to the hypostatic union, which explains how Jesus' two natures, divine and human, are joined together. However, the incarnation specifically emphasizes Jesus' humanity. The word "incarnation" itself means "the act of being made flesh," and it comes from the Latin version of &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/1/John-1-14.html"&gt;John 1:14&lt;/a&gt;, which reads in English as "The Word became flesh and made His dwelling among us." This Latin term became widely used due to the prevalence of the Latin Vulgate translation in the church during the Middle Ages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Jesus' Humanity in the Bible&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biblical support for Jesus' humanity is extensive. The Gospels report various aspects of Jesus' humanity, such as his need for sleep (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/8/Luke-8-23.html"&gt;Luke 8:23&lt;/a&gt;), food (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/4/Matthew-4-2.html"&gt;Matthew 4:2&lt;/a&gt;; 21:18), and physical protection (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/2/Matthew-2-13.html"&gt;Matthew 2:13-15&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/10/John-10-39.html"&gt;John 10:39&lt;/a&gt;). Additionally, there are instances where Jesus perspired (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/22/Luke-22-43.html"&gt;Luke 22:43-44&lt;/a&gt;) and bled (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/19/John-19-34.html"&gt;John 19:34&lt;/a&gt;). He also expressed a range of emotions, including joy (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/15/John-15-11.html"&gt;John 15:11&lt;/a&gt;), sorrow (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/26/Matthew-26-37.html"&gt;Matthew 26:37&lt;/a&gt;), and anger (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/3/Mark-3-5.html"&gt;Mark 3:5&lt;/a&gt;). Throughout his life, Jesus referred to himself as a man (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/8/John-8-40.html"&gt;John 8:40&lt;/a&gt;), and even after his resurrection, his humanity was still recognized (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Acts/2/Acts-2-22.html"&gt;Acts 2:22&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EUNybu7PkDU" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The Purpose of the Incarnation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the purpose of the incarnation was not merely for Jesus to experience human needs or emotions. The Son of God came in the flesh to be the Savior of mankind. First and foremost, it was necessary for him to be born "under the law" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Galatians/4/Galatians-4-4.html"&gt;Galatians 4:4&lt;/a&gt;). All humans have failed to fulfill God's law, and Christ came in the flesh to fulfill the law on our behalf (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/5/Matthew-5-17.html"&gt;Matthew 5:17&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Galatians/4/Galatians-4-5.html"&gt;Galatians 4:5&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, the Savior needed to shed his blood for the forgiveness of sins (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/9/Hebrews-9-22.html"&gt;Hebrews 9:22&lt;/a&gt;). A blood sacrifice requires a body of flesh and blood. This was God's plan for the incarnation, as stated in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/10/Hebrews-10-5.html"&gt;Hebrews 10:5&lt;/a&gt;, "When Christ came into the world, he said: 'Sacrifice and offering you did not desire, but a body you prepared for me.'" Without the incarnation, Christ could not truly die, and the significance of the cross would be meaningless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the incarnation of Christ is crucial for Christians because it reveals the depths of God's love and mercy towards humanity. Through the incarnation, God became fully human in Jesus Christ, experiencing all that we experience while remaining fully divine. This allows us to have a personal relationship with God and find hope in our struggles, knowing that Jesus understands our human condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the incarnation demonstrates God's commitment to fulfilling his promises and providing salvation to humanity. Jesus' birth under the law and his sacrificial death on the cross are central to the Christian faith. By taking on human flesh, Jesus became the perfect sacrifice who paid the price for our sins and reconciled us with God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The incarnation challenges us to reflect on our own lives and how we relate to Jesus as both fully human and fully divine. It reminds us that Jesus' humanity means he can empathize with our weaknesses and understand our struggles. We can approach him with confidence, knowing that he experienced life on earth just like we do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, considering the purpose of the incarnation should inspire us to live in gratitude and obedience to God. Jesus willingly took on human form to fulfill God's plan for our salvation. This should motivate us to respond with love, obedience, and a desire to share the good news of Christ's incarnation with others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, the incarnation of Christ is a foundational belief in Christianity that affirms Jesus' humanity. It emphasizes that Jesus, the Son of God, took on human flesh to fulfill the law and offer himself as a sacrificial payment for our sins. Understanding the incarnation deepens our appreciation for God's love and mercy towards humanity and calls us to respond with gratitude and obedience.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Jesus Christ/The Nature of Jesus/Humanity"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>'Fully God Fully Man: Understanding the Divine-Human Nature of Jesus'</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/fully-god-fully-man/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-08-24T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-08-24T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-08-24:/fully-god-fully-man/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Fully God, Fully Man: Understanding the Nature of Jesus&lt;/h2&gt;

Let's …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Fully God, Fully Man: Understanding the Nature of Jesus&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nature of Jesus Christ is a central doctrine in Christianity that reveals His dual nature as both fully God and fully man. This concept, known as the hypostatic union, presents Jesus as transcending the ordinary boundaries of human existence. Let's explore this profound mystery and its significance for believers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Hypostatic Union: Fully God, Fully Man&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The term "hypostatic union" expresses the belief that Jesus has two distinct natures—divine and human—united in one person without confusion, change, division, or separation. This doctrine was articulated by the Council of Chalcedon in AD 451. However, it remains an unfathomable mystery that stretches the limits of human comprehension.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus' humanity is evident in the New Testament, which presents Him as a historical figure who experienced the full range of human existence. He was born in Bethlehem and raised in Nazareth. He faced physical limitations, emotions, and temptations just like any other human being. Jesus felt hunger, thirst, fatigue, and sorrow. He showed compassion to those in need and experienced the pain of betrayal. In His humanity, Jesus is a perfect representation of what it means to be human.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While fully human, Jesus is also fully divine. He claimed divine authority, forgave sins, performed miracles, and accepted worship. The New Testament describes Him as the eternal Word of God who became flesh and is referred to as "Immanuel," meaning "God with us." His divine nature includes attributes such as omnipotence, omniscience, and perfection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Significance of the Incarnation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The incarnation—the act of God becoming flesh—is of overwhelming theological significance for believers. Because Jesus has a dual nature, He serves as the perfect mediator between God and humanity. As fully God, He possesses the divine authority to redeem humanity from sin, conquer death, and reconcile us with God. As fully man, He identifies with our struggles and sympathizes with our weaknesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus is the sacrificial lamb for our sins. Through His life, death, and resurrection, He secured salvation for all who believe in Him. In Jesus, we witness the fullest expression of God's character and nature. His teachings reveal the heart of God—a heart full of grace and truth. His divine authority gives weight to His teachings, while His human nature makes them relatable and applicable to our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EtoevOdB7m0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Understanding the dual nature of Jesus is crucial for Christians because it shapes our understanding of who He is and what He accomplished through His life, death, and resurrection. Recognizing Jesus as fully God assures us of His divine power to save and redeem us. At the same time, recognizing Jesus as fully man assures us that He understands our struggles and can empathize with us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This doctrine also underscores the uniqueness of Christianity among other religions. In no other faith do we find a divine being becoming fully human to bridge the gap between humanity and God. The incarnation demonstrates God's radical love for humanity and His desire to be in relationship with us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contemplating the dual nature of Jesus should lead us to approach Him with humility and reverence. It should cause us to give thanks for the incredible love that prompted God to become human for our sake. As we explore this divine mystery, let us embrace the wonder of who Jesus is rather than attempting to reduce Him to a mere human, prophet, or moral teacher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paradoxical nature of Jesus being fully God and fully man calls us to a deeper faith in the wisdom of God. It reminds us that His ways are higher than ours, and His thoughts are higher than our thoughts. Embracing this mystery invites us into a deeper relationship with Jesus, allowing Him to transform our lives through His divine power and understanding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;In Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The doctrine of the hypostatic union reveals the profound truth that Jesus is both fully God and fully man. This mystery lies at the heart of Christian faith and shapes our understanding of Jesus' identity and work. Through His dual nature, Jesus serves as the perfect mediator between God and humanity, securing salvation for all who believe in Him. As we contemplate this divine mystery, may we be filled with awe and gratitude for the incredible love of our Savior, Jesus Christ.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Jesus Christ/The Nature of Jesus/God and Man"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>'God with Us: The Ultimate Guide to Understanding His Presence'</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/god-with-us/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-08-22T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-08-22T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-08-22:/god-with-us/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;God with Us&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept of "God with us" is a central theme in Christianity, particularly when referring to the birth of Jesus.

&lt;h3&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept of "God with us" is a central theme in Christianity, particularly when referring to the birth of Jesus. The phrase "God with us" originates from the prophecy of Isaiah, where it was foretold that a virgin would conceive and give birth to a son who would be called Immanuel, meaning "God with us." This prophecy was fulfilled in the birth of Jesus, who is understood by Christians to be God in human form. The purpose of Jesus coming to earth was to reconcile humanity to God and offer salvation through his sacrificial death and resurrection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Miracle of the Incarnation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The miracle of the Incarnation refers to God taking on human flesh and becoming one of us. This is seen as the ultimate expression of God's love for humanity. In the Old Testament, God's presence was evident in various forms, such as the pillar of cloud above the tabernacle and the voice of the prophets. However, through Jesus, God was present with His people in a more personal and tangible way. Jesus is recognized as Immanuel, fulfilling the prophecy of Isaiah and demonstrating that God truly is with us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FEyRoj2sFc4" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Jesus as God with Us&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus is not just a symbol of God's presence; he is God with us in person. In the Gospel of John, it is stated that the Word (a reference to Jesus) was with God and was God Himself. Jesus became flesh and dwelt among us, revealing the glory, grace, and truth of God. When Philip asked Jesus to show them the Father, Jesus responded by saying that anyone who had seen Him had seen the Father. Jesus perfectly represented God's character and nature in everything He said and did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Purpose of the Incarnation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purpose of Jesus' incarnation was to reconcile humanity to God. The Bible teaches that all people have sinned and are separated from God. However, through Jesus, God offered a way for humanity to be reconciled to Him. Jesus came to pay the price for our sins through His death on the cross, taking upon Himself the punishment that we deserved. Through faith in Jesus and His sacrificial work, we can be forgiven and have eternal life with God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;God with Us Through the Holy Spirit&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Jesus' resurrection and ascension, He promised to send the Holy Spirit as another Helper who would be with believers forever. The Holy Spirit continues the role of Jesus as God with us. The Spirit dwells in the lives of believers, guiding, teaching, and empowering them. The presence of the Holy Spirit is a tangible manifestation of God's ongoing presence in the lives of believers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding and embracing the concept of "God with us" has significant implications for believers. It reminds us of God's love for humanity and His desire to have a relationship with us. It reassures us that we are never alone or abandoned because God is always with us through His Son, Jesus, and the Holy Spirit. Recognizing God's presence in our lives can bring comfort, guidance, and strength in times of difficulty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reflecting on the truth that God is with us can transform our perspective on life. Instead of feeling overwhelmed or hopeless, we can find peace and assurance in knowing that the Creator of the universe is intimately involved in our lives. The reality of "God with us" should inspire us to live in a way that honors and reflects His presence in our lives. It should also motivate us to share this good news with others so that they too can experience the transformative power of God's presence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, "God with us" refers to the reality of God's presence among His people, specifically through the incarnation of Jesus Christ and the indwelling of the Holy Spirit. Jesus is recognized as Immanuel, fulfilling the prophecy of Isaiah and revealing the love and grace of God to humanity. Understanding and embracing the truth of "God with us" has profound implications for believers, providing comfort, guidance, and hope in all circumstances. It reminds us of God's desire to have a personal relationship with us and calls us to live in a way that reflects His presence in our lives.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Jesus Christ/The Nature of Jesus/The Deity of Christ"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>'I AM: Discovering the Ultimate Truth in Christian Faith'</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/i-am/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-08-15T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-08-15T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-08-15:/i-am/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;The Meaning of "I AM": Understanding Jesus' Statement&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Introduction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Introduction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Bible, Jesus often referred to Himself using the phrase "I AM." This statement holds significant meaning and reveals important truths about His identity. Understanding the context and implications of Jesus' use of "I AM" helps us grasp the depth of His divinity and purpose. In this article, we will explore the meaning of Jesus' declaration and how it relates to our faith as Christians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1. The Significance of "I AM"&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Jesus said "I AM," He was using a specific phrase that carries profound theological implications. By using these words, Jesus was intentionally drawing a connection to God's self-revelation in the Old Testament. In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Exodus/3/Exodus-3-14.html"&gt;Exodus 3:14&lt;/a&gt;, God revealed His name to Moses as "I AM WHO I AM." Thus, when Jesus claimed to be the "I AM," He was asserting His divine nature and identifying Himself with Yahweh, the God of Israel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the significance of Jesus' use of "I AM" helps us recognize His divine authority and identity as God incarnate. It affirms our belief in Jesus as the Son of God and strengthens our faith in His teachings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Think About It:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider the impact of Jesus' assertion on those who heard Him speak. How would you have responded if you were present when Jesus made this statement?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2. The Bread of Life: "I AM the Bread of Life"&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/6/John-6-35.html"&gt;John 6:35&lt;/a&gt;, Jesus declared, "I am the bread of life; whoever comes to me shall not hunger, and whoever believes in me shall never thirst." By identifying Himself as the bread of life, Jesus emphasized His role in providing spiritual sustenance for humanity. Just as bread nourishes our physical bodies, Jesus offers Himself as the source of eternal life and satisfaction for our souls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus' statement invites us to come to Him, partake of His teachings, and find fulfillment in our relationship with Him. Through faith in Jesus, we receive the sustenance needed to experience true life and have our spiritual hunger satisfied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recognizing Jesus as the bread of life reminds us of our dependence on Him for spiritual nourishment and fulfillment. It encourages us to seek a deeper relationship with Him, knowing that only He can truly satisfy the longings of our hearts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Think About It:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reflect on how Jesus' statement challenges the cultural emphasis on material possessions and worldly pursuits. How does recognizing Jesus as the bread of life reshape your priorities?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;3. Light of the World: "I AM the Light of the World"&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/8/John-8-12.html"&gt;John 8:12&lt;/a&gt;, Jesus proclaimed, "I am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will not walk in darkness but will have the light of life." Jesus' claim to be the light of the world signifies His role as the source of truth, guidance, and salvation. Just as light dispels darkness, Jesus brings illumination to our lives by revealing God's truth and leading us out of spiritual darkness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XygxFVZ1HNE" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By following Jesus, we are no longer lost in the darkness of sin and ignorance. Instead, we walk in the light of His teachings and experience His transforming power in our lives. The light of Christ enables us to discern right from wrong, navigate life's challenges, and live according to God's will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding Jesus as the light of the world helps us recognize His role as our guide, illuminating the path we should walk. It reminds us to seek His truth and follow His teachings in a world filled with moral confusion and spiritual darkness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Think About It:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider how Jesus' claim to be the light of the world impacts your understanding of truth and morality. How does it influence your decision-making process?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;4. The Door: "I AM the Door"&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/10/John-10-9.html"&gt;John 10:9&lt;/a&gt;, Jesus declared, "I am the door. If anyone enters by me, he will be saved and will go in and out and find pasture." This metaphorical statement highlights Jesus' role as the exclusive entry point to salvation and eternal life. Just as a door provides access to a house, Jesus is the gateway to a restored relationship with God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By acknowledging Jesus as the door, we acknowledge that salvation cannot be attained through any other means. Only through faith in Jesus can we enter into a personal relationship with God, receiving forgiveness of sins and the assurance of eternal life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recognizing Jesus as the door to salvation reinforces our belief in the exclusivity of Christ's redemptive work. It encourages us to place our trust in Him alone for salvation and to share this truth with others who may be seeking meaning and purpose in life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Think About It:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider how Jesus' claim to be the door challenges the prevailing notion of religious pluralism. How does it shape your understanding of salvation?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;5. The Good Shepherd: "I AM the Good Shepherd"&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/10/John-10-11.html"&gt;John 10:11&lt;/a&gt;, Jesus proclaimed, "I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep." By identifying Himself as the good shepherd, Jesus emphasizes His sacrificial love and care for His followers. He contrasts Himself with hired shepherds who may abandon or neglect their sheep when faced with danger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus' role as the good shepherd assures us that He intimately knows and cares for His flock. He leads us, protects us from harm, and willingly laid down His life to save us from sin and death. As our shepherd, Jesus guides us on the path of righteousness and provides everything we need for abundant life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding Jesus as the good shepherd offers comfort and assurance in knowing that we are not alone in our journey of faith. It reminds us of His unconditional love and commitment to our well-being, even in the midst of life's challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Think About It:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reflect on how Jesus' claim to be the good shepherd challenges our tendency to rely on ourselves for guidance and protection. How does it shape your trust in Him?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;6. The Resurrection and the Life: "I AM the Resurrection and the Life"&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/11/John-11-25.html"&gt;John 11:25&lt;/a&gt;, Jesus declared, "I am the resurrection and the life. Whoever believes in me, though he die, yet shall he live." By asserting Himself as the resurrection and the life, Jesus reveals His power over death and offers hope to all who believe in Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through His death and resurrection, Jesus conquered sin and broke the power of death. He promises eternal life to those who put their faith in Him, assuring us that physical death is not the end but a transition into everlasting life with Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recognizing Jesus as the resurrection and the life instills hope and confidence in our own resurrection and eternal destiny. It assures us that death has been defeated through Christ's work on the cross, bringing comfort to those grieving the loss of loved ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Think About It:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contemplate the significance of Jesus' claim to be the resurrection and the life in light of your own mortality. How does it shape your perspective on death and eternity?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding Jesus' use of "I AM" reveals profound truths about His nature and purpose. By claiming to be the bread of life, the light of the world, the door, the good shepherd, and the resurrection and the life, Jesus emphasizes His divine identity, redemptive mission, and offer of salvation. These statements invite us to explore a deeper relationship with Him, placing our trust in Him alone for our spiritual nourishment, guidance, protection, and eternal life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Christians, may we continually reflect on the significance of Jesus' "I AM" statements, allowing them to shape our faith, inform our worldview, and inspire us to share the Good News with others.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Jesus Christ/The Nature of Jesus/The Deity of Christ"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>'Discover the Power of the Good God Alone: A Christian Journey'</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/good-god-alone/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-08-14T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-08-14T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-08-14:/good-god-alone/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Good Alone: Understanding Jesus' Claim to Divinity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Gospel of Mark, there is a passage that has been sometimes misunderstood and used to argue against the deity of Christ. In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/10/Mark-10-17.html"&gt;Mark 10:17-22&lt;/a&gt;, Jesus engages in a conversation with a rich young ruler who addresses Him as "Good …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Good Alone: Understanding Jesus' Claim to Divinity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Gospel of Mark, there is a passage that has been sometimes misunderstood and used to argue against the deity of Christ. In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/10/Mark-10-17.html"&gt;Mark 10:17-22&lt;/a&gt;, Jesus engages in a conversation with a rich young ruler who addresses Him as "Good Teacher." Some claim that Jesus' response denies His divinity. However, upon closer examination, we can see that Jesus is not denying His deity but rather challenging the man to consider the true meaning of goodness and recognize Jesus' divine identity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Understanding Jesus' Response&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the young ruler addresses Jesus as "Good Teacher," Jesus responds with a question, "Why do you call me good? No one is good except God alone" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/10/Mark-10-18.html"&gt;Mark 10:18&lt;/a&gt;). Jesus is not rebuking the man for calling Him good; rather, He is prompting him to consider the implications of his own words. Jesus wants the man to understand what it truly means for someone to be good and recognize his own lack of goodness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus' question highlights that goodness does not originate from human deeds but from God Himself. The young ruler had devoted himself to keeping the commandments, yet he failed to prioritize the greatest commandment—to love God above all else (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/22/Matthew-22-37.html"&gt;Matthew 22:37-38&lt;/a&gt;). The man's attachment to his riches revealed that he valued them more than God, thus falling short of true goodness in God's eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Following Christ: The Path to Goodness&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus uses this encounter to teach an important lesson about goodness. He invites the man to follow Him, emphasizing that true goodness can only be achieved by aligning oneself with God's ultimate standard. Following Jesus means being willing to give up everything and putting God first. By distinguishing between man's standard of goodness and God's standard, Jesus reveals that following Him is a manifestation of true goodness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The command to follow Christ is a proclamation of Jesus' own goodness. By accepting the call to follow Him, one acknowledges Jesus' divine identity. This interpretation aligns with passages such as &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/10/John-10-11.html"&gt;John 10:11&lt;/a&gt;, where Jesus refers to Himself as the "good shepherd." Furthermore, in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/8/John-8-46.html"&gt;John 8:46&lt;/a&gt;, Jesus challenges anyone to prove Him guilty of sin—a challenge that cannot be met since Jesus was without sin, holy, and undefiled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Logic of Jesus' Claim to Divinity&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZOargNFiDd4" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can summarize the logic behind Jesus' claim to divinity as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jesus asserts that only God is good.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jesus claims to be good.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Therefore, Jesus is implicitly claiming to be God.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This reasoning makes sense when we consider the overall narrative in Mark's gospel, which gradually reveals Jesus' true identity. It is only before the high priest in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/14/Mark-14-62.html"&gt;Mark 14:62&lt;/a&gt; that Jesus' identity is explicitly clarified. The story of the rich young ruler is part of a sequence of stories designed to point readers towards the understanding that Jesus is the eternal, divine, incarnate Son of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding Jesus' claim to divinity has significant implications for our faith. Jesus' divinity is a foundational belief in Christianity. By recognizing His divine nature, we affirm His authority and the unique salvation He offers. It also shapes our understanding of what it means to follow Christ and strive for true goodness in our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus' question to the rich young ruler challenges us as well. Are we willing to evaluate our own understanding of goodness? Do we prioritize God above all else? Reflecting on these questions can help us deepen our relationship with God and align our lives with His standards of goodness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, while some may interpret Jesus' response to the rich young ruler as a denial of His divinity, a closer examination reveals that He is actually prompting the man to consider true goodness and recognize Jesus' divine identity. By accepting the call to follow Him, we acknowledge Jesus' claim to be the embodiment of goodness and implicitly affirm His deity. This understanding is crucial for our faith and shapes our understanding of what it means to be a follower of Christ.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Jesus Christ/The Nature of Jesus/The Deity of Christ"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>'Emmanuel: God in the Flesh - The Ultimate Revelation of Divine Presence'</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/god-in-the-flesh/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-08-10T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-08-10T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-08-10:/god-in-the-flesh/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;God in the Flesh&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Christianity, the concept of God in the flesh refers to the belief that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, came to earth as a human being while still maintaining His divine nature. This belief is rooted in the biblical accounts of Jesus' birth, life, death, and resurrection. The idea of God taking on human form is a central aspect of Christian theology and has profound implications for believers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Prophecies and Birth of Jesus&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hundreds of years before Jesus was born, the prophet Isaiah foretold His coming. &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/9/Isaiah-9-6.html"&gt;Isaiah 9:6&lt;/a&gt; states, "For to us a child is born, to us a son is given, and the government will be on his shoulders. And he will be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace." This prophecy describes the Messiah who would come to bring salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The angel who appeared to Joseph confirmed that Mary's child was indeed the Son of God. The angel referred to Isaiah's prophecy when he said, "The virgin will conceive and give birth to a son, and they will call him Immanuel (which means 'God with us')" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/1/Matthew-1-23.html"&gt;Matthew 1:23&lt;/a&gt;). This reveals that Jesus' identity is "God with us," indicating His divine nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Jesus' Identity&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout His ministry, Jesus questioned His disciples about His identity. In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/16/Matthew-16-13.html"&gt;Matthew 16:13-15&lt;/a&gt;, He asked them, "Who do people say that I am?" Their answers varied, reflecting the different opinions held by people at the time. However, when Jesus asked His disciples directly, Peter answered, "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/16/Matthew-16-16.html"&gt;Matthew 16:16&lt;/a&gt;). Jesus affirmed Peter's response as the truth upon which He would build His church.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus Himself declared His divinity on multiple occasions. In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/14/John-14-9.html"&gt;John 14:9-10&lt;/a&gt;, He said, "Anyone who has seen me has seen the Father. How can you say, 'Show us the Father'? Don't you believe that I am in the Father, and that the Father is in me? The words I say to you I do not speak on my own authority. Rather, it is the Father, living in me, who is doing his work." This statement emphasizes the unity of Jesus with God the Father.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Nature of Jesus Christ&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bible clearly teaches that Jesus possesses both a divine nature and a human nature. In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/1/John-1-1.html"&gt;John 1:1-14&lt;/a&gt;, Jesus is referred to as the Word who became flesh and dwelt among us. This passage confirms that Jesus is both fully God and fully man. &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Philippians/2/Philippians-2-6.html"&gt;Philippians 2:6-7&lt;/a&gt; further explains that although Jesus was in very nature God, He humbled Himself and took on the nature of a servant, being made in human likeness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Colossians/2/Colossians-2-9.html"&gt;Colossians 2:9&lt;/a&gt; affirms that "in Christ all the fullness of the Deity lives in bodily form." This verse emphasizes that Jesus possesses the complete essence of God within His physical body. The incarnation of Jesus as both fully divine and fully human is essential to understanding His mission on earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hNznHSSxjNo" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The Sinless Sacrifice&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus' sinless nature is significant because it qualified Him to be the perfect sacrifice for humanity's sins. Unlike every other person born into the world, Jesus did not inherit a sin nature. He was born of a virgin, conceived by the Holy Spirit, and therefore did not possess the sinful nature passed down from Adam (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/5/Romans-5-12.html"&gt;Romans 5:12&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As stated in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/2/Hebrews-2-14.html"&gt;Hebrews 2:14-18&lt;/a&gt; and 4:15, Jesus was tempted like any human being but never sinned. His sinlessness allowed Him to fulfill all the requirements of a holy God and become an acceptable sacrifice for our sins. Sin entered the world through Adam, but Jesus, being born without a sin nature, was able to offer Himself as the perfect sacrifice to redeem humanity (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/9/Hebrews-9-14.html"&gt;Hebrews 9:14&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Importance of Jesus' Incarnation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The incarnation of Jesus is of utmost importance in Christianity because it reveals God's plan to reconcile humanity to Himself. Since the fall of man, the only way to be made right with God has been through the blood of an innocent sacrifice. Jesus, being both fully God and fully man, became the final and perfect sacrifice that satisfied God's judgment against sin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus' death and resurrection accomplished victory over sin and death for all who put their trust in Him. Through His sacrifice, He provided salvation and eternal life (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/1/John-1-12.html"&gt;John 1:12&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-Corinthians/15/1-Corinthians-15-3.html"&gt;1 Corinthians 15:3-4&lt;/a&gt;, 17). If Jesus were merely a good man with a sin nature, His death and resurrection would have no power to save anyone. It is His divine nature and sinless sacrifice that make Him the only way to salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding Jesus as God in the flesh has profound implications for believers. It means that God Himself entered into human history to provide a way for humanity to be reconciled with Him. It demonstrates God's love, mercy, and desire for a relationship with His creation. Jesus' incarnation also reveals the depth of God's commitment to redeeming humanity and the lengths He was willing to go to accomplish it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recognizing Jesus' dual nature helps believers grasp the significance of His sacrifice on the cross. It highlights the uniqueness of Christianity compared to other religions or belief systems. The incarnation affirms that Jesus is not just a moral teacher or prophet but the very Son of God who willingly laid down His life for our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept of God in the flesh challenges us to consider the magnitude of who Jesus is. It invites us to reflect on our own understanding of His identity and the implications it has for our faith. Recognizing Jesus as both fully God and fully man calls us to surrender our lives to Him, acknowledging His lordship and accepting the salvation He offers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Considering Jesus' sinless sacrifice also prompts us to examine our own lives and the need for redemption. It reminds us of the seriousness of sin and the immense price paid for our forgiveness. Understanding the incarnation should lead us to respond with gratitude, worship, and a desire to live in obedience to God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, according to Christian belief, Jesus Christ is God in the flesh. This truth is revealed through the prophecies of His birth, His own declaration of His identity, and the biblical teachings on His nature. Jesus' sinless sacrifice and His victory over sin and death provide salvation for all who believe in Him. Understanding Jesus as both fully divine and fully human has significant implications for believers and calls us to respond with faith, gratitude, and a desire to live according to His teachings.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Jesus Christ/The Nature of Jesus/God and Man"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>"Unveiling the Supreme Reign of Christ: A Christian's Ultimate Guide"</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/supremacy-of-christ/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-08-10T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-08-10T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-08-10:/supremacy-of-christ/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;The Supremacy of Christ&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The supremacy of Christ is a fundamental Christian doctrine that affirms the authority and divinity of Jesus. In simple terms, to believe in the supremacy of Christ is to acknowledge that Jesus is God. The word "supreme" means "highest in rank or authority" or "highest in …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;The Supremacy of Christ&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The supremacy of Christ is a fundamental Christian doctrine that affirms the authority and divinity of Jesus. In simple terms, to believe in the supremacy of Christ is to acknowledge that Jesus is God. The word "supreme" means "highest in rank or authority" or "highest in degree or quality." It signifies that there is no one greater. Jesus is the ultimate in power, glory, authority, and importance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Jesus' Supremacy in Hebrews&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book of Hebrews emphasizes the work of Jesus in relation to the Old Testament system. It explains that Jesus is not just a new way of doing things; He is supreme and surpasses the old ways. The author of Hebrews compares Jesus to the temple system under the Mosaic Law, stating that Jesus' ministry is superior to theirs. The new covenant established by Jesus is based on better promises (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/8/Hebrews-8-6.html"&gt;Hebrews 8:6&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, Hebrews highlights that Jesus is not only superior to roles and systems but also to creation itself. He is described as the radiance of God's glory and the exact representation of His being, sustaining all things by His powerful word (Hebrews 1:3a). This demonstrates that Jesus is not just a man but God Himself. His supremacy extends over all creation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Supremacy of Christ in Colossians&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Colossians/1/Colossians-1-15.html"&gt;Colossians 1:15&lt;/a&gt;–23, often referred to as "The Supremacy of Christ," emphasizes that Jesus is above all things. He is called "the image of the invisible God" and "the firstborn over all creation" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Colossians/1/Colossians-1-15.html"&gt;Colossians 1:15&lt;/a&gt;). The term "firstborn" does not imply that Christ was created but rather signifies a position of authority. Paul goes on to explain that all things were created through Jesus and for Him (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Colossians/1/Colossians-1-16.html"&gt;Colossians 1:16&lt;/a&gt;). This establishes Jesus as the Creator and affirms His divinity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul further states that Jesus is before all things, holds all things together, and is the head of the Church. He is supreme over creation, death, and every aspect of life (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Colossians/1/Colossians-1-17.html"&gt;Colossians 1:17&lt;/a&gt;–18). Jesus' authority is all-encompassing, making Him unique and above all else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Significance of Jesus' Supremacy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the supremacy of Christ is essential for our view of and worship of Him. It confirms that Jesus is fully God, not just a man or a moral teacher. His sacrifice on the cross for our sins is sufficient because He is infinite and able to atone for our infinite offense against God. The supremacy of Christ also refutes the idea that there are multiple paths to God. Jesus is not just one option among many; He is the only way to salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VeKgfUGtcI0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, Jesus' supremacy reveals that we cannot rely on our own works or efforts to save ourselves. The Old Testament sacrificial system was unable to take away sins. Jesus fulfilled and replaced that system, making salvation a gift by grace through faith (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Ephesians/2/Ephesians-2-1.html"&gt;Ephesians 2:1&lt;/a&gt;–10). Our transformation into Christlikeness is only possible through the work of the Holy Spirit, not by our own strength.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The supremacy of Christ also establishes His authority over angels. He created them and is superior to them (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/1/Hebrews-1-4.html"&gt;Hebrews 1:4&lt;/a&gt;). This refutes any inclination towards angel worship. Furthermore, recognizing Jesus' authority over both the physical and spiritual realms helps us maintain a proper perspective on creation. We are called to worship Jesus alone and not creation itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the supremacy of Christ has significant implications for our faith and relationship with God. It shapes our understanding of who Jesus is, the depth of His love for us, and His sufficiency for our salvation. By acknowledging His supremacy, we acknowledge His divinity and recognize Him as the ultimate authority in our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does recognizing the supremacy of Christ impact your view of Jesus?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In what ways does the supremacy of Christ challenge the idea of multiple paths to God?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does understanding Jesus' authority over creation and the spiritual realm affect your worship and perspective on the world?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, the supremacy of Christ is a foundational Christian doctrine that affirms the authority and divinity of Jesus. It is supported by biblical passages in Hebrews and Colossians, which emphasize that Jesus is supreme over all creation, systems, and roles. Recognizing Jesus' supremacy has profound implications for our faith and relationship with God, shaping our understanding of salvation, worship, and our identity as believers.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Jesus Christ/The Nature of Jesus/The Deity of Christ"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>'Understanding Miaphysitism vs. Dyophysitism: Unveiling the Christian Doctrinal Debate'</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/miaphysitism-dyophysitism/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-08-06T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-08-06T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-08-06:/miaphysitism-dyophysitism/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Miaphysitism and Dyophysitism: Understanding the Nature of Jesus&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The nature of Jesus as both God and man is a fundamental aspect of Christian theology. Two terms often used to describe different perspectives on this matter are miaphysitism and dyophysitism. These terms help us understand how Jesus can be both fully divine and fully human.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Dyophysitism: Two Natures in One Person&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dyophysitism is the belief that Jesus is one person with two distinct natures: a divine nature and a human nature. The term "dyophysitism" comes from the Greek words "duo," meaning "two," and "physis," meaning "nature." According to this view, Jesus possesses both a fully divine nature and a fully human nature simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This understanding of Jesus' nature was formulated in response to various heretical teachings. For example, Apollinarius, who became bishop of Laodicea in 361, taught that Jesus had a human body but lacked a human mind or spirit. This view was rejected by the Church because it undermined the full humanity of Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Miaphysitism: One Integrated Nature&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Miaphysitism, on the other hand, asserts that Jesus has only one nature that is fully integrated, encompassing both his divinity and humanity. The term "miaphysitism" comes from the Greek words "mia," meaning "one," and "physis," meaning "nature." According to this view, Jesus' nature is not divided or separated into two distinct parts but is a unified whole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to note that miaphysitism does not deny that Jesus is fully God and fully human. Rather, it emphasizes the unity and integration of his divine and human natures into one inseparable whole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Contrasting Views and Historical Background&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To better understand miaphysitism and dyophysitism, it is helpful to contrast them with other views that have emerged throughout Christian history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nestorianism, named after Nestorius, who became bishop of Constantinople in 428, posits that Jesus had two distinct natures to the extent that he was two separate persons. However, this view was rejected because it contradicted the biblical teaching that Jesus is one person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yufkTiXTb3o" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another perspective, known as monophysitism or Eutychianism after Eutyches, a church leader from the late 4th to mid-5th century, argues that Jesus had one nature in which the human nature was fully absorbed by the divine nature. This view suggests that Jesus' nature was more than human but less than divine. Variations of this belief suggest that Jesus' human nature was entirely engulfed by his divine nature. Both these variations undermine the full humanity of Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The orthodox position, which was solidified at the Council of Chalcedon in 451, sought to reconcile all the biblical data. It affirms that Jesus is one person with two natures: fully divine and fully human. This position acknowledges that Jesus exhibits characteristics of both natures in his life and ministry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Implications and Application&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding these different views has implications for how we perceive Christ's work and its significance for humanity. For example, miaphysitism emphasizes the integration of Jesus' divine and human natures. This perspective highlights the importance of recognizing Christ's full humanity, as he becomes an adequate representative of humanity on the cross.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, dyophysitism emphasizes the distinctness of Jesus' divine and human natures. This view emphasizes both Jesus' divinity and his perfect humanity without diminishing either aspect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is worth noting that some non-Chalcedonian churches today adopt miaphysitism while affirming both the full divinity and full humanity of Jesus. They assert that their differences with dyophysitism are primarily semantic and not substantial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters: The Nature of Jesus and Our Faith&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the nature of Jesus is crucial to our Christian faith. It helps us appreciate the depth of God's love and the significance of Jesus' sacrifice on the cross. By being fully divine and fully human, Jesus uniquely bridges the gap between God and humanity, allowing us to be reconciled with God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The distinction between miaphysitism and dyophysitism may seem complex, but it touches on essential aspects of our understanding of who Jesus is and how he relates to us. It is crucial for believers to engage with these theological concepts to deepen their faith and grasp the significance of Jesus' work in salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It: The Mystery of Christ's Nature&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the Bible does not explicitly answer whether Jesus had two natures or one integrated nature, it provides sufficient evidence for both perspectives. As Christians, we should approach these theological questions with humility, recognizing that they touch on profound mysteries beyond our complete comprehension.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We should care deeply about understanding the nature of Christ while avoiding dogmatism where Scripture remains silent. We need to strike a balance between appreciating the complexities involved in these theological positions and holding firm to the clear teachings of Scripture regarding the full divinity and full humanity of Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, miaphysitism and dyophysitism are two terms used to describe different perspectives on the nature of Jesus. Dyophysitism emphasizes that Jesus is one person with two distinct natures: fully divine and fully human. In contrast, miaphysitism emphasizes that Jesus has one integrated nature that encompasses both his divinity and humanity. Both views have historical backgrounds and implications for our understanding of Jesus' work on the cross. While these concepts may seem complex, they are vital for deepening our faith and appreciating the significance of Christ's nature as both fully God and fully man.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Jesus Christ/The Nature of Jesus/God and Man"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Discover the One God of Deuteronomy 6:4 - Unveiling the Ultimate Truth</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/jesus-god-one-deuteronomy-6-4/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-08-03T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-08-03T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-08-03:/jesus-god-one-deuteronomy-6-4/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Jesus, God, and &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Deuteronomy/6/Deuteronomy-6-4.html"&gt;Deuteronomy 6:4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Deuteronomy/6/Deuteronomy-6-4.html"&gt;Deuteronomy 6:4&lt;/a&gt; states, "Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God, the LORD is one." This verse has been foundational in Judaism and is also significant for Christians. However, some may wonder how Christianity reconciles this belief in the oneness of God with the belief that Jesus is also God. In order to understand this, we need to delve into the meaning of &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Deuteronomy/6/Deuteronomy-6-4.html"&gt;Deuteronomy 6:4&lt;/a&gt; and explore the Christian understanding of the Trinity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Meaning of "The LORD is One"&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Deuteronomy/6/Deuteronomy-6-4.html"&gt;Deuteronomy 6:4&lt;/a&gt; says "The LORD is one," it is important to note that the Hebrew word for "one" used here is "echad." This word signifies unity rather than singularity. It is also used in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/2/Genesis-2-24.html"&gt;Genesis 2:24&lt;/a&gt; to describe how a husband and wife become "one" flesh. Clearly, this does not mean they become a singular being. Instead, it emphasizes their unity with each other. Furthermore, it is worth mentioning that there is a Hebrew word that denotes absolute singularity, "yachid," but it is not used in reference to God in the Hebrew Scriptures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, when &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Deuteronomy/6/Deuteronomy-6-4.html"&gt;Deuteronomy 6:4&lt;/a&gt; says "The LORD is one," it affirms the biblical teaching of one God. It does not imply a denial of the possibility of multiple persons within the Godhead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Doctrine of the Trinity&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_DRu1aE4y-s" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Christian belief in Jesus as God does not contradict &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Deuteronomy/6/Deuteronomy-6-4.html"&gt;Deuteronomy 6:4&lt;/a&gt; because Christians understand the one true God to exist in three distinct persons: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. This belief is encapsulated in the doctrine of the Trinity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/28/Matthew-28-19.html"&gt;Matthew 28:19&lt;/a&gt;, Jesus instructs his followers to baptize new disciples in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. This indicates that all three persons are functioning as the same God. Another instance where all three persons of the Trinity are simultaneously present is during the baptism of Jesus. &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/3/Luke-3-21.html"&gt;Luke 3:21-22&lt;/a&gt; recounts how Jesus was baptized, the Holy Spirit descended upon him in the form of a dove, and a voice from heaven declared, "You are my Son, whom I love; with you I am well pleased." This event demonstrates the unity and coexistence of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Deity of Jesus&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each person of the Trinity is referred to as God in the Bible. While the Father is explicitly called God, Jesus is also referred to as God in several passages such as &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/1/John-1-1.html"&gt;John 1:1&lt;/a&gt;; 14; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/9/Romans-9-5.html"&gt;Romans 9:5&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Colossians/2/Colossians-2-9.html"&gt;Colossians 2:9&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/1/Hebrews-1-8.html"&gt;Hebrews 1:8&lt;/a&gt;–9; and &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-John/5/1-John-5-20.html"&gt;1 John 5:20&lt;/a&gt;. Likewise, the Holy Spirit is identified as God in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Acts/5/Acts-5-3.html"&gt;Acts 5:3&lt;/a&gt;–4 and &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-Corinthians/3/1-Corinthians-3-16.html"&gt;1 Corinthians 3:16&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some may argue that God cannot have a Son in the traditional sense of human procreation. However, the Father/Son relationship within the Trinity is not about biological birth but rather serves as a metaphor to help us grasp the inner workings of the Trinity. The Son and the Holy Spirit have existed eternally alongside the Father, enjoying perfect fellowship within the Trinity. In this way, God exists in both perfect unity and community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the relationship between Jesus and God is crucial for Christians because it shapes our understanding of salvation and our relationship with God. If Jesus is not truly God, then his sacrifice on the cross would not have been sufficient to atone for our sins. However, if Jesus is indeed God, then his death and resurrection hold tremendous significance for our redemption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept of the Trinity can be complex and challenging to fully comprehend. Yet, it reveals the depth and richness of God's nature. Just as a husband and wife can be united in marriage while still maintaining their individual identities, so too can the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit exist as distinct persons while being united in the Godhead. The Trinity illustrates the perfect love and unity that exists within God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Christians, we can find comfort and assurance in knowing that our salvation is secure because Jesus, as both fully human and fully divine, has accomplished our redemption. Embracing this truth deepens our relationship with God and enables us to experience the fullness of his love and grace.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Jesus Christ/The Nature of Jesus/The Deity of Christ"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>The Ultimate Guide to Understanding Incarnation Immutability in Christian Doctrine</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/incarnation-immutability/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-07-17T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-07-17T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-07-17:/incarnation-immutability/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Incarnation Immutability&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The concept of the incarnation immutability is a theological topic that has been debated and discussed by many great minds throughout history. It involves understanding the nature of Jesus Christ, particularly in relation to his divine and human natures. In order to grasp this complex concept, we must refer to the affirmations of Scripture and examine the teachings of early theologians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus' Divinity and Humanity:
The Bible clearly affirms both the divinity and humanity of Jesus Christ. Various passages explicitly assert his divinity, such as &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/1/John-1-1.html"&gt;John 1:1&lt;/a&gt;, while others imply it through his divine actions like forgiving sins and creating the cosmos. On the other hand, scriptural evidence also demonstrates Jesus' humanity, as he experienced suffering, death, and weaknesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Incarnation:
When the "Word became flesh" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/1/John-1-14.html"&gt;John 1:14&lt;/a&gt;), Jesus did not become two separate beings (one divine and one human), but rather one person with two distinct natures - fully divine and fully human. This union of God's nature with sinless human nature took place without any changes to His divine nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Immutability of Jesus' Divine Nature:
Jesus' divine nature is unchanging, infinite, and ever-supreme in every way. As God, He is immutable and perfect, incapable of degrading into a worse state or improving into a better state. There is no room for improvement or change in God's perfection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aBwex8Ul1mk" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Changeability of Jesus' Human Nature:
In contrast to His divine nature, Jesus' human nature is changeable and subject to weakness. As a human being, He was able to suffer, die, and experience limitations both physically and emotionally. We see evidence of this in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/2/Luke-2-52.html"&gt;Luke 2:52&lt;/a&gt; where it states that Jesus "grew in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and men."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Mystery of the Incarnation:
The fourth and fifth-century theologians grappled with the challenge of explaining the full extent of the Incarnation. While they couldn't fully comprehend or explain it, they affirmed what Scripture taught about Jesus being both human and divine. They acknowledged that aspects of the Incarnation are a mysterious wonder, but they avowed what God had revealed to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Significance of the Incarnation:
The mystery of the Incarnation holds great significance for our salvation. Jesus Christ, as God incarnate, serves as the perfect mediator between humanity and God. As God, He perfectly represents God to us, and as a human, He serves as our advocate before God the Father. Through His sacrificial death and resurrection, He makes peace on our behalf and offers forgiveness for our sins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt;
Understanding the concept of incarnation immutability is essential for Christians because it helps us grasp the fullness of who Jesus Christ is - both fully divine and fully human. This understanding enables us to appreciate the significance of His sacrifice on the cross and His role as our mediator with God. It also reminds us of the depth of God's love for us, that He would enter into our human experience to bring about our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt;
Reflecting on the mystery of the Incarnation can deepen our awe and gratitude towards God. Consider how Jesus' simultaneous divinity and humanity impact your understanding of His teachings and actions in the Gospels. How does this knowledge influence your relationship with Him and your appreciation for His sacrifice on your behalf?&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Jesus Christ/The Nature of Jesus/Humanity"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>'Ultimate Revelation: God and Jesus - One Divine Entity Revealed'</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/god-jesus-same-person/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-07-15T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-07-15T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-07-15:/god-jesus-same-person/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Are God and Jesus the Same Person?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question of whether God and Jesus are the same person is a complex one that depends on how we understand the term "same person." In a theological sense, it is important to recognize that Jesus and God the Father are different persons …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Are God and Jesus the Same Person?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question of whether God and Jesus are the same person is a complex one that depends on how we understand the term "same person." In a theological sense, it is important to recognize that Jesus and God the Father are different persons within the Trinity. While they share the same divine nature and essence, they have distinct personhood. However, if the question means to ask if Jesus is truly God or if He is God in human form, then the answer is a resounding "Yes!" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Colossians/2/Colossians-2-9.html"&gt;Colossians 2:9&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Trinity: One God in Three Persons&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To understand this concept more clearly, let's delve into the doctrine of the Trinity. The Trinity teaches that there is only one God who exists in three co-equal and co-eternal persons: God the Father, God the Son (Jesus), and God the Holy Spirit. These three persons share the same essence or nature but are distinct from one another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Modalism and Trinitarianism&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is essential to address a heresy called modalism (and its modern variation called Oneness theology) that denies the existence of three Persons within the Trinity. Modalism teaches that God reveals Himself in different modes or forms, such as the Father, Son, or Holy Spirit. According to this view, Jesus and God the Father would be considered the same person. However, Trinitarians reject this perspective and maintain that Jesus and God the Father are distinct persons within the Trinity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Understanding Jesus as Fully Divine&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lVap2tUPNhQ" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To affirm that Jesus is fully divine, we can turn to passages like &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/1/John-1-1.html"&gt;John 1:1-3&lt;/a&gt;. In these verses, we learn that Jesus, referred to as the Word, was with God in the beginning and was also identified as God. This distinction between Jesus and God emphasizes their separate personhood while affirming Jesus' divine nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the relationship between God and Jesus has significant implications for our faith. Recognizing that Jesus is fully divine helps us grasp the depth of His sacrifice on the cross. If Jesus were not God, His sacrifice would not have been sufficient to atone for our sins. Additionally, acknowledging Jesus' divinity allows us to approach Him with reverence, worship, and trust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider the significance of Jesus being both fully human and fully divine. How does this impact your understanding of His role as our Savior? How does it deepen your appreciation for His sacrifice on the cross?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, while Jesus and God the Father are distinct persons within the Trinity, Jesus is fully divine. He shares the same divine nature as God and is not merely a human being. Understanding this truth is crucial to our understanding of Jesus' role as our Savior and the significance of His sacrifice on the cross.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Jesus Christ/The Nature of Jesus/The Deity of Christ"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>'Unlocking the Divine: 7 Essential Keys to the Kingdom for Christian Empowerment'</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/keys-to-the-kingdom/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-07-06T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-07-06T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-07-06:/keys-to-the-kingdom/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Keys to the Kingdom&lt;/h2&gt;

Similarly, in the New Testament, the term "Hades" has a twofold meaning …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Keys to the Kingdom&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keys serve as symbols of control and access. They grant the holder entry into locked spaces and signify authority. In ancient times, large keys were even seen as a mark of status within communities. Similarly, in the New Testament, the term "Hades" has a twofold meaning: it can refer to the place where all departed souls reside (the grave), or specifically to the place where the wicked are confined (Hell). However, it is important to note that Jesus holds the ultimate power over death and Hades. He alone possesses the "keys" and has authority over these realms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Jesus' Authority over Death and Hades&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus' victory over death is what gives Him control over who enters death and Hades. He has conquered death and emerged from the grave, making Him the sole arbiter of who enters these realms. It is crucial to understand that Satan has never possessed these keys or had any power over who goes to Heaven or Hell. The keys have always belonged to God alone, as stated in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Revelation/1/Revelation-1-18.html"&gt;Revelation 1:18&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Jesus' Triumph on the Cross&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QBQlbdpaV2w" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus did not have to fight Satan for the keys because they were never in Satan's possession. His death on the cross was His ultimate triumph, disarming all powers and authorities. &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Colossians/2/Colossians-2-15.html"&gt;Colossians 2:15&lt;/a&gt; tells us that Jesus "made a public spectacle of them [powers and authorities], triumphing over them by the cross." Through His sacrificial act, Jesus secured victory over sin and death for all believers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Way, the Truth, and the Life&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus declared Himself as the Way, the Truth, and the Life (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/14/John-14-6.html"&gt;John 14:6&lt;/a&gt;). This statement emphasizes that only through Him can individuals come to God the Father. He is the sole path to salvation and eternal life. This assertion underscores the exclusive nature of faith in Christ for attaining access to God's Kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Freedom from Fear&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Christians, there is no need to fear death or Hell. Christ has complete authority over both realms. Those who have faith in Jesus will never enter Hell. This assurance stems from the fact that Jesus holds the keys to the Kingdom and determines who enters it. Believers can find comfort in knowing that their eternal destiny rests in the hands of the One who conquered death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding Jesus' authority over death and Hades has significant implications for our faith. It reminds us that our salvation is secure in Christ alone, and we need not fear the power of death or Satan. Recognizing Jesus as the only way to God also reinforces the exclusivity of Christianity and emphasizes the importance of sharing the Gospel with others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider the significance of Jesus' triumph on the cross. How does His victory over sin and death impact your daily life? Reflect on the assurance and hope that come from knowing that Jesus holds the keys to eternal life. How does this truth shape your perspective on death and eternity?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, the concept of "keys to the kingdom" symbolizes control and access in both ancient societies and biblical texts. Jesus, through His victory on the cross, has authority over death and Hades. Satan has never possessed these keys or had any power over eternal destinies. As Christians, we can rest in the knowledge that our salvation is secure in Christ alone, who is the Way, the Truth, and the Life. Understanding Jesus' authority over death and Hades brings us comfort, confidence, and a renewed sense of purpose in sharing the message of salvation with others.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Jesus Christ/The Nature of Jesus/The Deity of Christ"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Did Jesus Claim to Be God? Unveiling the Truth for Believers</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/did-jesus-say-he-is-god/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-07-01T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-07-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-07-01:/did-jesus-say-he-is-god/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Did Jesus Claim to be God?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

While those exact words may not be found in the Bible, Jesus did make various claims and statements that clearly conveyed His divinity.

&lt;h3&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many people wonder if Jesus explicitly said, "I am God." While those exact words may not be found in the Bible, Jesus did make various claims and statements that clearly conveyed His divinity. In this article, we will explore several instances where Jesus indicated His divine nature and examine the reactions of those who heard Him. Through His words, actions, miracles, and resurrection, Jesus demonstrated His identity as the Son of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Jesus and the Father are One&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/10/John-10-30.html"&gt;John 10:30&lt;/a&gt;, Jesus proclaimed, "I and the Father are one." Although He did not explicitly say, "I am God," this statement left no doubt about His divinity. The Jews who heard Him were well aware of the implications of such a claim and immediately picked up stones to stone Him for blasphemy (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/10/John-10-31.html"&gt;John 10:31&lt;/a&gt;). Their reaction clearly indicates that they understood Jesus to be equating Himself with God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/strong&gt;
Understanding Jesus' claim to be one with the Father is crucial because it reveals His divine nature. It challenges us to acknowledge that Jesus is not just a mere man but God in human form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It&lt;/strong&gt;
Imagine someone today claiming to be one with God. How would people react? How would you respond?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Before Abraham Was, I Am&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/8/John-8-58.html"&gt;John 8:58&lt;/a&gt;, Jesus made another significant statement affirming His deity. He said, "Very truly I tell you... before Abraham was born, I am!" By using the phrase "I am," Jesus intentionally echoed the name of God revealed to Moses in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Exodus/3/Exodus-3-14.html"&gt;Exodus 3:14&lt;/a&gt;. The Jews listening to Him understood that He was claiming preexistence and equating Himself with Yahweh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/strong&gt;
Jesus' use of "I am" reveals His eternal nature and further establishes His claim to be God. It demonstrates that He existed before Abraham and has divine authority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It&lt;/strong&gt;
Why do you think Jesus chose to use the phrase "I am" to describe Himself? What does this say about His relationship with God?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Word Became Flesh&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Gospel of John begins with a profound statement affirming Jesus' deity: "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/1/John-1-1.html"&gt;John 1:1&lt;/a&gt;). Here, John identifies Jesus as the Word who became flesh and dwelt among us (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/1/John-1-14.html"&gt;John 1:14&lt;/a&gt;). This passage emphasizes that Jesus is both fully God and fully human.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/strong&gt;
Recognizing Jesus as the Word made flesh helps us understand that He is not just a great teacher or prophet but God Himself, who took on human form to reveal God's glory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zylfRYiBSr4" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It&lt;/strong&gt;
How does the concept of Jesus being the Word made flesh impact your understanding of His divinity? How does it affect your relationship with Him?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Thomas' Confession&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After His resurrection, Jesus appeared to His disciples, including Thomas. When Thomas saw Jesus, he exclaimed, "My Lord and my God!" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/20/John-20-28.html"&gt;John 20:28&lt;/a&gt;). Rather than correcting Thomas for his declaration, Jesus accepted it. This interaction affirms Jesus' divinity and acknowledges that He is worthy of worship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/strong&gt;
Thomas' confession highlights the importance of recognizing Jesus as both Lord and God. It challenges us to acknowledge Jesus' rightful place in our lives and worship Him as our Savior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It&lt;/strong&gt;
How does Thomas' confession impact your own understanding of who Jesus is? How does it shape your devotion to Him?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Worshiping Jesus&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout His ministry, Jesus received worship from His disciples. For example, when He walked on water, His disciples worshiped Him (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/14/Matthew-14-33.html"&gt;Matthew 14:33&lt;/a&gt;). After His resurrection, they fell at His feet and worshiped Him (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/28/Matthew-28-9.html"&gt;Matthew 28:9&lt;/a&gt;). Jesus never rebuked them for worshiping Him but instead accepted their worship as good and proper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/strong&gt;
The disciples' worship of Jesus demonstrates their recognition of His divinity. It teaches us that worshiping Jesus is not only acceptable but also essential to our faith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It&lt;/strong&gt;
How does the disciples' worship of Jesus inspire your own worship? How does it deepen your understanding of His divinity?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Testimony of Paul and John&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New Testament, through the writings of Paul and John, further affirms Jesus' deity. Paul eagerly awaited the appearing of "our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Titus/2/Titus-2-13.html"&gt;Titus 2:13&lt;/a&gt;). Both Paul and John declare that Jesus is the Creator of the universe (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/1/John-1-3.html"&gt;John 1:3&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Colossians/1/Colossians-1-16.html"&gt;Colossians 1:16&lt;/a&gt;–17). These passages reinforce the understanding that Jesus is God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/strong&gt;
The testimony of Paul and John strengthens our confidence in Jesus' divine nature. It confirms that the early Christians recognized and proclaimed Jesus as God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It&lt;/strong&gt;
How does the testimony of Paul and John enhance your understanding of who Jesus is? How does it impact your faith in Him?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Jesus did not explicitly say, "I am God," He made numerous claims and statements that unmistakably revealed His divine nature. Through His words, actions, miracles, and resurrection, Jesus demonstrated that He is the Son of God. Understanding and accepting Jesus as God is a foundational aspect of the Christian faith. It challenges us to recognize His authority, worship Him, and place our trust in Him as our Savior and Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we reflect on these truths, may we grow in our understanding of who Jesus is and deepen our relationship with Him.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Jesus Christ/The Nature of Jesus/The Deity of Christ"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>'Understanding Jesus Son of Man: Unveiling the Divine Humanity'</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/jesus-son-of-man/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-06-21T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-06-21T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-06-21:/jesus-son-of-man/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Jesus: The Son of Man&lt;/h2&gt;

While other titles for Jesus, such as Son of God, emphasize His deity, Son of Man …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Jesus: The Son of Man&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus is often referred to as the "Son of Man" in the New Testament. This title is used 82 times and was the primary way Jesus referred to Himself. While other titles for Jesus, such as Son of God, emphasize His deity, Son of Man focuses on His humanity. In fact, the phrase "Son of Man" is a term used to describe any human being. However, when applied to Jesus, it carries a significant meaning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus, the Son of Man, is the perfect embodiment of what God intended humanity to be. He is the supreme example of truth and grace. In Him, "all the fullness of the Deity lives in bodily form." (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Colossians/2/Colossians-2-9.html"&gt;Colossians 2:9&lt;/a&gt;) Jesus' incarnation as the Son of Man showcases His humility and willingness to lower Himself from His heavenly glory to identify with humanity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout His life on Earth, Jesus experienced the limitations and struggles of being human. He was born in a humble manger and lived a life without earthly possessions. Jesus associated with sinners, ate and drank with them, and ultimately suffered at the hands of men. This intentional choice to become the Son of Man demonstrates His deep love for humanity and His desire to save us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One significant moment where Jesus referred to Himself as the Son of Man was during His trial before the high priest. He quoted a prophecy from &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Daniel/7/Daniel-7-13.html"&gt;Daniel 7:13-14&lt;/a&gt;, which speaks of a figure who comes with the clouds of heaven and receives dominion, glory, and an everlasting kingdom. By applying this prophecy to Himself, Jesus claimed that He is the Son of Man who will rule over all things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0SOJEyzdg-M" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The Humanity and Deity of Jesus&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus is not only fully human but also fully God. He existed eternally as the Second Person of the Trinity before taking on human flesh. The Gospel of John describes Jesus as the Word who was with God and was God from the beginning. (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/1/John-1-1.html"&gt;John 1:1&lt;/a&gt;) And the same Word became flesh and dwelt among us. (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/1/John-1-14.html"&gt;John 1:14&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The combination of Jesus' humanity and deity is a crucial aspect of Christian theology. It allows Him to fulfill the role of our Savior. As fully human, He can sympathize with our weaknesses and understand our struggles. As fully God, He has the power and authority to forgive sins, execute judgment, and offer eternal salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Role of the Son of Man&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus, as the Son of Man, came with a specific purpose. He came to save lives, rise from the dead, and execute judgment. Throughout His ministry, Jesus demonstrated His authority over sin, death, and all aspects of creation. He performed miracles, taught with authority, and ultimately sacrificed Himself on the cross to reconcile humanity with God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Son of Man is also portrayed as the Lord of the Sabbath. Jesus challenged the religious leaders' legalistic understanding of the Sabbath by emphasizing its true purpose: to bring rest and restoration to people's lives. He revealed that He is the ultimate source of rest and salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding Jesus as the Son of Man is crucial for our faith. It reminds us that Jesus willingly humbled Himself to identify with us in every way. He experienced the limitations and challenges of being human while remaining fully God. This truth gives us assurance that we have a Savior who understands our struggles and empathizes with our weaknesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recognizing Jesus as the Son of Man also highlights His authority and power. As the one who will execute judgment, He calls us to surrender our lives to Him and follow His teachings. Knowing that Jesus will establish an everlasting kingdom encourages us to live with a sense of hope and anticipation for His return.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does understanding Jesus as both fully human and fully God impact your relationship with Him?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In what ways can you identify with the struggles and limitations that Jesus experienced as the Son of Man?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reflect on the humility of Jesus in becoming the Son of Man. How can you emulate His humility in your own life?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, Jesus being referred to as the Son of Man emphasizes His humanity and His supreme example of what God intended mankind to be. Despite being fully God, Jesus willingly took on human flesh to identify with us and save us. Recognizing Jesus as the Son of Man reminds us of His authority, power, and His future role as the ruler of an everlasting kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Jesus Christ/The Nature of Jesus/Humanity"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>'Revealing the Divine Humanity of Jesus: A Christian Exploration'</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/humanity-of-jesus/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-06-15T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-06-15T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-06-15:/humanity-of-jesus/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;The Humanity of Jesus&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The humanity of Jesus is a vital aspect of His identity, alongside His deity. Although it can be challenging for our finite minds to comprehend, the Bible affirms that Jesus was fully God and fully human. It is crucial to reject false views that either deny His divinity or His humanity, as both are biblical truths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Jesus as a Human Being&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus was born as a human being to fulfill God's plan of redemption. &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Galatians/4/Galatians-4-4.html"&gt;Galatians 4:4&lt;/a&gt;–5 explains that God sent His Son, born of a woman and under the law, to redeem those under the law. By being born as a human, Jesus could fulfill the requirements of the law on behalf of humanity. Only a perfect human, without sin, could perfectly keep and fulfill the law. Through His sacrificial death on the cross, Jesus exchanged our sin for His perfect righteousness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Necessity of Jesus' Humanity&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several reasons why Jesus had to be fully human. Firstly, God established the shedding of blood as necessary for the forgiveness of sins (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Leviticus/17/Leviticus-17-11.html"&gt;Leviticus 17:11&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/9/Hebrews-9-22.html"&gt;Hebrews 9:22&lt;/a&gt;). While animal sacrifices foreshadowed the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus, they were insufficient to permanently remove sin. Jesus, as the perfect Lamb of God, sacrificed His own human life and shed His blood to cover the sins of all who believe in Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/R9qoqQ75ifs" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, Jesus' humanity enabled Him to be tempted just like we are. &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/4/Hebrews-4-15.html"&gt;Hebrews 4:15&lt;/a&gt; asserts that Jesus was tempted in every way as we are, yet He was without sin. By experiencing human trials and temptations firsthand, Jesus can sympathize with our weaknesses and understand our struggles. This truth gives us confidence that He is a compassionate and understanding high priest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Significance of Jesus' Incarnation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Declaring that Jesus has come in the flesh is an essential mark of being led by the Spirit of God (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-John/4/1-John-4-2.html"&gt;1 John 4:2&lt;/a&gt;–3). The Antichrist and those who follow him will deny this truth. Jesus indeed came in the flesh, sinlessly experiencing our human frailties. His human blood was shed for our sins, and He was fully God and fully Man. These biblical truths cannot be denied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the humanity of Jesus is crucial for several reasons. Firstly, it reveals the depth of God's love and His desire to identify with humanity. Jesus willingly took on human form to redeem us and restore our relationship with God. Secondly, Jesus' humanity enables Him to empathize with us and intercede on our behalf as a compassionate high priest. Knowing that Jesus has experienced the same trials and temptations as us gives us comfort and assurance in our faith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The humanity of Jesus challenges us to reflect on the significance of His incarnation. It compels us to consider the immense sacrifice He made by becoming one of us, enduring suffering, and ultimately laying down His life for our salvation. Moreover, it reminds us that Jesus understands our struggles intimately and invites us to approach Him boldly in times of need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, the humanity of Jesus is a fundamental aspect of His identity. He was born as a human being while remaining fully divine. His humanity allowed Him to fulfill the requirements of the law and serve as the perfect sacrifice for our sins. By experiencing human trials and temptations, Jesus can sympathize with our weaknesses and intercede on our behalf. Recognizing the humanity of Jesus deepens our understanding of God's love and encourages us to approach Him confidently in our times of need.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Jesus Christ/The Nature of Jesus/Humanity"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>'Unveiling the Deity of Christ: The Ultimate Truth for Christian Believers'</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/deity-of-christ/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-06-06T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-06-06T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-06-06:/deity-of-christ/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Deity of Christ&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout the Bible, there is clear evidence that Jesus is not just a human being, but also the divine Son of God. This belief in the deity of Christ is central to Christian theology. Let's explore several key points that support this understanding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1. Jesus' Claims and …&lt;/h3&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Deity of Christ&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout the Bible, there is clear evidence that Jesus is not just a human being, but also the divine Son of God. This belief in the deity of Christ is central to Christian theology. Let's explore several key points that support this understanding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1. Jesus' Claims and Disciples' Acknowledgment&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus made explicit claims about Himself that point to His divine nature. For example, He claimed to have the authority to forgive sins, which is a power reserved for God alone. His disciples also recognized Jesus' deity and referred to Him as Lord and God. Thomas famously exclaimed, "My Lord and my God!" This acknowledgment by His followers demonstrates their belief in Jesus' divine nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/strong&gt;: Understanding the deity of Christ is crucial because it establishes Jesus' authority to forgive sins and judge both the living and the dead. It also affirms that Jesus is worthy of worship and obedience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It&lt;/strong&gt;: If Jesus is not divine, then His claims to forgive sins and judge the world would be false. How does recognizing Jesus as divine impact your understanding of His significance in your life?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2. Unique Titles Given to Jesus&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the New Testament, Jesus is given titles that are uniquely attributed to YHWH (the formal name of God) in the Old Testament. For example, Jesus is referred to as the Redeemer, a title previously used only for God. He is also called Immanuel, meaning "God with us." Additionally, Scriptures from the Old Testament that speak of YHWH are applied to Jesus in the New Testament. These titles and attributions further affirm Jesus' divinity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/strong&gt;: By bestowing upon Jesus these unique titles, the Bible emphasizes His identity as God incarnate. This highlights His role as our Redeemer and reinforces the truth that God Himself came to dwell among us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It&lt;/strong&gt;: How does recognizing Jesus as Immanuel, God with us, impact your understanding of His presence in your life? How does it shape your relationship with Him?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;3. Actions and Attributes of Deity&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus performed actions that only God can do. He raised the dead, forgave sins, and even created and sustains the universe. These deeds demonstrate His divine power and authority. Moreover, Jesus possesses attributes that are exclusive to deity, such as eternality, omnipresence, omniscience, and omnipotence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/strong&gt;: Recognizing Jesus' divine actions and attributes helps us understand that He is not merely a human prophet or a great teacher. Instead, He is God in the flesh, capable of accomplishing what only God can do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It&lt;/strong&gt;: How does understanding Jesus' divine attributes impact your trust in His ability to help you and guide your life?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;4. Miracles as Evidence of Deity&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7tE9avLdDKw" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus performed numerous miracles as evidence of His claim to be God. These miracles include turning water into wine, walking on water, multiplying food, healing the sick, raising the dead, and ultimately His own resurrection. The resurrection, in particular, sets Jesus apart from other religious figures because it has substantial historical evidence supporting it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/strong&gt;: The miracles Jesus performed provide tangible proof of His divinity. They demonstrate that He has power over nature, sickness, and even death itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It&lt;/strong&gt;: How does the reality of Jesus' miracles impact your faith in Him? How does it give you confidence in His ability to work miracles in your own life?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;5. Historical Facts and Resurrection&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several historical facts surrounding Jesus that even non-Christian scholars acknowledge. These facts include Jesus' crucifixion, burial, empty tomb, disciples' belief in seeing the risen Jesus, transformation of the disciples from doubters to bold believers, and the growth of the early Church. These facts, along with the resurrection itself, provide compelling evidence for Jesus' deity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/strong&gt;: The historical facts surrounding Jesus' life and resurrection establish the foundation of the Christian faith. They demonstrate that Jesus is not just a religious figure but the Son of God who conquered death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It&lt;/strong&gt;: How does the historical evidence for Jesus' resurrection impact your confidence in the truth of Christianity? How does it shape your understanding of Jesus' deity?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;6. The Witness of the Disciples&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The disciples' willingness to die for their faith is significant evidence of Jesus' deity. People do not willingly face persecution and death for something they know to be false. The disciples' transformation from fearful and doubtful to courageous and unwavering believers can only be explained by the reality of Jesus' resurrection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/strong&gt;: The disciples' testimony serves as a powerful witness to the truth of Jesus' divinity. Their unwavering commitment to their faith, even in the face of persecution and death, underscores the profound impact Jesus had on their lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It&lt;/strong&gt;: How does the disciples' steadfastness in the face of persecution inspire you in your own faith? How does it challenge you to live boldly for Christ?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;7. The Significance of Jesus' Deity&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recognizing Jesus as divine has profound implications for our faith. It means that He is not just a moral teacher or a religious figure but God Himself. Embracing His deity allows us to experience His forgiveness, guidance, and transformative power in our lives. Furthermore, it calls us to worship and follow Him wholeheartedly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/strong&gt;: Understanding Jesus' deity enables us to fully embrace Him as our Savior and Lord. It deepens our relationship with Him and empowers us to live according to His teachings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It&lt;/strong&gt;: How does recognizing Jesus as divine impact your relationship with Him? How does it shape your worship and obedience?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, the Bible presents compelling evidence for the deity of Christ. Jesus' own claims, the acknowledgment of His disciples, unique titles given to Him, His divine actions and attributes, miracles, historical facts surrounding His life and resurrection, and the witness of the disciples all point to His divine nature. Recognizing Jesus as God incarnate is foundational to the Christian faith. It affirms His authority, power, and ability to save us. May we embrace this truth and wholeheartedly follow Him in every aspect of our lives.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Jesus Christ/The Nature of Jesus/The Deity of Christ"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>"Unveiling Jesus' Sinful Flesh Likeness: A Profound Christian Revelation"</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/jesus-likeness-sinful-flesh/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-06-06T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-06-06T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-06-06:/jesus-likeness-sinful-flesh/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Jesus in the Likeness of Sinful Flesh&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept of Jesus coming in the likeness of sinful flesh is found in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/8/Romans-8-3.html"&gt;Romans 8:3&lt;/a&gt;–4. This passage states that God sent His own Son, Jesus, in the likeness of sinful flesh to be a sin offering. By doing this, God …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Jesus in the Likeness of Sinful Flesh&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept of Jesus coming in the likeness of sinful flesh is found in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/8/Romans-8-3.html"&gt;Romans 8:3&lt;/a&gt;–4. This passage states that God sent His own Son, Jesus, in the likeness of sinful flesh to be a sin offering. By doing this, God condemned sin in the flesh and fulfilled the righteous requirement of the law. To fully understand what it means for Jesus to come in the likeness of sinful flesh, we need to define a few terms and explore their significance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Meaning of "The Flesh"&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the Bible refers to "the flesh," it generally refers to the human tendency to sin that we all inherited from Adam. In other words, it represents our fallen nature. When Adam and Eve rebelled against God's commandment in the Garden of Eden, sin entered the world, corrupting everything. As descendants of Adam, we have all inherited this fallen nature, and therefore, we are all born as sinners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Likeness of Sinful Flesh&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word "likeness" means resemblance or similarity. It signifies that something is not identical in substance or nature but shares a resemblance or appearance with something else. In the case of Jesus, He took on the likeness of humanity by becoming fully human while retaining His divinity. He entered into our human experience, living the life we live, suffering as we suffer, and growing as we grow. However, unlike every other human being, Jesus did not inherit a sin nature because He did not have an earthly father. His conception was miraculous, with Mary being overshadowed by the Holy Spirit (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/1/Luke-1-35.html"&gt;Luke 1:35&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Jesus as Our Substitute&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus came in the likeness of sinful flesh to be our substitute. He willingly took on physical pain, emotional rejection, and spiritual separation from God. He lived a perfect life without sinning and maintained perfect fellowship with God. By doing so, He presented Himself as the final sacrifice sufficient to pay for the sins of all humanity. Jesus' sacrifice on the cross and His resurrection provide the means for us to receive forgiveness and reconciliation with God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wOkB6cxVXTc" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Receiving the Gift of Salvation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To receive the gift of salvation, we must acknowledge Jesus as our personal substitute. We come to Him in faith, recognizing that His sacrifice paid for our sins in full. Through faith in Jesus, our sinful flesh is crucified with Him, and we are set free to follow the guidance of the Holy Spirit and live in obedience to God. As Christians, we have Christ's death and resurrection credited to our account, wiping out the debt we owe to God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding that Jesus came in the likeness of sinful flesh is crucial because it reveals God's plan for our redemption. Jesus' sinless life and sacrificial death provide the way for us to be reconciled with God and experience eternal life. It underscores the seriousness of sin and highlights the incredible love and mercy of God in providing a substitute for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reflecting on Jesus coming in the likeness of sinful flesh should lead us to ask ourselves some important questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does knowing that Jesus came in the likeness of sinful flesh impact your understanding of His sacrifice?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What does it mean for you personally that Jesus became your substitute?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does this truth inspire you to live differently and follow Christ more closely?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we ponder these questions, let us remember the immense love and grace displayed through Jesus' willingness to take on human flesh, suffer, and die for our sins. May it deepen our gratitude and compel us to live lives that honor Him.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Jesus Christ/The Nature of Jesus/Humanity"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>'Understanding Jesus: The Divine Man Revealed'</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/jesus-god-man/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-06-02T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-06-02T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-06-02:/jesus-god-man/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Jesus: Fully God and Fully Man&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Bible teaches that Jesus Christ is both fully God and fully man. This concept may seem confusing, but the Council of Chalcedon in AD 451 affirmed the truth that Jesus is "the same perfect in divinity and perfect in humanity, the same truly God and truly man." This declaration aligns with what the Bible teaches on the subject. Scriptures clearly state that Jesus is God (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/20/John-20-28.html"&gt;John 20:28&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Titus/2/Titus-2-13.html"&gt;Titus 2:13&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/1/Hebrews-1-8.html"&gt;Hebrews 1:8&lt;/a&gt;) and also emphasize His true humanity (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/1/Romans-1-2.html"&gt;Romans 1:2&lt;/a&gt;–4; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-John/4/1-John-4-2.html"&gt;1 John 4:2&lt;/a&gt;–3).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to understand the significance of Jesus being both God and man. The apostle Paul wrote that affirming the divinity of Jesus is necessary for salvation (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/10/Romans-10-9.html"&gt;Romans 10:9&lt;/a&gt;). Additionally, the apostle John warned that denying Christ's true humanity promotes the doctrine of antichrist (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/2-John/1/2-John-1-7.html"&gt;2 John 1:7&lt;/a&gt;). Therefore, recognizing Jesus as both fully God and fully man is crucial to our Christian faith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Incarnation: God Becomes Man&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The triune God, consisting of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, has existed from all eternity. At a specific point in time, God the Son took on human flesh (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/1/Luke-1-35.html"&gt;Luke 1:35&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/1/Hebrews-1-5.html"&gt;Hebrews 1:5&lt;/a&gt;). This act is known as the Incarnation. In this miraculous event, God the Son added a sinless human nature to His eternally existent divine nature. The result was Jesus Christ—the Word made flesh (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/1/John-1-1.html"&gt;John 1:1&lt;/a&gt;, 14).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FoDqAdfU2As" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus' purpose in becoming fully human was twofold. First, He came to be a merciful and faithful high priest in service to God (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/2/Hebrews-2-17.html"&gt;Hebrews 2:17&lt;/a&gt;). By being fully human, Jesus could sympathize with our weaknesses and represent us before God. Second, Jesus came to make atonement for the sins of the people (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/2/Hebrews-2-17.html"&gt;Hebrews 2:17&lt;/a&gt;). As a sinless human, He became the perfect sacrifice to provide redemption to all who believe (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Galatians/4/Galatians-4-4.html"&gt;Galatians 4:4&lt;/a&gt;–5).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Dual Nature of Jesus&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout His earthly life, Jesus never ceased to be God. Even though He became fully human, His divine nature remained intact (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/6/Luke-6-5.html"&gt;Luke 6:5&lt;/a&gt;, 8). On the other hand, after the Incarnation, Jesus has never ceased to be human. The apostle Paul states that Jesus is the one mediator between God and humanity (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-Timothy/2/1-Timothy-2-5.html"&gt;1 Timothy 2:5&lt;/a&gt;). He is not half-human and half-divine but rather the God-man—fully God and fully man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dual nature of Jesus is a profound mystery. It means that while Jesus had all the attributes of deity, such as being all-knowing, all-powerful, and eternal, He also experienced humanity's limitations and emotions. Jesus displayed weaknesses and vulnerabilities common to humanity, such as hunger, thirst, and sadness (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/19/Luke-19-41.html"&gt;Luke 19:41&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/19/John-19-28.html"&gt;John 19:28&lt;/a&gt;). This unique combination of divinity and humanity allows Jesus to perfectly fulfill His role as our Savior and High Priest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the dual nature of Jesus has significant implications for our faith. It assures us that Jesus is uniquely qualified to represent us before God because He knows firsthand what it means to be human. We can approach Him with confidence, knowing that He sympathizes with our weaknesses (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/4/Hebrews-4-15.html"&gt;Hebrews 4:15&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, recognizing Jesus as both fully God and fully man affirms His ability to provide salvation for humanity. As a sinless human, He could offer Himself as the perfect sacrifice for our sins. Through faith in Him, we can receive forgiveness and eternal life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contemplating the dual nature of Jesus can lead us to a deeper appreciation of His love and sacrifice. As we reflect on His divinity, we are reminded of the magnitude of His power and authority. At the same time, pondering His humanity helps us grasp the depth of His love and compassion for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider the incredible humility it took for God to become a human being. Jesus willingly set aside the privileges and glory of His divine nature to identify with us in our brokenness. This demonstrates His immense love for us and serves as an example for how we should love and serve others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, Jesus Christ is both fully God and fully man. The Council of Chalcedon's declaration based on biblical teachings affirms this truth. The Incarnation—the act of God becoming man—allows Jesus to be our merciful High Priest and provide atonement for our sins. Recognizing the dual nature of Jesus is central to our faith and allows us to approach Him with confidence and receive salvation through Him. Let us marvel at the mystery of the God-man and strive to follow His example of love and humility.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Jesus Christ/The Nature of Jesus/God and Man"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>"Unleashing the Power of Jesus' Name: A Christian"'s Guide to Supernatural Authority'</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/power-in-the-name-of-jesus/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-05-24T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-05-24T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-05-24:/power-in-the-name-of-jesus/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Power in the Name of Jesus&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The power attributed to the name of Jesus originates from the person of Jesus. When we believe in Jesus' name, we are putting our trust in the finished work of the risen Christ on the cross (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-John/5/1-John-5-13.html"&gt;1 John 5:13&lt;/a&gt;). It is important to …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Power in the Name of Jesus&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The power attributed to the name of Jesus originates from the person of Jesus. When we believe in Jesus' name, we are putting our trust in the finished work of the risen Christ on the cross (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-John/5/1-John-5-13.html"&gt;1 John 5:13&lt;/a&gt;). It is important to understand that there is nothing inherently magical about the arrangement of letters in His name. The power that Christians access in Jesus' name comes from genuine faith in who Jesus is and what He has done for sinners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Power in Jesus Himself&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is crucial to recognize that any power associated with the name of Jesus is found in Jesus Christ Himself. Calling out the name of "Jesus" alone does not give us special power or a better standing with God. However, the name of Jesus holds great significance and meaning. Jesus is not just a great teacher, an enlightened man, or a worker of miracles. He is the Savior of sinners (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/1/Matthew-1-21.html"&gt;Matthew 1:21&lt;/a&gt;). The power of God, which saves, heals, protects, justifies, and redeems resides in the person of Christ, and Jesus is His name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus laid down His life to save sinners and exercised His authority to rise again (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/10/John-10-18.html"&gt;John 10:18&lt;/a&gt;). Those who call on His name in faith can receive forgiveness of sins and eternal salvation (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/10/Romans-10-13.html"&gt;Romans 10:13&lt;/a&gt;). This resurrection power is unique to Jesus alone. He is the force behind His name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Praying in Jesus' Name&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God instructs us to pray in Jesus' name (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/16/John-16-23.html"&gt;John 16:23-24&lt;/a&gt;). Praying in Jesus' name means praying with His authority and asking God the Father to act upon our prayers because we come by faith in the name of His Son, Jesus. It involves praying in line with Jesus' character and will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Praying in Jesus' name demonstrates our faith in God's power to act when we believe that Jesus' name represents who He truly is. It is not merely a grouping of letters but a representation of the person of Jesus Himself. We are invited to pray in Jesus' name with the expectation that God will answer our prayers (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/14/John-14-13.html"&gt;John 14:13-14&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Misusing the Name of Jesus&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We should be cautious not to misuse or manipulate the name of Jesus. In the Bible, there is an intriguing story about seven Jews in Ephesus who attempted to cast out demons using the name of Jesus. However, these men did not truly know Jesus or have a genuine relationship with Him. Their intentions were self-centered, seeking admiration and personal gain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The evil spirits recognized their lack of authority and mocked them by saying, "Jesus I know, and Paul I know about, but who are you?" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Acts/19/Acts-19-15.html"&gt;Acts 19:15&lt;/a&gt;). The evil spirit even empowered the possessed man to attack and overpower them. This story serves as a reminder that we cannot use the name of Jesus for our own selfish purposes. We must approach His name with reverence and respect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Name of Jesus Holds Saving Power&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The name of Jesus holds all the power of the mighty Creator Himself. Through faith in the person of Jesus, believers experience God's saving grace. The name of Jesus is the only name by which we can be saved (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Acts/4/Acts-4-12.html"&gt;Acts 4:12&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HwEXH-jIsgA" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As adopted sons and daughters into God's family, Christians participate in His power when they call on Him. The name of the Lord is like a fortified tower where the righteous can find safety (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Proverbs/18/Proverbs-18-10.html"&gt;Proverbs 18:10&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the power in the name of Jesus is crucial for every believer. It reminds us that our faith should not be placed in rituals or incantations but in a personal relationship with Jesus Christ Himself. It also emphasizes the importance of praying in alignment with His character and will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recognizing the true power behind His name helps us avoid misusing or trivializing it. Instead, we should approach the name of Jesus with reverence, respecting its significance and the authority it carries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Think About It&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you ever treated the name of Jesus as a magic word or incantation? How can you deepen your understanding of the power in His name?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In what ways can you align your prayers with the character and will of Jesus? How can you grow in faith when praying in His name?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reflect on the story of the seven sons of Sceva in Acts 19. How does this cautionary tale remind you of the importance of approaching the name of Jesus with respect and sincerity?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember, the power attributed to the name of Jesus is not in the word itself but in the person it represents. When we trust in Jesus' finished work on the cross and believe in who He is, we can access the saving power, grace, and authority that His name carries.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Jesus Christ/The Nature of Jesus/The Deity of Christ"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>'Unlocking the Divine Mystery: Understanding the Deity of Christ'</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/divinity-of-christ/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-05-18T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-05-18T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-05-18:/divinity-of-christ/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;The Divinity of Christ&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The divinity of Jesus Christ is a central belief within Christianity. Throughout the New Testament, Jesus is not only presented as the Messiah but also equated with God Himself. The apostle Paul, in his letters, refers to Jesus as our "great God and Savior" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Titus/2/Titus-2-13.html"&gt;Titus 2 …&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;The Divinity of Christ&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The divinity of Jesus Christ is a central belief within Christianity. Throughout the New Testament, Jesus is not only presented as the Messiah but also equated with God Himself. The apostle Paul, in his letters, refers to Jesus as our "great God and Savior" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Titus/2/Titus-2-13.html"&gt;Titus 2:13&lt;/a&gt;) and asserts that Jesus existed in the "form of God" before His incarnation (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Philippians/2/Philippians-2-5.html"&gt;Philippians 2:5-8&lt;/a&gt;). The book of Hebrews declares, "Your throne, O God, will last forever and ever" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/1/Hebrews-1-8.html"&gt;Hebrews 1:8&lt;/a&gt;), attributing divine authority to Jesus. Additionally, Jesus is directly identified as the Creator (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/1/John-1-3.html"&gt;John 1:3&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Colossians/1/Colossians-1-16.html"&gt;Colossians 1:16-17&lt;/a&gt;) and other passages in the Bible affirm His deity (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Revelation/1/Revelation-1-7.html"&gt;Revelation 1:7&lt;/a&gt;; 2:8; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-Corinthians/10/1-Corinthians-10-4.html"&gt;1 Corinthians 10:4&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-Peter/5/1-Peter-5-4.html"&gt;1 Peter 5:4&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Jesus as the Son of Man&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One particular self-designation of Jesus that provides evidence for His divinity is "Son of Man." This title appears multiple times in all four Gospels, indicating that it was used by Jesus Himself. In Mark 14, during His trial before the High Priest, Jesus claims to be the Son of Man from Daniel's vision. In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Daniel/7/Daniel-7-13.html"&gt;Daniel 7:13-14&lt;/a&gt;, it is stated that this Son of Man would be given dominion, glory, and an everlasting kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By referring to Himself as the Son of Man, Jesus associates Himself with this figure who possesses everlasting power and a unique authority beyond that of a mere human being. The use of this title by Jesus is significant because it is unlikely that it would have been attributed to Him if He had not used it himself. Thus, the self-designation "Son of Man" provides compelling evidence for Jesus' divine self-understanding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Actions and Worship&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus' actions and the worship He receives also point to His divinity. In Mark 2, Jesus heals a paralytic man not only to demonstrate His authority but also to show that He has the power to forgive sins. By forgiving sins, Jesus is assuming a divine prerogative that was traditionally reserved for God alone. This act challenges the Jewish audience's understanding of who Jesus is and indicates His divine nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, Jesus receives worship from various individuals and groups throughout the Gospels. He does not reject their worship but rather accepts it as appropriate. This acceptance of worship implies that Jesus understood Himself to be worthy of worship, which aligns with divine status. Jesus' teachings also emphasize His role as the judge of humanity and the importance of one's response to Him for their eternal destiny. These teachings further support Jesus' divine self-understanding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Resurrection&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The resurrection of Jesus serves as a powerful confirmation of His claims to divinity. After being crucified and buried, Jesus rose from the dead, establishing His authority and validating His teachings. Numerous contemporary sources report Jesus' post-resurrection appearances to individuals and groups under various circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact that many witnesses were willing to die for their belief in Jesus' resurrection adds credibility to this event. The theories proposed to explain away the resurrection, such as the Hallucination Theory, have failed to account for all the known data. The resurrection of Jesus is an established historical fact and serves as the strongest evidence for His divinity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MYQz-8flxsQ" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Understanding the divinity of Christ is essential for Christians as it forms the foundation of their faith. Believing in Jesus as fully divine affirms His role as Savior and Lord. It demonstrates that salvation comes through faith in Him alone and acknowledges Him as the ultimate authority in our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recognizing Jesus' divinity also provides assurance of His power and ability to forgive sins. It assures believers that Jesus is not merely a moral teacher or a good example but a divine being who has the authority to offer forgiveness and grant eternal life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contemplating the divinity of Christ challenges us to consider the implications of who Jesus claimed to be. If Jesus truly is divine, then our response to Him is of utmost importance. It calls us to examine our beliefs, attitudes, and actions in light of His teachings and to surrender our lives to Him as our Lord and Savior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The divinity of Christ also invites us to reflect on the significance of His resurrection. If Jesus conquered death and rose from the dead, it validates His claims and offers hope for eternal life. It prompts us to consider the reality of life beyond this world and the importance of our relationship with Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the divinity of Christ is a foundational belief that shapes the Christian faith. It is through understanding and embracing this truth that we can experience the fullness of salvation, forgiveness, and eternal life in Him.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Jesus Christ/The Nature of Jesus/The Deity of Christ"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>'Unveiling the Holiness of Christ: A Divine Encounter'</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/holiness-of-christ/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-05-12T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-05-12T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-05-12:/holiness-of-christ/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Holiness of Christ&lt;/h2&gt;

Understanding the holiness of Christ requires a proper understanding of His deity and His role as the Savior …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Holiness of Christ&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The holiness of Christ is a fundamental aspect of His nature and character. It encompasses both His absolute moral purity and His divine status as the Son of God. Understanding the holiness of Christ requires a proper understanding of His deity and His role as the Savior of humanity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1. Definition of Holiness&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Holiness can be defined in two primary ways. First, it refers to absolute moral purity and righteousness, untainted by sin or error. God, who is holy, exemplifies this standard of perfection. Second, holiness also refers to being set apart for God's purpose. This can be seen in the example of the temple in Jerusalem, which was considered "holy" because it was dedicated to God's worship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2. The Holiness of Christ and His Deity&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The holiness of Christ is closely tied to His deity. Jesus claimed to be God, accepted worship, and declared His unity with the Father. The apostle John testified to Jesus' divinity in his gospel account, stating that Jesus is the Word who was with God and was God. Christ's holiness is an inherent part of His divine nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;3. Misunderstandings about the Holiness of Christ&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Various misunderstandings exist regarding the person and nature of Christ Jesus. Some view Him merely as a historic figure, a prophet, or a moral teacher. Others believe He is an angel or a spiritual brother of Lucifer. However, these perspectives fail to acknowledge His true identity as both fully God and fully man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;4. Awe and Respect for the Holy One&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/P9RXKQQoJlQ" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The holiness of Christ demands awe and respect from humanity. While Jesus draws us to Himself with love and compassion, we must never treat Him as an equal. His unparalleled goodness and radiant glory contrast sharply with our fallen state. Approaching Him in a flippant or careless manner is dishonorable. Instead, we should approach Him with reverence and adoration, recognizing His authority and majesty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;5. Fear and Awe in the Presence of Christ&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The encounter between Jesus and Simon Peter on the Lake of Galilee illustrates the mixture of attraction and fear that arises from the holiness of Christ. When Jesus performed a miraculous catch of fish, Peter fell at His feet in fear, recognizing his own sinfulness in contrast to Christ's holiness. This experience reveals the natural response of sinful humanity when faced with the presence of the Holy One.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;6. The Invitation of Christ&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite our sinfulness, Christ invites us to come to Him for rest and salvation. He does not recoil from our wickedness but extends His love and grace to us. Through faith in Him as our Savior, we are transformed from children of wrath into beloved sons and daughters of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the holiness of Christ is crucial because it shapes our perception of who He is and how we relate to Him. Recognizing His holiness helps us approach Him with awe, reverence, and respect. It also emphasizes the need for salvation through faith in Him as the only One capable of forgiving our sins and reconciling us to God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider your own understanding of the holiness of Christ. How does this understanding impact your relationship with Him? In what ways can you cultivate a greater sense of reverence and awe for the Holy One? Reflect on the invitation Jesus extends to you to come to Him for rest and salvation.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Jesus Christ/The Nature of Jesus/The Deity of Christ"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>'Emmanuel: Understanding the Divine Concept of God Incarnate'</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/god-incarnate/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-05-07T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-05-07T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-05-07:/god-incarnate/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;God Incarnate&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept of God incarnate refers to the belief that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, took on a human form while still retaining His divine nature. This is a foundational doctrine of Christianity and is supported by biblical teachings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Jesus' Nature as Both Man and God&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;God Incarnate&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept of God incarnate refers to the belief that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, took on a human form while still retaining His divine nature. This is a foundational doctrine of Christianity and is supported by biblical teachings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Jesus' Nature as Both Man and God&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we say that Jesus is God incarnate, we mean that He took on a fleshly, bodily form while still being fully divine. In other words, Jesus became fully human but did not stop being deity. This is a mystery of Christianity and a test of orthodoxy. Jesus has two distinct natures, divine and human. The Bible clearly teaches the deity of Christ through various ways: the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies, His eternal existence, His miraculous virgin birth, His authority to forgive sins, His acceptance of worship, His ability to predict the future, and His resurrection from the dead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Incarnation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Incarnation refers to Jesus becoming fully human by taking on human flesh. He was conceived in the womb and born like any other human being. Jesus experienced normal aging, had physical needs and emotions, learned, died a physical death, and was resurrected with a physical body. However, unlike all other humans, Jesus lived a completely sinless life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Position Change&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Jesus took on human form, His nature did not change but His position did. In His original nature as God in spirit form, He humbled Himself by laying aside His glory and privileges. It is important to note that God cannot stop being God because He is immutable and infinite. If Jesus stopped being fully God for even a split second, all life would cease to exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ITEzXLcpKZs" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the concept of God incarnate is crucial for Christians because it speaks to the central message of the gospel. Jesus' incarnation allows Him to bridge the gap between humanity and divinity, making salvation possible. By becoming fully human, Jesus was able to live a sinless life and offer Himself as the perfect sacrifice for our sins. His death and resurrection provide the means for reconciliation with God and eternal life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Think About It&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea of God becoming a human being may seem difficult to comprehend. How can someone be both fully human and fully divine at the same time? It is important to remember that some aspects of our faith are beyond our full understanding. However, this does not mean that we cannot have confidence in the truth of God's Word. The mystery of the Incarnation invites us to reflect on the greatness of God and His love for us. It also reminds us that God is willing to meet us where we are, in our humanity, in order to redeem us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, the concept of God incarnate is a fundamental belief in Christianity. Jesus Christ, while remaining fully God, took on human form to save humanity from sin and restore our relationship with God. This doctrine is supported by biblical teachings and is central to the message of the gospel. While it may be challenging to fully comprehend, we can trust in the truth of God's Word and embrace the mystery of the Incarnation as a demonstration of God's love and grace towards us.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Jesus Christ/The Nature of Jesus/The Deity of Christ"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Unveiling the Divine Mystery of Hypostatic Union in Christian Faith</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/hypostatic-union/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-05-02T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-05-02T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-05-02:/hypostatic-union/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;The Hypostatic Union: Jesus, Fully God and Fully Man&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hypostatic union refers to the concept of how Jesus Christ, the Son of God, took on a human nature while remaining fully divine. Prior to His incarnation, Jesus had always been God (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/8/John-8-58.html"&gt;John 8:58&lt;/a&gt;, 10:30). However, at the …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;The Hypostatic Union: Jesus, Fully God and Fully Man&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hypostatic union refers to the concept of how Jesus Christ, the Son of God, took on a human nature while remaining fully divine. Prior to His incarnation, Jesus had always been God (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/8/John-8-58.html"&gt;John 8:58&lt;/a&gt;, 10:30). However, at the moment of His birth, Jesus became a human being (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/1/John-1-14.html"&gt;John 1:14&lt;/a&gt;). This union of the human and divine natures in Jesus is what we refer to as the hypostatic union. In this state, Jesus is both fully God and fully man in one Person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Two Natures, One Person&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus' two natures, human and divine, are inseparable. He will forever be the God-man, with both natures intact. These two natures exist together in perfect unity without any loss of their separate identities. While Jesus sometimes operated within the limitations of His humanity (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/4/John-4-6.html"&gt;John 4:6&lt;/a&gt;, 19:28), He also demonstrated the power of His deity (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/11/John-11-43.html"&gt;John 11:43&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/14/Matthew-14-18.html"&gt;Matthew 14:18-21&lt;/a&gt;). In both cases, His actions originated from His one Person. Although Jesus possesses two natures, He has only one personality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Understanding the Hypostatic Union&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TMIabK3Op1w" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The doctrine of the hypostatic union seeks to explain how Jesus can be both fully God and fully man simultaneously. However, it is important to recognize that this is a concept beyond complete human comprehension. As finite beings, we cannot fully understand the ways of an infinite God. Our attempts to understand the hypostatic union should be rooted in humility and an acknowledgment of our limitations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Eternal Existence of Jesus&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus is referred to as God's Son because He was conceived by the Holy Spirit (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/1/Luke-1-35.html"&gt;Luke 1:35&lt;/a&gt;). However, this does not imply that Jesus did not exist before His conception. Jesus has always existed (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/8/John-8-58.html"&gt;John 8:58&lt;/a&gt;, 10:30). His incarnation involved taking on human form in addition to His eternal divine nature (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/1/John-1-1.html"&gt;John 1:1&lt;/a&gt;, 14). By becoming a human being, Jesus could identify with our struggles (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/2/Hebrews-2-17.html"&gt;Hebrews 2:17&lt;/a&gt;) and ultimately provide salvation by dying on the cross for our sins (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Philippians/2/Philippians-2-5.html"&gt;Philippians 2:5-11&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the hypostatic union is vital for Christians because it affirms the divinity of Jesus while also emphasizing His humanity. Jesus' ability to fully relate to us as a human being allows Him to empathize with our struggles and challenges. Moreover, Jesus' sacrifice on the cross holds profound significance in our salvation. By uniting His divine nature with our human nature, Jesus provided the perfect atonement for our sins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hypostatic union invites us to contemplate the incredible mystery of how Jesus can be both fully God and fully man. It reminds us that God's ways are beyond our understanding and that we must approach Him with humility and reverence. Reflecting on the hypostatic union can deepen our appreciation for the love and sacrifice Jesus demonstrated by taking on human form to redeem us. It also serves as a reminder of the unique relationship we can have with Jesus, who fully understands our human experiences.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Jesus Christ/The Nature of Jesus/God and Man"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Is Jesus Truly God?

&lt;p&gt;Many people wonder whether Jesus is truly God. While the Bible does not include a direct statement from Jesus saying, "I am God," there are several passages that strongly indicate His divine nature. For example, in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/10/John-10-30.html"&gt;John 10:30&lt;/a&gt;, Jesus declares, "I and the Father are one …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Is Jesus God?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many people wonder whether Jesus is truly God. While the Bible does not include a direct statement from Jesus saying, "I am God," there are several passages that strongly indicate His divine nature. For example, in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/10/John-10-30.html"&gt;John 10:30&lt;/a&gt;, Jesus declares, "I and the Father are one." The Jews who heard this statement understood that He was claiming to be God, and they wanted to stone Him for blasphemy. Likewise, in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/8/John-8-58.html"&gt;John 8:58&lt;/a&gt;, Jesus says, "Before Abraham was born, I am!" This references &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Exodus/3/Exodus-3-14.html"&gt;Exodus 3:14&lt;/a&gt; when God revealed Himself as the "I AM." The Jews again sought to kill Jesus for blasphemy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept of Jesus' deity is reiterated throughout the New Testament. In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/1/John-1-1.html"&gt;John 1:1&lt;/a&gt; and 14, we read that "the Word [Jesus] was God" and "the Word became flesh," indicating that Jesus is God in human form. &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Acts/20/Acts-20-28.html"&gt;Acts 20:28&lt;/a&gt; tells us that the church was purchased with the blood of God, referring to Jesus. Furthermore, in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/1/Hebrews-1-8.html"&gt;Hebrews 1:8&lt;/a&gt;, the Father acknowledges Jesus as God when He says, "'Your throne, O God, will last forever and ever.'"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even Thomas the disciple recognized Jesus as God when he exclaimed, "My Lord and my God" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/20/John-20-28.html"&gt;John 20:28&lt;/a&gt;), and Jesus did not correct him. Additionally, &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Titus/2/Titus-2-13.html"&gt;Titus 2:13&lt;/a&gt; encourages believers to await the coming of "our God and Savior, Jesus Christ." In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Revelation/19/Revelation-19-10.html"&gt;Revelation 19:10&lt;/a&gt;, an angel instructs John to worship only God. However, throughout the Gospels and other New Testament books, we find instances where people worship Jesus without Him rebuking them. If Jesus were not God, He would have surely corrected them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0SOJEyzdg-M" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most crucial reasons why Jesus must be God is that His death would not have been sufficient to pay for the sins of the world if He were not God. Only God could pay an infinite penalty for sin against an infinite God. Jesus, being God incarnate, was able to take on the sins of the world, die, and be resurrected, triumphing over sin and death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding that Jesus is God is essential for our faith. If Jesus were merely a created being, He would not have been able to pay the price for our sins. As believers, we need assurance that our Savior is fully divine and capable of providing us with eternal salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider the implications of Jesus' claim to be God. How does this affect your understanding of His work on the cross and the significance of His resurrection?

&lt;p&gt;The Bible uses the term "word" in different ways, specifically in the New Testament. There are two Greek words translated as "word": rhema and logos. Rhema typically means "a spoken word," while logos has a broader, more philosophical meaning. In the context of John 1, where the …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Word Became Flesh&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bible uses the term "word" in different ways, specifically in the New Testament. There are two Greek words translated as "word": rhema and logos. Rhema typically means "a spoken word," while logos has a broader, more philosophical meaning. In the context of John 1, where the phrase "Word became flesh" is found, the word used is logos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Logos implies a total message and is often used to refer to God's message to mankind. For example, when Jesus taught the people, they were amazed not just by the specific words He chose but by His total message (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/4/Luke-4-32.html"&gt;Luke 4:32&lt;/a&gt;). In John 1, "The Word" refers to Jesus Christ, who is the embodiment of everything that God wants to communicate to humanity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first chapter of John provides insight into the relationship between the Father and Son before Jesus came to earth in human form. It reveals that Jesus preexisted with the Father, was involved in the creation of everything, and is the "light of all mankind" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/1/John-1-1.html"&gt;John 1:1-4&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God the Father is Spirit and invisible to the human eye. Throughout history, God had spoken messages of love and redemption through prophets, but these messages often went unheeded (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Ezekiel/22/Ezekiel-22-26.html"&gt;Ezekiel 22:26&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/23/Matthew-23-37.html"&gt;Matthew 23:37&lt;/a&gt;). People found it easy to disregard the message of an invisible God and continued to live in sin and rebellion. Therefore, God's message took on human form and became flesh in Jesus Christ (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/1/Matthew-1-23.html"&gt;Matthew 1:23&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/8/Romans-8-3.html"&gt;Romans 8:3&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Philippians/2/Philippians-2-5.html"&gt;Philippians 2:5&lt;/a&gt;–11).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dzwWz4uOwrM" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The Greek Concept of Logos&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Greeks used the term logos to refer to one's "mind," "reason," or "wisdom." John utilized this Greek concept to communicate that Jesus, as the Second Person of the Trinity, is the self-expression of God to the world. In the Old Testament, the word of God brought the universe into existence and saved those in need (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/33/Psalm-33-6.html"&gt;Psalm 33:6&lt;/a&gt;; 107:20). In his Gospel, John appeals to both Jews and Gentiles to receive the eternal Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Parable of the Vineyard&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To further explain why the Word had to become flesh, Jesus told a parable in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/20/Luke-20-9.html"&gt;Luke 20:9&lt;/a&gt;–16. The parable involves a man who planted a vineyard and rented it to some farmers. When it was time for harvest, he sent servants to collect some of the fruit, but they were beaten and sent away empty-handed. The man then decided to send his son, thinking that the tenants would respect him. However, when the tenants saw the son, they conspired to kill him, hoping to inherit the vineyard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through this parable, Jesus reminded the Jewish leaders that they had rejected the prophets and were now rejecting Him, the Son. As a result, the Word of God, Jesus Christ, would now be offered to everyone, not just the Jews (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/10/John-10-16.html"&gt;John 10:16&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Galatians/2/Galatians-2-28.html"&gt;Galatians 2:28&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Colossians/3/Colossians-3-11.html"&gt;Colossians 3:11&lt;/a&gt;). Because the Word became flesh, believers have a high priest in Jesus who can empathize with their weaknesses since He was tempted in every way yet remained sinless (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/4/Hebrews-4-15.html"&gt;Hebrews 4:15&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding that Jesus is the Word made flesh is crucial for Christians. It reveals that Jesus is not merely a great teacher or prophet but is God Himself incarnate. In Him, we see the fullness of God's message and love for humanity. Through His life, death, and resurrection, Jesus offers salvation and redemption to all who believe in Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recognizing Jesus as the Word made flesh also helps us grasp the significance of His teachings. His words carry authority because they are not just human words but the very words of God. By studying and understanding His message, we can align our lives with God's will and experience the transformative power of His Word.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider the impact of Jesus being the Word made flesh. How does this truth affect your understanding of who Jesus is and the authority of His teachings? How does it change your perspective on salvation and redemption? Take time to reflect on the profound implications of Jesus as the embodiment of God's message to humanity.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Jesus Christ/The Nature of Jesus/God and Man"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>'Divine Truth Revealed: God Is Not a Man'</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/god-is-not-a-man/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-04-09T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-04-09T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-04-09:/god-is-not-a-man/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;God is not a man&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The claim that Jesus cannot be God because the Old Testament states that "God is not a man" (Numbers 23:19a) has caused confusion and debate among some. However, when we carefully examine the biblical text, we find that Jesus himself claimed to be both the Son of God and the Son of Man. This unique claim, known as the hypostatic union, means that Jesus is fully God and fully human. While we may not fully understand this union, we can choose to believe in Jesus based on his own words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Old Testament's contrast between God and man&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the Old Testament declares that "God is not a man," it is emphasizing that God does not lie or change like human beings do. It is highlighting the difference between God's unchanging nature and the flaws and limitations of humanity. This contrast does not restrict God from becoming a man in a different way. In fact, God had planned for redemption through the incarnation of Jesus even before &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Numbers/23/Numbers-23-19.html"&gt;Numbers 23:19&lt;/a&gt; was written.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Progressive revelation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the Bible requires recognizing that God reveals His truth progressively over time. He has unfolded His purposes sequentially throughout history. For example, in the Garden of Eden, Adam and Eve did not need to know about redemption until after they sinned. Similarly, the full meaning of certain Old Testament prophecies only became clear with the coming of Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The New Testament reveals Jesus as both God and man&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New Testament provides further revelation about Jesus' identity as both God and man. While the Old Testament foreshadows this truth, it is in the New Testament that we see it fully revealed. John the Baptist's prophecies and the miracles performed by Jesus serve as signs to prove his divine nature. Those who respond in faith to these signs acknowledge Jesus as the Messiah, the Son of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FoDqAdfU2As" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding Jesus' identity is crucial to our faith as Christians. If we deny Jesus' divinity, we undermine the foundation of our belief in salvation through his sacrifice on the cross. Recognizing Jesus as fully God and fully human allows us to experience the depth of God's love and the power of his redemptive work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider the implications of Jesus being both God and man. How does this impact your understanding of God's character and his plan for redemption? Reflect on the significance of Jesus' miracles as signs of his divine nature. How does this strengthen your faith in him as the Messiah?&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Jesus Christ/The Nature of Jesus/God and Man"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>'Unlocking the Mystery of Kenosis: Revealing the Ultimate Act of Selflessness'</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/kenosis/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-04-06T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-04-06T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-04-06:/kenosis/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Kenosis: Christ's Self-Emptying in the Incarnation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept of kenosis refers to the doctrine of Christ's "self-emptying" during His incarnation. This term is derived from the Greek word kenosis, which is found in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Philippians/2/Philippians-2-7.html"&gt;Philippians 2:7&lt;/a&gt;. The verse states that Jesus "emptied himself, by taking the form of a servant …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Kenosis: Christ's Self-Emptying in the Incarnation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept of kenosis refers to the doctrine of Christ's "self-emptying" during His incarnation. This term is derived from the Greek word kenosis, which is found in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Philippians/2/Philippians-2-7.html"&gt;Philippians 2:7&lt;/a&gt;. The verse states that Jesus "emptied himself, by taking the form of a servant, being born in the likeness of men" (ESV). However, it is important to note that the verse does not explicitly mention what Jesus emptied Himself of. We must be cautious not to go beyond what Scripture reveals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contrary to some misconceptions, Jesus did not empty Himself of His divine attributes. The verse does not mention any specific attributes, and it is evident from the Gospels that Jesus possessed the power and wisdom of God. For instance, Jesus displayed His divine power by calming storms (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/4/Mark-4-39.html"&gt;Mark 4:39&lt;/a&gt;). Therefore, in His incarnation, Jesus did not cease to be God, nor did He become a "lesser god." Instead, we should understand His "emptying" as a laying aside of the privileges He had in heaven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than remaining on His heavenly throne, Jesus chose to "make himself nothing" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Philippians/2/Philippians-2-7.html"&gt;Philippians 2:7&lt;/a&gt;, NIV) and gave up His divine privileges (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Philippians/2/Philippians-2-7.html"&gt;Philippians 2:7&lt;/a&gt;, NLT). He veiled His glory and willingly took on the position of a servant. This self-renunciation was not an emptying of His deity or an exchange of deity for humanity. Throughout His earthly ministry, Jesus never ceased to be God. He set aside His heavenly glory and voluntarily refrained from using His divinity to ease His way. Instead, He fully submitted Himself to the will of the Father (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/5/John-5-19.html"&gt;John 5:19&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of kenosis, Jesus sometimes operated within the limitations of humanity. Although God does not experience fatigue or thirst, Jesus did (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/4/John-4-6.html"&gt;John 4:6&lt;/a&gt;; 19:28). While God is all-knowing, it seems that, at least once, Jesus voluntarily chose not to exercise His omniscience (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/24/Matthew-24-36.html"&gt;Matthew 24:36&lt;/a&gt;). However, there were also instances where Jesus displayed His omniscience (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/6/Luke-6-8.html"&gt;Luke 6:8&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/13/John-13-11.html"&gt;John 13:11&lt;/a&gt;; 18:4).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wgH5vOcd02g" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is important to note that there are false teachers who take the concept of kenosis too far. They claim that Jesus gave up all or some of His divine nature during His earthly life. This heretical view is sometimes referred to as the kenosis theory. However, it is crucial to distinguish this erroneous teaching, known as kenoticism or kenotic theology, from the biblical understanding of kenosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When considering the kenosis, we often focus on what Jesus gave up. However, it is equally important to consider what He took on. In His humility for our sake, Jesus added a human nature to His divine nature. He went from being the glorious ruler in heaven to becoming a human being who ultimately suffered death on the cross. &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Philippians/2/Philippians-2-7.html"&gt;Philippians 2:7-8&lt;/a&gt; declares that Jesus "took the very nature of a servant, being made in human likeness. And being found in appearance as a man, He humbled Himself and became obedient to death—even death on a cross!" This act of humility involved Christ taking on a human nature with all its limitations but without sin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the concept of kenosis helps us appreciate the depth of Christ's sacrifice and humility. It teaches us that Jesus willingly laid aside His heavenly privileges and took on the form of a servant for our salvation. Through the incarnation, Jesus identified with humanity and experienced our struggles firsthand. Recognizing this truth enables us to grasp the magnitude of God's love for us and motivates us to live in gratitude and obedience to Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does the concept of kenosis challenge your understanding of Christ's incarnation?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In what ways does the self-emptying of Christ inspire you to live a life of humility and servanthood?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reflect on the fact that Jesus willingly took on human limitations for our sake. How does this truth deepen your appreciation for His sacrifice?&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question of whether Jesus Christ has two natures or only one is not explicitly addressed in the Bible. However, understanding that Christ has two natures is the most biblically and theologically consistent position. The New Testament provides information that indicates Jesus is both fully God and fully man. While this may be difficult to understand and explain, it aligns with the teachings of the New Testament. Jesus is God who entered the human race as a man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Understanding Jesus' Nature&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/1/John-1-1.html"&gt;John 1:1&lt;/a&gt;, the Word is God. In verse 14, we see that the Word John speaks of is Jesus, who took on human flesh and "tabernacled" among us. Additionally, Matthew and Luke both record Jesus' birth from the Virgin Mary and provide His human lineage. From these passages, we can conclude that Jesus is both truly human, born into the human race, and fully God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Incorrect Explanations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FwZf6fp_uQw" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some early groups attempted to explain the nature of Christ by suggesting that the divine "Christ spirit" came upon the man Jesus. For example, certain Gnostic groups believed that the Christ spirit came upon Jesus at His baptism and left Him at the crucifixion. In this scenario, it may seem like Jesus had two natures, but upon closer examination, this is not the case. The man identified as Jesus would actually be two separate entities sharing a body, with each person having only one nature. He would be Jesus the human and Christ the divine. However, this explanation suggests that God only appears to enter the human race without actually doing so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another incorrect explanation suggests that Jesus Christ was only one person with one nature. However, this would mean that His nature would be a combination of divine and human elements. He would not be fully human because the divine nature has mixed with the human nature, making Him something more than human. Similarly, He would not be fully God because the human nature has mixed with the divine nature, making Him something less than divine. This idea parallels Greek and Roman mythology, where a god has a child with a human woman, resulting in an offspring that is more than human but less than a god.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Illustration of Christ's Nature&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An illustration may help in understanding this concept, although it should not be seen as a perfect analogy. Consider a king who wants to identify with the poorest in his country. One way he could achieve this is by disguising himself as a beggar and interacting with them. However, in this situation, he is only pretending to be a beggar since he can return to the comforts of the castle at night and retains all the resources of a king. On the other hand, the king could renounce his throne and give away everything, truly becoming a beggar. However, in doing so, he would cease to be a king. A third option is that the king could temporarily give up the use of his resources for a set period while knowing that he will ultimately resume his position as king. In this last scenario, he is both truly a beggar and truly a king. Jesus became man but remained God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Hypostatic Union&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only way to adequately explain the biblical data is to understand that Jesus is one person with two natures—a human nature and a divine nature. He is both God and Man. The New Testament affirms that Jesus Christ, who walked the earth, died on a cross, and rose again, was fully human with a functioning human nature (without sin). Simultaneously, Jesus was fully God. He willingly humbled Himself and gave up His glory and the independent use of His divine attributes while still remaining God. Jesus Christ is fully man and fully God—He possesses the nature of both. He is the Man who is also God, and He is God who became a Man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the two natures of Jesus is crucial for our faith and salvation. If Jesus were not fully God, His sacrifice on the cross would not have been sufficient to atone for our sins. Only a perfect, sinless sacrifice could pay the price for humanity's redemption. Additionally, if Jesus were not fully man, He would not have been able to represent humanity and serve as our High Priest, interceding on our behalf before God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contemplating the nature of Jesus can deepen our appreciation for His sacrifice and the magnitude of what He accomplished on our behalf. It reminds us that God loved us so much that He entered into human history as one of us to save us from our sins. The two natures of Christ also highlight the profound mystery of God's nature and His willingness to bridge the gap between divinity and humanity.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Jesus Christ/The Nature of Jesus/God and Man"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry></feed>

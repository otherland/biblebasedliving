&lt;p&gt;The concept of the Trinity can be challenging to understand, as it involves the nature of God as three distinct Persons in one.

&lt;p&gt;The concept of the Trinity can be challenging to understand, as it involves the nature of God as three distinct Persons in one. The Trinity consists of God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit. These three Persons are coequal and coeternal, meaning none is inferior or superior to the other. In this article, we will focus on God the Son.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Who is God the Son?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God the Son is the second Person of the Trinity. He is revealed to creation as the only and eternally begotten Son of God the Father. While He shares the same essence with God the Father and God the Holy Spirit, He is distinct from them in Personhood and function. God the Son has always existed as fully God (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/1/John-1-1.html"&gt;John 1:1&lt;/a&gt;–2), and He is one with God the Father. However, He submits Himself to the Father in function and work. His primary role is to fulfill the will of God the Father (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/6/John-6-38.html"&gt;John 6:38&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Incarnation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although God the Son is fully divine, He became fully human through an event known as the incarnation. In this act, He took on flesh and experienced humanity in all its aspects, including temptations, trials, weaknesses, and emotions. The purpose of the incarnation was not for Him to lose His divinity or any divine attributes but to perfectly obey the will of God the Father while living as a human being (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Philippians/2/Philippians-2-5.html"&gt;Philippians 2:5&lt;/a&gt;–11; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/2/Hebrews-2-17.html"&gt;Hebrews 2:17&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Life and Ministry of Jesus&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Jesus Christ, God the Son was conceived by the power of God the Holy Spirit and born of a virgin named Mary. He lived a perfect life without sin and grew in wisdom, stature, and favor with both God and humanity. Jesus embarked on a public ministry where He taught people about God's ways and truths. Large crowds followed Him, and He performed numerous miracles, healing people from sicknesses, diseases, and deformities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0SOJEyzdg-M" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Rejection and Crucifixion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over time, Jesus' teachings and miracles caused some religious leaders to feel threatened, leading them to seek His death. Eventually, Jesus was arrested and put on trial before Jewish and Roman authorities who sentenced Him to death. He was crucified on a cross to pay for the sins of the world. After His death, Jesus was buried in a tomb for three days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Resurrection and Salvation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the third day, Jesus rose from the dead by the power of God the Holy Spirit. His resurrection serves as the firstfruits of the new creation promised by God and guarantees the future resurrection of believers upon His return. Through His substitutionary death on the cross and resurrection, God the Son purchased eternal salvation for all those who receive Him by faith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Current Role and Future Return&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, God the Son rules and reigns as the Great High Priest at the right hand of God the Father. He is exalted above all things and intercedes before God the Father on behalf of His people. One day, He will visibly return to earth, defeat all enemies of God, and establish His kingdom where He will rule with His saints for all eternity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the nature of God the Son is essential because it reveals God's love for humanity. Through the incarnation and sacrifice of Jesus Christ, we gain access to salvation and are reconciled to God. Recognizing Jesus as fully divine and fully human helps us grasp the depth of God's love for us and enables us to have a personal relationship with Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Think About It&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider how Jesus' role as both fully divine and fully human impacts your understanding of salvation. How does this truth shape your relationship with God? Reflect on the significance of Jesus' sacrificial death on the cross and what it means for your life.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Jesus Christ/The Nature of Jesus/The Deity of Christ"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>'God with Us: The Ultimate Guide to Understanding His Presence'</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/god-with-us/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-08-22T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-08-22T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-08-22:/god-with-us/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;God with Us&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept of "God with us" is a central theme in Christianity, particularly when referring to the birth of Jesus. The phrase "God with us" originates from the prophecy of Isaiah, where it was foretold that a virgin would conceive and give birth to a son …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;God with Us&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept of "God with us" is a central theme in Christianity, particularly when referring to the birth of Jesus. The phrase "God with us" originates from the prophecy of Isaiah, where it was foretold that a virgin would conceive and give birth to a son who would be called Immanuel, meaning "God with us." This prophecy was fulfilled in the birth of Jesus, who is understood by Christians to be God in human form. The purpose of Jesus coming to earth was to reconcile humanity to God and offer salvation through his sacrificial death and resurrection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Miracle of the Incarnation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The miracle of the Incarnation refers to God taking on human flesh and becoming one of us. This is seen as the ultimate expression of God's love for humanity. In the Old Testament, God's presence was evident in various forms, such as the pillar of cloud above the tabernacle and the voice of the prophets. However, through Jesus, God was present with His people in a more personal and tangible way. Jesus is recognized as Immanuel, fulfilling the prophecy of Isaiah and demonstrating that God truly is with us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FEyRoj2sFc4" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Jesus as God with Us&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus is not just a symbol of God's presence; he is God with us in person. In the Gospel of John, it is stated that the Word (a reference to Jesus) was with God and was God Himself. Jesus became flesh and dwelt among us, revealing the glory, grace, and truth of God. When Philip asked Jesus to show them the Father, Jesus responded by saying that anyone who had seen Him had seen the Father. Jesus perfectly represented God's character and nature in everything He said and did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Purpose of the Incarnation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purpose of Jesus' incarnation was to reconcile humanity to God. The Bible teaches that all people have sinned and are separated from God. However, through Jesus, God offered a way for humanity to be reconciled to Him. Jesus came to pay the price for our sins through His death on the cross, taking upon Himself the punishment that we deserved. Through faith in Jesus and His sacrificial work, we can be forgiven and have eternal life with God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;God with Us Through the Holy Spirit&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Jesus' resurrection and ascension, He promised to send the Holy Spirit as another Helper who would be with believers forever. The Holy Spirit continues the role of Jesus as God with us. The Spirit dwells in the lives of believers, guiding, teaching, and empowering them. The presence of the Holy Spirit is a tangible manifestation of God's ongoing presence in the lives of believers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding and embracing the concept of "God with us" has significant implications for believers. It reminds us of God's love for humanity and His desire to have a relationship with us. It reassures us that we are never alone or abandoned because God is always with us through His Son, Jesus, and the Holy Spirit. Recognizing God's presence in our lives can bring comfort, guidance, and strength in times of difficulty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reflecting on the truth that God is with us can transform our perspective on life. Instead of feeling overwhelmed or hopeless, we can find peace and assurance in knowing that the Creator of the universe is intimately involved in our lives. The reality of "God with us" should inspire us to live in a way that honors and reflects His presence in our lives. It should also motivate us to share this good news with others so that they too can experience the transformative power of God's presence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, "God with us" refers to the reality of God's presence among His people, specifically through the incarnation of Jesus Christ and the indwelling of the Holy Spirit. Jesus is recognized as Immanuel, fulfilling the prophecy of Isaiah and revealing the love and grace of God to humanity. Understanding and embracing the truth of "God with us" has profound implications for believers, providing comfort, guidance, and hope in all circumstances. It reminds us of God's desire to have a personal relationship with us and calls us to live in a way that reflects His presence in our lives.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Jesus Christ/The Nature of Jesus/The Deity of Christ"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>'I AM: Discovering the Ultimate Truth in Christian Faith'</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/i-am/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-08-15T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-08-15T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-08-15:/i-am/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;The Meaning of "I AM": Understanding Jesus' Statement&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Introduction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Introduction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Bible, Jesus often referred to Himself using the phrase "I AM." This statement holds significant meaning and reveals important truths about His identity. Understanding the context and implications of Jesus' use of "I AM" helps us grasp the depth of His divinity and purpose. In this article, we will explore the meaning of Jesus' declaration and how it relates to our faith as Christians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1. The Significance of "I AM"&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Jesus said "I AM," He was using a specific phrase that carries profound theological implications. By using these words, Jesus was intentionally drawing a connection to God's self-revelation in the Old Testament. In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Exodus/3/Exodus-3-14.html"&gt;Exodus 3:14&lt;/a&gt;, God revealed His name to Moses as "I AM WHO I AM." Thus, when Jesus claimed to be the "I AM," He was asserting His divine nature and identifying Himself with Yahweh, the God of Israel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the significance of Jesus' use of "I AM" helps us recognize His divine authority and identity as God incarnate. It affirms our belief in Jesus as the Son of God and strengthens our faith in His teachings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Think About It:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider the impact of Jesus' assertion on those who heard Him speak. How would you have responded if you were present when Jesus made this statement?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2. The Bread of Life: "I AM the Bread of Life"&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/6/John-6-35.html"&gt;John 6:35&lt;/a&gt;, Jesus declared, "I am the bread of life; whoever comes to me shall not hunger, and whoever believes in me shall never thirst." By identifying Himself as the bread of life, Jesus emphasized His role in providing spiritual sustenance for humanity. Just as bread nourishes our physical bodies, Jesus offers Himself as the source of eternal life and satisfaction for our souls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus' statement invites us to come to Him, partake of His teachings, and find fulfillment in our relationship with Him. Through faith in Jesus, we receive the sustenance needed to experience true life and have our spiritual hunger satisfied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recognizing Jesus as the bread of life reminds us of our dependence on Him for spiritual nourishment and fulfillment. It encourages us to seek a deeper relationship with Him, knowing that only He can truly satisfy the longings of our hearts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Think About It:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reflect on how Jesus' statement challenges the cultural emphasis on material possessions and worldly pursuits. How does recognizing Jesus as the bread of life reshape your priorities?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;3. Light of the World: "I AM the Light of the World"&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/8/John-8-12.html"&gt;John 8:12&lt;/a&gt;, Jesus proclaimed, "I am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will not walk in darkness but will have the light of life." Jesus' claim to be the light of the world signifies His role as the source of truth, guidance, and salvation. Just as light dispels darkness, Jesus brings illumination to our lives by revealing God's truth and leading us out of spiritual darkness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XygxFVZ1HNE" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By following Jesus, we are no longer lost in the darkness of sin and ignorance. Instead, we walk in the light of His teachings and experience His transforming power in our lives. The light of Christ enables us to discern right from wrong, navigate life's challenges, and live according to God's will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding Jesus as the light of the world helps us recognize His role as our guide, illuminating the path we should walk. It reminds us to seek His truth and follow His teachings in a world filled with moral confusion and spiritual darkness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Think About It:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider how Jesus' claim to be the light of the world impacts your understanding of truth and morality. How does it influence your decision-making process?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;4. The Door: "I AM the Door"&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/10/John-10-9.html"&gt;John 10:9&lt;/a&gt;, Jesus declared, "I am the door. If anyone enters by me, he will be saved and will go in and out and find pasture." This metaphorical statement highlights Jesus' role as the exclusive entry point to salvation and eternal life. Just as a door provides access to a house, Jesus is the gateway to a restored relationship with God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By acknowledging Jesus as the door, we acknowledge that salvation cannot be attained through any other means. Only through faith in Jesus can we enter into a personal relationship with God, receiving forgiveness of sins and the assurance of eternal life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recognizing Jesus as the door to salvation reinforces our belief in the exclusivity of Christ's redemptive work. It encourages us to place our trust in Him alone for salvation and to share this truth with others who may be seeking meaning and purpose in life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Think About It:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider how Jesus' claim to be the door challenges the prevailing notion of religious pluralism. How does it shape your understanding of salvation?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;5. The Good Shepherd: "I AM the Good Shepherd"&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/10/John-10-11.html"&gt;John 10:11&lt;/a&gt;, Jesus proclaimed, "I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep." By identifying Himself as the good shepherd, Jesus emphasizes His sacrificial love and care for His followers. He contrasts Himself with hired shepherds who may abandon or neglect their sheep when faced with danger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus' role as the good shepherd assures us that He intimately knows and cares for His flock. He leads us, protects us from harm, and willingly laid down His life to save us from sin and death. As our shepherd, Jesus guides us on the path of righteousness and provides everything we need for abundant life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding Jesus as the good shepherd offers comfort and assurance in knowing that we are not alone in our journey of faith. It reminds us of His unconditional love and commitment to our well-being, even in the midst of life's challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Think About It:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reflect on how Jesus' claim to be the good shepherd challenges our tendency to rely on ourselves for guidance and protection. How does it shape your trust in Him?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;6. The Resurrection and the Life: "I AM the Resurrection and the Life"&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/11/John-11-25.html"&gt;John 11:25&lt;/a&gt;, Jesus declared, "I am the resurrection and the life. Whoever believes in me, though he die, yet shall he live." By asserting Himself as the resurrection and the life, Jesus reveals His power over death and offers hope to all who believe in Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through His death and resurrection, Jesus conquered sin and broke the power of death. He promises eternal life to those who put their faith in Him, assuring us that physical death is not the end but a transition into everlasting life with Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recognizing Jesus as the resurrection and the life instills hope and confidence in our own resurrection and eternal destiny. It assures us that death has been defeated through Christ's work on the cross, bringing comfort to those grieving the loss of loved ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Think About It:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contemplate the significance of Jesus' claim to be the resurrection and the life in light of your own mortality. How does it shape your perspective on death and eternity?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding Jesus' use of "I AM" reveals profound truths about His nature and purpose. By claiming to be the bread of life, the light of the world, the door, the good shepherd, and the resurrection and the life, Jesus emphasizes His divine identity, redemptive mission, and offer of salvation. These statements invite us to explore a deeper relationship with Him, placing our trust in Him alone for our spiritual nourishment, guidance, protection, and eternal life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Christians, may we continually reflect on the significance of Jesus' "I AM" statements, allowing them to shape our faith, inform our worldview, and inspire us to share the Good News with others.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Jesus Christ/The Nature of Jesus/The Deity of Christ"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>'Discover the Power of the Good God Alone: A Christian Journey'</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/good-god-alone/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-08-14T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-08-14T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-08-14:/good-god-alone/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Good Alone: Understanding Jesus' Claim to Divinity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Gospel of Mark, there is a passage that has been sometimes misunderstood and used to argue against the deity of Christ. In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/10/Mark-10-17.html"&gt;Mark 10:17-22&lt;/a&gt;, Jesus engages in a conversation with a rich young ruler who addresses Him as "Good …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Good Alone: Understanding Jesus' Claim to Divinity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Gospel of Mark, there is a passage that has been sometimes misunderstood and used to argue against the deity of Christ. In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/10/Mark-10-17.html"&gt;Mark 10:17-22&lt;/a&gt;, Jesus engages in a conversation with a rich young ruler who addresses Him as "Good Teacher." Some claim that Jesus' response denies His divinity. However, upon closer examination, we can see that Jesus is not denying His deity but rather challenging the man to consider the true meaning of goodness and recognize Jesus' divine identity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Understanding Jesus' Response&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the young ruler addresses Jesus as "Good Teacher," Jesus responds with a question, "Why do you call me good? No one is good except God alone" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/10/Mark-10-18.html"&gt;Mark 10:18&lt;/a&gt;). Jesus is not rebuking the man for calling Him good; rather, He is prompting him to consider the implications of his own words. Jesus wants the man to understand what it truly means for someone to be good and recognize his own lack of goodness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus' question highlights that goodness does not originate from human deeds but from God Himself. The young ruler had devoted himself to keeping the commandments, yet he failed to prioritize the greatest commandment—to love God above all else (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/22/Matthew-22-37.html"&gt;Matthew 22:37-38&lt;/a&gt;). The man's attachment to his riches revealed that he valued them more than God, thus falling short of true goodness in God's eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Following Christ: The Path to Goodness&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus uses this encounter to teach an important lesson about goodness. He invites the man to follow Him, emphasizing that true goodness can only be achieved by aligning oneself with God's ultimate standard. Following Jesus means being willing to give up everything and putting God first. By distinguishing between man's standard of goodness and God's standard, Jesus reveals that following Him is a manifestation of true goodness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The command to follow Christ is a proclamation of Jesus' own goodness. By accepting the call to follow Him, one acknowledges Jesus' divine identity. This interpretation aligns with passages such as &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/10/John-10-11.html"&gt;John 10:11&lt;/a&gt;, where Jesus refers to Himself as the "good shepherd." Furthermore, in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/8/John-8-46.html"&gt;John 8:46&lt;/a&gt;, Jesus challenges anyone to prove Him guilty of sin—a challenge that cannot be met since Jesus was without sin, holy, and undefiled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Logic of Jesus' Claim to Divinity&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZOargNFiDd4" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can summarize the logic behind Jesus' claim to divinity as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jesus asserts that only God is good.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jesus claims to be good.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Therefore, Jesus is implicitly claiming to be God.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This reasoning makes sense when we consider the overall narrative in Mark's gospel, which gradually reveals Jesus' true identity. It is only before the high priest in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/14/Mark-14-62.html"&gt;Mark 14:62&lt;/a&gt; that Jesus' identity is explicitly clarified. The story of the rich young ruler is part of a sequence of stories designed to point readers towards the understanding that Jesus is the eternal, divine, incarnate Son of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding Jesus' claim to divinity has significant implications for our faith. Jesus' divinity is a foundational belief in Christianity. By recognizing His divine nature, we affirm His authority and the unique salvation He offers. It also shapes our understanding of what it means to follow Christ and strive for true goodness in our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus' question to the rich young ruler challenges us as well. Are we willing to evaluate our own understanding of goodness? Do we prioritize God above all else? Reflecting on these questions can help us deepen our relationship with God and align our lives with His standards of goodness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, while some may interpret Jesus' response to the rich young ruler as a denial of His divinity, a closer examination reveals that He is actually prompting the man to consider true goodness and recognize Jesus' divine identity. By accepting the call to follow Him, we acknowledge Jesus' claim to be the embodiment of goodness and implicitly affirm His deity. This understanding is crucial for our faith and shapes our understanding of what it means to be a follower of Christ.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Jesus Christ/The Nature of Jesus/The Deity of Christ"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>"Unveiling the Supreme Reign of Christ: A Christian's Ultimate Guide"</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/supremacy-of-christ/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-08-10T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-08-10T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-08-10:/supremacy-of-christ/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;The Supremacy of Christ&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The supremacy of Christ is a fundamental Christian doctrine that affirms the authority and divinity of Jesus.

&lt;p&gt;The supremacy of Christ is a fundamental Christian doctrine that affirms the authority and divinity of Jesus. In simple terms, to believe in the supremacy of Christ is to acknowledge that Jesus is God. The word "supreme" means "highest in rank or authority" or "highest in degree or quality." It signifies that there is no one greater. Jesus is the ultimate in power, glory, authority, and importance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Jesus' Supremacy in Hebrews&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book of Hebrews emphasizes the work of Jesus in relation to the Old Testament system. It explains that Jesus is not just a new way of doing things; He is supreme and surpasses the old ways. The author of Hebrews compares Jesus to the temple system under the Mosaic Law, stating that Jesus' ministry is superior to theirs. The new covenant established by Jesus is based on better promises (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/8/Hebrews-8-6.html"&gt;Hebrews 8:6&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, Hebrews highlights that Jesus is not only superior to roles and systems but also to creation itself. He is described as the radiance of God's glory and the exact representation of His being, sustaining all things by His powerful word (Hebrews 1:3a). This demonstrates that Jesus is not just a man but God Himself. His supremacy extends over all creation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Supremacy of Christ in Colossians&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Colossians/1/Colossians-1-15.html"&gt;Colossians 1:15&lt;/a&gt;–23, often referred to as "The Supremacy of Christ," emphasizes that Jesus is above all things. He is called "the image of the invisible God" and "the firstborn over all creation" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Colossians/1/Colossians-1-15.html"&gt;Colossians 1:15&lt;/a&gt;). The term "firstborn" does not imply that Christ was created but rather signifies a position of authority. Paul goes on to explain that all things were created through Jesus and for Him (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Colossians/1/Colossians-1-16.html"&gt;Colossians 1:16&lt;/a&gt;). This establishes Jesus as the Creator and affirms His divinity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul further states that Jesus is before all things, holds all things together, and is the head of the Church. He is supreme over creation, death, and every aspect of life (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Colossians/1/Colossians-1-17.html"&gt;Colossians 1:17&lt;/a&gt;–18). Jesus' authority is all-encompassing, making Him unique and above all else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Significance of Jesus' Supremacy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the supremacy of Christ is essential for our view of and worship of Him. It confirms that Jesus is fully God, not just a man or a moral teacher. His sacrifice on the cross for our sins is sufficient because He is infinite and able to atone for our infinite offense against God. The supremacy of Christ also refutes the idea that there are multiple paths to God. Jesus is not just one option among many; He is the only way to salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VeKgfUGtcI0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, Jesus' supremacy reveals that we cannot rely on our own works or efforts to save ourselves. The Old Testament sacrificial system was unable to take away sins. Jesus fulfilled and replaced that system, making salvation a gift by grace through faith (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Ephesians/2/Ephesians-2-1.html"&gt;Ephesians 2:1&lt;/a&gt;–10). Our transformation into Christlikeness is only possible through the work of the Holy Spirit, not by our own strength.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The supremacy of Christ also establishes His authority over angels. He created them and is superior to them (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/1/Hebrews-1-4.html"&gt;Hebrews 1:4&lt;/a&gt;). This refutes any inclination towards angel worship. Furthermore, recognizing Jesus' authority over both the physical and spiritual realms helps us maintain a proper perspective on creation. We are called to worship Jesus alone and not creation itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the supremacy of Christ has significant implications for our faith and relationship with God. It shapes our understanding of who Jesus is, the depth of His love for us, and His sufficiency for our salvation. By acknowledging His supremacy, we acknowledge His divinity and recognize Him as the ultimate authority in our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does recognizing the supremacy of Christ impact your view of Jesus?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In what ways does the supremacy of Christ challenge the idea of multiple paths to God?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does understanding Jesus' authority over creation and the spiritual realm affect your worship and perspective on the world?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, the supremacy of Christ is a foundational Christian doctrine that affirms the authority and divinity of Jesus. It is supported by biblical passages in Hebrews and Colossians, which emphasize that Jesus is supreme over all creation, systems, and roles. Recognizing Jesus' supremacy has profound implications for our faith and relationship with God, shaping our understanding of salvation, worship, and our identity as believers.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Jesus Christ/The Nature of Jesus/The Deity of Christ"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Discover the One God of Deuteronomy 6:4 - Unveiling the Ultimate Truth</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/jesus-god-one-deuteronomy-6-4/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-08-03T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-08-03T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-08-03:/jesus-god-one-deuteronomy-6-4/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Jesus, God, and &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Deuteronomy/6/Deuteronomy-6-4.html"&gt;Deuteronomy 6:4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Deuteronomy/6/Deuteronomy-6-4.html"&gt;Deuteronomy 6:4&lt;/a&gt; states, "Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God, the LORD is one."

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Deuteronomy/6/Deuteronomy-6-4.html"&gt;Deuteronomy 6:4&lt;/a&gt; states, "Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God, the LORD is one." This verse has been foundational in Judaism and is also significant for Christians. However, some may wonder how Christianity reconciles this belief in the oneness of God with the belief that Jesus is also God. In order to understand this, we need to delve into the meaning of &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Deuteronomy/6/Deuteronomy-6-4.html"&gt;Deuteronomy 6:4&lt;/a&gt; and explore the Christian understanding of the Trinity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Meaning of "The LORD is One"&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Deuteronomy/6/Deuteronomy-6-4.html"&gt;Deuteronomy 6:4&lt;/a&gt; says "The LORD is one," it is important to note that the Hebrew word for "one" used here is "echad." This word signifies unity rather than singularity. It is also used in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/2/Genesis-2-24.html"&gt;Genesis 2:24&lt;/a&gt; to describe how a husband and wife become "one" flesh. Clearly, this does not mean they become a singular being. Instead, it emphasizes their unity with each other. Furthermore, it is worth mentioning that there is a Hebrew word that denotes absolute singularity, "yachid," but it is not used in reference to God in the Hebrew Scriptures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, when &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Deuteronomy/6/Deuteronomy-6-4.html"&gt;Deuteronomy 6:4&lt;/a&gt; says "The LORD is one," it affirms the biblical teaching of one God. It does not imply a denial of the possibility of multiple persons within the Godhead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Doctrine of the Trinity&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_DRu1aE4y-s" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Christian belief in Jesus as God does not contradict &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Deuteronomy/6/Deuteronomy-6-4.html"&gt;Deuteronomy 6:4&lt;/a&gt; because Christians understand the one true God to exist in three distinct persons: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. This belief is encapsulated in the doctrine of the Trinity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/28/Matthew-28-19.html"&gt;Matthew 28:19&lt;/a&gt;, Jesus instructs his followers to baptize new disciples in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. This indicates that all three persons are functioning as the same God. Another instance where all three persons of the Trinity are simultaneously present is during the baptism of Jesus. &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/3/Luke-3-21.html"&gt;Luke 3:21-22&lt;/a&gt; recounts how Jesus was baptized, the Holy Spirit descended upon him in the form of a dove, and a voice from heaven declared, "You are my Son, whom I love; with you I am well pleased." This event demonstrates the unity and coexistence of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Deity of Jesus&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each person of the Trinity is referred to as God in the Bible. While the Father is explicitly called God, Jesus is also referred to as God in several passages such as &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/1/John-1-1.html"&gt;John 1:1&lt;/a&gt;; 14; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/9/Romans-9-5.html"&gt;Romans 9:5&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Colossians/2/Colossians-2-9.html"&gt;Colossians 2:9&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/1/Hebrews-1-8.html"&gt;Hebrews 1:8&lt;/a&gt;–9; and &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-John/5/1-John-5-20.html"&gt;1 John 5:20&lt;/a&gt;. Likewise, the Holy Spirit is identified as God in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Acts/5/Acts-5-3.html"&gt;Acts 5:3&lt;/a&gt;–4 and &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-Corinthians/3/1-Corinthians-3-16.html"&gt;1 Corinthians 3:16&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some may argue that God cannot have a Son in the traditional sense of human procreation. However, the Father/Son relationship within the Trinity is not about biological birth but rather serves as a metaphor to help us grasp the inner workings of the Trinity. The Son and the Holy Spirit have existed eternally alongside the Father, enjoying perfect fellowship within the Trinity. In this way, God exists in both perfect unity and community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the relationship between Jesus and God is crucial for Christians because it shapes our understanding of salvation and our relationship with God. If Jesus is not truly God, then his sacrifice on the cross would not have been sufficient to atone for our sins. However, if Jesus is indeed God, then his death and resurrection hold tremendous significance for our redemption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept of the Trinity can be complex and challenging to fully comprehend. Yet, it reveals the depth and richness of God's nature. Just as a husband and wife can be united in marriage while still maintaining their individual identities, so too can the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit exist as distinct persons while being united in the Godhead. The Trinity illustrates the perfect love and unity that exists within God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Christians, we can find comfort and assurance in knowing that our salvation is secure because Jesus, as both fully human and fully divine, has accomplished our redemption. Embracing this truth deepens our relationship with God and enables us to experience the fullness of his love and grace.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Jesus Christ/The Nature of Jesus/The Deity of Christ"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>'Ultimate Revelation: God and Jesus - One Divine Entity Revealed'</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/god-jesus-same-person/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-07-15T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-07-15T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-07-15:/god-jesus-same-person/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Are God and Jesus the Same Person?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question of whether God and Jesus are the same person is a complex one that depends on how we understand the term "same person." In a theological sense, it is important to recognize that Jesus and God the Father are different persons …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Are God and Jesus the Same Person?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question of whether God and Jesus are the same person is a complex one that depends on how we understand the term "same person." In a theological sense, it is important to recognize that Jesus and God the Father are different persons within the Trinity. While they share the same divine nature and essence, they have distinct personhood. However, if the question means to ask if Jesus is truly God or if He is God in human form, then the answer is a resounding "Yes!" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Colossians/2/Colossians-2-9.html"&gt;Colossians 2:9&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Trinity: One God in Three Persons&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To understand this concept more clearly, let's delve into the doctrine of the Trinity. The Trinity teaches that there is only one God who exists in three co-equal and co-eternal persons: God the Father, God the Son (Jesus), and God the Holy Spirit. These three persons share the same essence or nature but are distinct from one another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Modalism and Trinitarianism&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is essential to address a heresy called modalism (and its modern variation called Oneness theology) that denies the existence of three Persons within the Trinity. Modalism teaches that God reveals Himself in different modes or forms, such as the Father, Son, or Holy Spirit. According to this view, Jesus and God the Father would be considered the same person. However, Trinitarians reject this perspective and maintain that Jesus and God the Father are distinct persons within the Trinity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Understanding Jesus as Fully Divine&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lVap2tUPNhQ" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To affirm that Jesus is fully divine, we can turn to passages like &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/1/John-1-1.html"&gt;John 1:1-3&lt;/a&gt;. In these verses, we learn that Jesus, referred to as the Word, was with God in the beginning and was also identified as God. This distinction between Jesus and God emphasizes their separate personhood while affirming Jesus' divine nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the relationship between God and Jesus has significant implications for our faith. Recognizing that Jesus is fully divine helps us grasp the depth of His sacrifice on the cross. If Jesus were not God, His sacrifice would not have been sufficient to atone for our sins. Additionally, acknowledging Jesus' divinity allows us to approach Him with reverence, worship, and trust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider the significance of Jesus being both fully human and fully divine. How does this impact your understanding of His role as our Savior? How does it deepen your appreciation for His sacrifice on the cross?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, while Jesus and God the Father are distinct persons within the Trinity, Jesus is fully divine. He shares the same divine nature as God and is not merely a human being. Understanding this truth is crucial to our understanding of Jesus' role as our Savior and the significance of His sacrifice on the cross.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Jesus Christ/The Nature of Jesus/The Deity of Christ"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>'Unlocking the Divine: 7 Essential Keys to the Kingdom for Christian Empowerment'</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/keys-to-the-kingdom/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-07-06T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-07-06T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-07-06:/keys-to-the-kingdom/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Keys to the Kingdom&lt;/h2&gt;

Similarly, in the New Testament, the term "Hades" has a twofold meaning …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Keys to the Kingdom&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keys serve as symbols of control and access. They grant the holder entry into locked spaces and signify authority. In ancient times, large keys were even seen as a mark of status within communities. Similarly, in the New Testament, the term "Hades" has a twofold meaning: it can refer to the place where all departed souls reside (the grave), or specifically to the place where the wicked are confined (Hell). However, it is important to note that Jesus holds the ultimate power over death and Hades. He alone possesses the "keys" and has authority over these realms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Jesus' Authority over Death and Hades&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus' victory over death is what gives Him control over who enters death and Hades. He has conquered death and emerged from the grave, making Him the sole arbiter of who enters these realms. It is crucial to understand that Satan has never possessed these keys or had any power over who goes to Heaven or Hell. The keys have always belonged to God alone, as stated in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Revelation/1/Revelation-1-18.html"&gt;Revelation 1:18&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Jesus' Triumph on the Cross&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QBQlbdpaV2w" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus did not have to fight Satan for the keys because they were never in Satan's possession. His death on the cross was His ultimate triumph, disarming all powers and authorities. &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Colossians/2/Colossians-2-15.html"&gt;Colossians 2:15&lt;/a&gt; tells us that Jesus "made a public spectacle of them [powers and authorities], triumphing over them by the cross." Through His sacrificial act, Jesus secured victory over sin and death for all believers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Way, the Truth, and the Life&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus declared Himself as the Way, the Truth, and the Life (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/14/John-14-6.html"&gt;John 14:6&lt;/a&gt;). This statement emphasizes that only through Him can individuals come to God the Father. He is the sole path to salvation and eternal life. This assertion underscores the exclusive nature of faith in Christ for attaining access to God's Kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Freedom from Fear&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Christians, there is no need to fear death or Hell. Christ has complete authority over both realms. Those who have faith in Jesus will never enter Hell. This assurance stems from the fact that Jesus holds the keys to the Kingdom and determines who enters it. Believers can find comfort in knowing that their eternal destiny rests in the hands of the One who conquered death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding Jesus' authority over death and Hades has significant implications for our faith. It reminds us that our salvation is secure in Christ alone, and we need not fear the power of death or Satan. Recognizing Jesus as the only way to God also reinforces the exclusivity of Christianity and emphasizes the importance of sharing the Gospel with others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider the significance of Jesus' triumph on the cross. How does His victory over sin and death impact your daily life? Reflect on the assurance and hope that come from knowing that Jesus holds the keys to eternal life. How does this truth shape your perspective on death and eternity?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, the concept of "keys to the kingdom" symbolizes control and access in both ancient societies and biblical texts. Jesus, through His victory on the cross, has authority over death and Hades. Satan has never possessed these keys or had any power over eternal destinies. As Christians, we can rest in the knowledge that our salvation is secure in Christ alone, who is the Way, the Truth, and the Life. Understanding Jesus' authority over death and Hades brings us comfort, confidence, and a renewed sense of purpose in sharing the message of salvation with others.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Jesus Christ/The Nature of Jesus/The Deity of Christ"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Did Jesus Claim to Be God?

&lt;h3&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many people wonder if Jesus explicitly said, "I am God." While those exact words may not be found in the Bible, Jesus did make various claims and statements that clearly conveyed His divinity. In this article, we will explore several instances where Jesus indicated His divine nature and examine the reactions of those who heard Him. Through His words, actions, miracles, and resurrection, Jesus demonstrated His identity as the Son of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Jesus and the Father are One&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/10/John-10-30.html"&gt;John 10:30&lt;/a&gt;, Jesus proclaimed, "I and the Father are one." Although He did not explicitly say, "I am God," this statement left no doubt about His divinity. The Jews who heard Him were well aware of the implications of such a claim and immediately picked up stones to stone Him for blasphemy (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/10/John-10-31.html"&gt;John 10:31&lt;/a&gt;). Their reaction clearly indicates that they understood Jesus to be equating Himself with God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/strong&gt;
Understanding Jesus' claim to be one with the Father is crucial because it reveals His divine nature. It challenges us to acknowledge that Jesus is not just a mere man but God in human form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It&lt;/strong&gt;
Imagine someone today claiming to be one with God. How would people react? How would you respond?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Before Abraham Was, I Am&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/8/John-8-58.html"&gt;John 8:58&lt;/a&gt;, Jesus made another significant statement affirming His deity. He said, "Very truly I tell you... before Abraham was born, I am!" By using the phrase "I am," Jesus intentionally echoed the name of God revealed to Moses in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Exodus/3/Exodus-3-14.html"&gt;Exodus 3:14&lt;/a&gt;. The Jews listening to Him understood that He was claiming preexistence and equating Himself with Yahweh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/strong&gt;
Jesus' use of "I am" reveals His eternal nature and further establishes His claim to be God. It demonstrates that He existed before Abraham and has divine authority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It&lt;/strong&gt;
Why do you think Jesus chose to use the phrase "I am" to describe Himself? What does this say about His relationship with God?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Word Became Flesh&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Gospel of John begins with a profound statement affirming Jesus' deity: "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/1/John-1-1.html"&gt;John 1:1&lt;/a&gt;). Here, John identifies Jesus as the Word who became flesh and dwelt among us (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/1/John-1-14.html"&gt;John 1:14&lt;/a&gt;). This passage emphasizes that Jesus is both fully God and fully human.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/strong&gt;
Recognizing Jesus as the Word made flesh helps us understand that He is not just a great teacher or prophet but God Himself, who took on human form to reveal God's glory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zylfRYiBSr4" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It&lt;/strong&gt;
How does the concept of Jesus being the Word made flesh impact your understanding of His divinity? How does it affect your relationship with Him?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Thomas' Confession&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After His resurrection, Jesus appeared to His disciples, including Thomas. When Thomas saw Jesus, he exclaimed, "My Lord and my God!" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/20/John-20-28.html"&gt;John 20:28&lt;/a&gt;). Rather than correcting Thomas for his declaration, Jesus accepted it. This interaction affirms Jesus' divinity and acknowledges that He is worthy of worship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/strong&gt;
Thomas' confession highlights the importance of recognizing Jesus as both Lord and God. It challenges us to acknowledge Jesus' rightful place in our lives and worship Him as our Savior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It&lt;/strong&gt;
How does Thomas' confession impact your own understanding of who Jesus is? How does it shape your devotion to Him?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Worshiping Jesus&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout His ministry, Jesus received worship from His disciples. For example, when He walked on water, His disciples worshiped Him (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/14/Matthew-14-33.html"&gt;Matthew 14:33&lt;/a&gt;). After His resurrection, they fell at His feet and worshiped Him (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/28/Matthew-28-9.html"&gt;Matthew 28:9&lt;/a&gt;). Jesus never rebuked them for worshiping Him but instead accepted their worship as good and proper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/strong&gt;
The disciples' worship of Jesus demonstrates their recognition of His divinity. It teaches us that worshiping Jesus is not only acceptable but also essential to our faith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It&lt;/strong&gt;
How does the disciples' worship of Jesus inspire your own worship? How does it deepen your understanding of His divinity?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Testimony of Paul and John&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New Testament, through the writings of Paul and John, further affirms Jesus' deity. Paul eagerly awaited the appearing of "our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Titus/2/Titus-2-13.html"&gt;Titus 2:13&lt;/a&gt;). Both Paul and John declare that Jesus is the Creator of the universe (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/1/John-1-3.html"&gt;John 1:3&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Colossians/1/Colossians-1-16.html"&gt;Colossians 1:16&lt;/a&gt;–17). These passages reinforce the understanding that Jesus is God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/strong&gt;
The testimony of Paul and John strengthens our confidence in Jesus' divine nature. It confirms that the early Christians recognized and proclaimed Jesus as God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It&lt;/strong&gt;
How does the testimony of Paul and John enhance your understanding of who Jesus is? How does it impact your faith in Him?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Jesus did not explicitly say, "I am God," He made numerous claims and statements that unmistakably revealed His divine nature. Through His words, actions, miracles, and resurrection, Jesus demonstrated that He is the Son of God. Understanding and accepting Jesus as God is a foundational aspect of the Christian faith. It challenges us to recognize His authority, worship Him, and place our trust in Him as our Savior and Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we reflect on these truths, may we grow in our understanding of who Jesus is and deepen our relationship with Him.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Jesus Christ/The Nature of Jesus/The Deity of Christ"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>'Unveiling the Deity of Christ: The Ultimate Truth for Christian Believers'</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/deity-of-christ/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-06-06T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-06-06T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-06-06:/deity-of-christ/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Deity of Christ&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout the Bible, there is clear evidence that Jesus is not just a human being, but also the divine Son of God. This belief in the deity of Christ is central to Christian theology. Let's explore several key points that support this understanding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1. Jesus' Claims and …&lt;/h3&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Deity of Christ&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout the Bible, there is clear evidence that Jesus is not just a human being, but also the divine Son of God. This belief in the deity of Christ is central to Christian theology. Let's explore several key points that support this understanding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1. Jesus' Claims and Disciples' Acknowledgment&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus made explicit claims about Himself that point to His divine nature. For example, He claimed to have the authority to forgive sins, which is a power reserved for God alone. His disciples also recognized Jesus' deity and referred to Him as Lord and God. Thomas famously exclaimed, "My Lord and my God!" This acknowledgment by His followers demonstrates their belief in Jesus' divine nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/strong&gt;: Understanding the deity of Christ is crucial because it establishes Jesus' authority to forgive sins and judge both the living and the dead. It also affirms that Jesus is worthy of worship and obedience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It&lt;/strong&gt;: If Jesus is not divine, then His claims to forgive sins and judge the world would be false. How does recognizing Jesus as divine impact your understanding of His significance in your life?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2. Unique Titles Given to Jesus&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the New Testament, Jesus is given titles that are uniquely attributed to YHWH (the formal name of God) in the Old Testament. For example, Jesus is referred to as the Redeemer, a title previously used only for God. He is also called Immanuel, meaning "God with us." Additionally, Scriptures from the Old Testament that speak of YHWH are applied to Jesus in the New Testament. These titles and attributions further affirm Jesus' divinity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/strong&gt;: By bestowing upon Jesus these unique titles, the Bible emphasizes His identity as God incarnate. This highlights His role as our Redeemer and reinforces the truth that God Himself came to dwell among us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It&lt;/strong&gt;: How does recognizing Jesus as Immanuel, God with us, impact your understanding of His presence in your life? How does it shape your relationship with Him?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;3. Actions and Attributes of Deity&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus performed actions that only God can do. He raised the dead, forgave sins, and even created and sustains the universe. These deeds demonstrate His divine power and authority. Moreover, Jesus possesses attributes that are exclusive to deity, such as eternality, omnipresence, omniscience, and omnipotence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/strong&gt;: Recognizing Jesus' divine actions and attributes helps us understand that He is not merely a human prophet or a great teacher. Instead, He is God in the flesh, capable of accomplishing what only God can do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It&lt;/strong&gt;: How does understanding Jesus' divine attributes impact your trust in His ability to help you and guide your life?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;4. Miracles as Evidence of Deity&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7tE9avLdDKw" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus performed numerous miracles as evidence of His claim to be God. These miracles include turning water into wine, walking on water, multiplying food, healing the sick, raising the dead, and ultimately His own resurrection. The resurrection, in particular, sets Jesus apart from other religious figures because it has substantial historical evidence supporting it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/strong&gt;: The miracles Jesus performed provide tangible proof of His divinity. They demonstrate that He has power over nature, sickness, and even death itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It&lt;/strong&gt;: How does the reality of Jesus' miracles impact your faith in Him? How does it give you confidence in His ability to work miracles in your own life?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;5. Historical Facts and Resurrection&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several historical facts surrounding Jesus that even non-Christian scholars acknowledge. These facts include Jesus' crucifixion, burial, empty tomb, disciples' belief in seeing the risen Jesus, transformation of the disciples from doubters to bold believers, and the growth of the early Church. These facts, along with the resurrection itself, provide compelling evidence for Jesus' deity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/strong&gt;: The historical facts surrounding Jesus' life and resurrection establish the foundation of the Christian faith. They demonstrate that Jesus is not just a religious figure but the Son of God who conquered death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It&lt;/strong&gt;: How does the historical evidence for Jesus' resurrection impact your confidence in the truth of Christianity? How does it shape your understanding of Jesus' deity?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;6. The Witness of the Disciples&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The disciples' willingness to die for their faith is significant evidence of Jesus' deity. People do not willingly face persecution and death for something they know to be false. The disciples' transformation from fearful and doubtful to courageous and unwavering believers can only be explained by the reality of Jesus' resurrection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/strong&gt;: The disciples' testimony serves as a powerful witness to the truth of Jesus' divinity. Their unwavering commitment to their faith, even in the face of persecution and death, underscores the profound impact Jesus had on their lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It&lt;/strong&gt;: How does the disciples' steadfastness in the face of persecution inspire you in your own faith? How does it challenge you to live boldly for Christ?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;7. The Significance of Jesus' Deity&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recognizing Jesus as divine has profound implications for our faith. It means that He is not just a moral teacher or a religious figure but God Himself. Embracing His deity allows us to experience His forgiveness, guidance, and transformative power in our lives. Furthermore, it calls us to worship and follow Him wholeheartedly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/strong&gt;: Understanding Jesus' deity enables us to fully embrace Him as our Savior and Lord. It deepens our relationship with Him and empowers us to live according to His teachings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It&lt;/strong&gt;: How does recognizing Jesus as divine impact your relationship with Him? How does it shape your worship and obedience?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, the Bible presents compelling evidence for the deity of Christ. Jesus' own claims, the acknowledgment of His disciples, unique titles given to Him, His divine actions and attributes, miracles, historical facts surrounding His life and resurrection, and the witness of the disciples all point to His divine nature. Recognizing Jesus as God incarnate is foundational to the Christian faith. It affirms His authority, power, and ability to save us. May we embrace this truth and wholeheartedly follow Him in every aspect of our lives.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Jesus Christ/The Nature of Jesus/The Deity of Christ"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>"Unleashing the Power of Jesus' Name: A Christian"'s Guide to Supernatural Authority'</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/power-in-the-name-of-jesus/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-05-24T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-05-24T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-05-24:/power-in-the-name-of-jesus/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Power in the Name of Jesus&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The power attributed to the name of Jesus originates from the person of Jesus. When we believe in Jesus' name, we are putting our trust in the finished work of the risen Christ on the cross (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-John/5/1-John-5-13.html"&gt;1 John 5:13&lt;/a&gt;). It is important to …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Power in the Name of Jesus&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The power attributed to the name of Jesus originates from the person of Jesus. When we believe in Jesus' name, we are putting our trust in the finished work of the risen Christ on the cross (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-John/5/1-John-5-13.html"&gt;1 John 5:13&lt;/a&gt;). It is important to understand that there is nothing inherently magical about the arrangement of letters in His name. The power that Christians access in Jesus' name comes from genuine faith in who Jesus is and what He has done for sinners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Power in Jesus Himself&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is crucial to recognize that any power associated with the name of Jesus is found in Jesus Christ Himself. Calling out the name of "Jesus" alone does not give us special power or a better standing with God. However, the name of Jesus holds great significance and meaning. Jesus is not just a great teacher, an enlightened man, or a worker of miracles. He is the Savior of sinners (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/1/Matthew-1-21.html"&gt;Matthew 1:21&lt;/a&gt;). The power of God, which saves, heals, protects, justifies, and redeems resides in the person of Christ, and Jesus is His name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus laid down His life to save sinners and exercised His authority to rise again (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/10/John-10-18.html"&gt;John 10:18&lt;/a&gt;). Those who call on His name in faith can receive forgiveness of sins and eternal salvation (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/10/Romans-10-13.html"&gt;Romans 10:13&lt;/a&gt;). This resurrection power is unique to Jesus alone. He is the force behind His name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Praying in Jesus' Name&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God instructs us to pray in Jesus' name (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/16/John-16-23.html"&gt;John 16:23-24&lt;/a&gt;). Praying in Jesus' name means praying with His authority and asking God the Father to act upon our prayers because we come by faith in the name of His Son, Jesus. It involves praying in line with Jesus' character and will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Praying in Jesus' name demonstrates our faith in God's power to act when we believe that Jesus' name represents who He truly is. It is not merely a grouping of letters but a representation of the person of Jesus Himself. We are invited to pray in Jesus' name with the expectation that God will answer our prayers (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/14/John-14-13.html"&gt;John 14:13-14&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Misusing the Name of Jesus&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We should be cautious not to misuse or manipulate the name of Jesus. In the Bible, there is an intriguing story about seven Jews in Ephesus who attempted to cast out demons using the name of Jesus. However, these men did not truly know Jesus or have a genuine relationship with Him. Their intentions were self-centered, seeking admiration and personal gain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The evil spirits recognized their lack of authority and mocked them by saying, "Jesus I know, and Paul I know about, but who are you?" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Acts/19/Acts-19-15.html"&gt;Acts 19:15&lt;/a&gt;). The evil spirit even empowered the possessed man to attack and overpower them. This story serves as a reminder that we cannot use the name of Jesus for our own selfish purposes. We must approach His name with reverence and respect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Name of Jesus Holds Saving Power&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The name of Jesus holds all the power of the mighty Creator Himself. Through faith in the person of Jesus, believers experience God's saving grace. The name of Jesus is the only name by which we can be saved (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Acts/4/Acts-4-12.html"&gt;Acts 4:12&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HwEXH-jIsgA" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As adopted sons and daughters into God's family, Christians participate in His power when they call on Him. The name of the Lord is like a fortified tower where the righteous can find safety (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Proverbs/18/Proverbs-18-10.html"&gt;Proverbs 18:10&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the power in the name of Jesus is crucial for every believer. It reminds us that our faith should not be placed in rituals or incantations but in a personal relationship with Jesus Christ Himself. It also emphasizes the importance of praying in alignment with His character and will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recognizing the true power behind His name helps us avoid misusing or trivializing it. Instead, we should approach the name of Jesus with reverence, respecting its significance and the authority it carries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Think About It&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you ever treated the name of Jesus as a magic word or incantation? How can you deepen your understanding of the power in His name?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In what ways can you align your prayers with the character and will of Jesus? How can you grow in faith when praying in His name?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reflect on the story of the seven sons of Sceva in Acts 19. How does this cautionary tale remind you of the importance of approaching the name of Jesus with respect and sincerity?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember, the power attributed to the name of Jesus is not in the word itself but in the person it represents. When we trust in Jesus' finished work on the cross and believe in who He is, we can access the saving power, grace, and authority that His name carries.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Jesus Christ/The Nature of Jesus/The Deity of Christ"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>'Unlocking the Divine Mystery: Understanding the Deity of Christ'</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/divinity-of-christ/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-05-18T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-05-18T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-05-18:/divinity-of-christ/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;The Divinity of Christ&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The divinity of Jesus Christ is a central belief within Christianity. Throughout the New Testament, Jesus is not only presented as the Messiah but also equated with God Himself. The apostle Paul, in his letters, refers to Jesus as our "great God and Savior" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Titus/2/Titus-2-13.html"&gt;Titus 2 …&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;The Divinity of Christ&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The divinity of Jesus Christ is a central belief within Christianity. Throughout the New Testament, Jesus is not only presented as the Messiah but also equated with God Himself. The apostle Paul, in his letters, refers to Jesus as our "great God and Savior" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Titus/2/Titus-2-13.html"&gt;Titus 2:13&lt;/a&gt;) and asserts that Jesus existed in the "form of God" before His incarnation (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Philippians/2/Philippians-2-5.html"&gt;Philippians 2:5-8&lt;/a&gt;). The book of Hebrews declares, "Your throne, O God, will last forever and ever" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/1/Hebrews-1-8.html"&gt;Hebrews 1:8&lt;/a&gt;), attributing divine authority to Jesus. Additionally, Jesus is directly identified as the Creator (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/1/John-1-3.html"&gt;John 1:3&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Colossians/1/Colossians-1-16.html"&gt;Colossians 1:16-17&lt;/a&gt;) and other passages in the Bible affirm His deity (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Revelation/1/Revelation-1-7.html"&gt;Revelation 1:7&lt;/a&gt;; 2:8; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-Corinthians/10/1-Corinthians-10-4.html"&gt;1 Corinthians 10:4&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-Peter/5/1-Peter-5-4.html"&gt;1 Peter 5:4&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Jesus as the Son of Man&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One particular self-designation of Jesus that provides evidence for His divinity is "Son of Man." This title appears multiple times in all four Gospels, indicating that it was used by Jesus Himself. In Mark 14, during His trial before the High Priest, Jesus claims to be the Son of Man from Daniel's vision. In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Daniel/7/Daniel-7-13.html"&gt;Daniel 7:13-14&lt;/a&gt;, it is stated that this Son of Man would be given dominion, glory, and an everlasting kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By referring to Himself as the Son of Man, Jesus associates Himself with this figure who possesses everlasting power and a unique authority beyond that of a mere human being. The use of this title by Jesus is significant because it is unlikely that it would have been attributed to Him if He had not used it himself. Thus, the self-designation "Son of Man" provides compelling evidence for Jesus' divine self-understanding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Actions and Worship&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus' actions and the worship He receives also point to His divinity. In Mark 2, Jesus heals a paralytic man not only to demonstrate His authority but also to show that He has the power to forgive sins. By forgiving sins, Jesus is assuming a divine prerogative that was traditionally reserved for God alone. This act challenges the Jewish audience's understanding of who Jesus is and indicates His divine nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, Jesus receives worship from various individuals and groups throughout the Gospels. He does not reject their worship but rather accepts it as appropriate. This acceptance of worship implies that Jesus understood Himself to be worthy of worship, which aligns with divine status. Jesus' teachings also emphasize His role as the judge of humanity and the importance of one's response to Him for their eternal destiny. These teachings further support Jesus' divine self-understanding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Resurrection&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The resurrection of Jesus serves as a powerful confirmation of His claims to divinity. After being crucified and buried, Jesus rose from the dead, establishing His authority and validating His teachings. Numerous contemporary sources report Jesus' post-resurrection appearances to individuals and groups under various circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact that many witnesses were willing to die for their belief in Jesus' resurrection adds credibility to this event. The theories proposed to explain away the resurrection, such as the Hallucination Theory, have failed to account for all the known data. The resurrection of Jesus is an established historical fact and serves as the strongest evidence for His divinity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MYQz-8flxsQ" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Understanding the divinity of Christ is essential for Christians as it forms the foundation of their faith. Believing in Jesus as fully divine affirms His role as Savior and Lord. It demonstrates that salvation comes through faith in Him alone and acknowledges Him as the ultimate authority in our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recognizing Jesus' divinity also provides assurance of His power and ability to forgive sins. It assures believers that Jesus is not merely a moral teacher or a good example but a divine being who has the authority to offer forgiveness and grant eternal life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contemplating the divinity of Christ challenges us to consider the implications of who Jesus claimed to be. If Jesus truly is divine, then our response to Him is of utmost importance. It calls us to examine our beliefs, attitudes, and actions in light of His teachings and to surrender our lives to Him as our Lord and Savior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The divinity of Christ also invites us to reflect on the significance of His resurrection. If Jesus conquered death and rose from the dead, it validates His claims and offers hope for eternal life. It prompts us to consider the reality of life beyond this world and the importance of our relationship with Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the divinity of Christ is a foundational belief that shapes the Christian faith. It is through understanding and embracing this truth that we can experience the fullness of salvation, forgiveness, and eternal life in Him.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Jesus Christ/The Nature of Jesus/The Deity of Christ"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>'Unveiling the Holiness of Christ: A Divine Encounter'</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/holiness-of-christ/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-05-12T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-05-12T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-05-12:/holiness-of-christ/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Holiness of Christ&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The holiness of Christ is a fundamental aspect of His nature and character. It encompasses both His absolute moral purity and His divine status as the Son of God. Understanding the holiness of Christ requires a proper understanding of His deity and His role as the Savior of humanity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1. Definition of Holiness&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Holiness can be defined in two primary ways. First, it refers to absolute moral purity and righteousness, untainted by sin or error. God, who is holy, exemplifies this standard of perfection. Second, holiness also refers to being set apart for God's purpose. This can be seen in the example of the temple in Jerusalem, which was considered "holy" because it was dedicated to God's worship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2. The Holiness of Christ and His Deity&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The holiness of Christ is closely tied to His deity. Jesus claimed to be God, accepted worship, and declared His unity with the Father. The apostle John testified to Jesus' divinity in his gospel account, stating that Jesus is the Word who was with God and was God. Christ's holiness is an inherent part of His divine nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;3. Misunderstandings about the Holiness of Christ&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Various misunderstandings exist regarding the person and nature of Christ Jesus. Some view Him merely as a historic figure, a prophet, or a moral teacher. Others believe He is an angel or a spiritual brother of Lucifer. However, these perspectives fail to acknowledge His true identity as both fully God and fully man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;4. Awe and Respect for the Holy One&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The holiness of Christ demands awe and respect from humanity. While Jesus draws us to Himself with love and compassion, we must never treat Him as an equal. His unparalleled goodness and radiant glory contrast sharply with our fallen state. Approaching Him in a flippant or careless manner is dishonorable. Instead, we should approach Him with reverence and adoration, recognizing His authority and majesty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;5. Fear and Awe in the Presence of Christ&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The encounter between Jesus and Simon Peter on the Lake of Galilee illustrates the mixture of attraction and fear that arises from the holiness of Christ. When Jesus performed a miraculous catch of fish, Peter fell at His feet in fear, recognizing his own sinfulness in contrast to Christ's holiness. This experience reveals the natural response of sinful humanity when faced with the presence of the Holy One.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;6. The Invitation of Christ&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite our sinfulness, Christ invites us to come to Him for rest and salvation. He does not recoil from our wickedness but extends His love and grace to us. Through faith in Him as our Savior, we are transformed from children of wrath into beloved sons and daughters of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the holiness of Christ is crucial because it shapes our perception of who He is and how we relate to Him. Recognizing His holiness helps us approach Him with awe, reverence, and respect. It also emphasizes the need for salvation through faith in Him as the only One capable of forgiving our sins and reconciling us to God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider your own understanding of the holiness of Christ. How does this understanding impact your relationship with Him? In what ways can you cultivate a greater sense of reverence and awe for the Holy One? Reflect on the invitation Jesus extends to you to come to Him for rest and salvation.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Jesus Christ/The Nature of Jesus/The Deity of Christ"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>'Emmanuel: Understanding the Divine Concept of God Incarnate'</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/god-incarnate/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-05-07T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-05-07T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-05-07:/god-incarnate/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;God Incarnate&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Jesus' Nature as Both Man and God&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;God Incarnate&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept of God incarnate refers to the belief that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, took on a human form while still retaining His divine nature. This is a foundational doctrine of Christianity and is supported by biblical teachings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Jesus' Nature as Both Man and God&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we say that Jesus is God incarnate, we mean that He took on a fleshly, bodily form while still being fully divine. In other words, Jesus became fully human but did not stop being deity. This is a mystery of Christianity and a test of orthodoxy. Jesus has two distinct natures, divine and human. The Bible clearly teaches the deity of Christ through various ways: the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies, His eternal existence, His miraculous virgin birth, His authority to forgive sins, His acceptance of worship, His ability to predict the future, and His resurrection from the dead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Incarnation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Incarnation refers to Jesus becoming fully human by taking on human flesh. He was conceived in the womb and born like any other human being. Jesus experienced normal aging, had physical needs and emotions, learned, died a physical death, and was resurrected with a physical body. However, unlike all other humans, Jesus lived a completely sinless life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Position Change&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Jesus took on human form, His nature did not change but His position did. In His original nature as God in spirit form, He humbled Himself by laying aside His glory and privileges. It is important to note that God cannot stop being God because He is immutable and infinite. If Jesus stopped being fully God for even a split second, all life would cease to exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ITEzXLcpKZs" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the concept of God incarnate is crucial for Christians because it speaks to the central message of the gospel. Jesus' incarnation allows Him to bridge the gap between humanity and divinity, making salvation possible. By becoming fully human, Jesus was able to live a sinless life and offer Himself as the perfect sacrifice for our sins. His death and resurrection provide the means for reconciliation with God and eternal life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Think About It&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea of God becoming a human being may seem difficult to comprehend. How can someone be both fully human and fully divine at the same time? It is important to remember that some aspects of our faith are beyond our full understanding. However, this does not mean that we cannot have confidence in the truth of God's Word. The mystery of the Incarnation invites us to reflect on the greatness of God and His love for us. It also reminds us that God is willing to meet us where we are, in our humanity, in order to redeem us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, the concept of God incarnate is a fundamental belief in Christianity. Jesus Christ, while remaining fully God, took on human form to save humanity from sin and restore our relationship with God. This doctrine is supported by biblical teachings and is central to the message of the gospel. While it may be challenging to fully comprehend, we can trust in the truth of God's Word and embrace the mystery of the Incarnation as a demonstration of God's love and grace towards us.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Jesus Christ/The Nature of Jesus/The Deity of Christ"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>Is Jesus Truly God?

&lt;p&gt;Many people wonder whether Jesus is truly God. While the Bible does not include a direct statement from Jesus saying, "I am God," there are several passages that strongly indicate His divine nature. For example, in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/10/John-10-30.html"&gt;John 10:30&lt;/a&gt;, Jesus declares, "I and the Father are one …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Is Jesus God?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many people wonder whether Jesus is truly God. While the Bible does not include a direct statement from Jesus saying, "I am God," there are several passages that strongly indicate His divine nature. For example, in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/10/John-10-30.html"&gt;John 10:30&lt;/a&gt;, Jesus declares, "I and the Father are one." The Jews who heard this statement understood that He was claiming to be God, and they wanted to stone Him for blasphemy. Likewise, in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/8/John-8-58.html"&gt;John 8:58&lt;/a&gt;, Jesus says, "Before Abraham was born, I am!" This references &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Exodus/3/Exodus-3-14.html"&gt;Exodus 3:14&lt;/a&gt; when God revealed Himself as the "I AM." The Jews again sought to kill Jesus for blasphemy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept of Jesus' deity is reiterated throughout the New Testament. In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/1/John-1-1.html"&gt;John 1:1&lt;/a&gt; and 14, we read that "the Word [Jesus] was God" and "the Word became flesh," indicating that Jesus is God in human form. &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Acts/20/Acts-20-28.html"&gt;Acts 20:28&lt;/a&gt; tells us that the church was purchased with the blood of God, referring to Jesus. Furthermore, in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/1/Hebrews-1-8.html"&gt;Hebrews 1:8&lt;/a&gt;, the Father acknowledges Jesus as God when He says, "'Your throne, O God, will last forever and ever.'"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even Thomas the disciple recognized Jesus as God when he exclaimed, "My Lord and my God" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/20/John-20-28.html"&gt;John 20:28&lt;/a&gt;), and Jesus did not correct him. Additionally, &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Titus/2/Titus-2-13.html"&gt;Titus 2:13&lt;/a&gt; encourages believers to await the coming of "our God and Savior, Jesus Christ." In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Revelation/19/Revelation-19-10.html"&gt;Revelation 19:10&lt;/a&gt;, an angel instructs John to worship only God. However, throughout the Gospels and other New Testament books, we find instances where people worship Jesus without Him rebuking them. If Jesus were not God, He would have surely corrected them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most crucial reasons why Jesus must be God is that His death would not have been sufficient to pay for the sins of the world if He were not God. Only God could pay an infinite penalty for sin against an infinite God. Jesus, being God incarnate, was able to take on the sins of the world, die, and be resurrected, triumphing over sin and death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding that Jesus is God is essential for our faith. If Jesus were merely a created being, He would not have been able to pay the price for our sins. As believers, we need assurance that our Savior is fully divine and capable of providing us with eternal salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider the implications of Jesus' claim to be God. How does this affect your understanding of His work on the cross and the significance of His resurrection? How does it shape your relationship with Him? Take time to reflect on the profound truth that Jesus is God, and let it deepen your faith in Him.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Jesus Christ/The Nature of Jesus/The Deity of Christ"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry></feed>

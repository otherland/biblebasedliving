&lt;p&gt;The concept of being "a little lower than the angels" is found in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/8/Psalm-8-5.html"&gt;Psalm 8:5&lt;/a&gt;, and it holds significant implications for our understanding of Jesus Christ. In this verse, the psalmist ponders the greatness of God's creation and asks, "What is man that you …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Little Lower Than the Angels&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept of being "a little lower than the angels" is found in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/8/Psalm-8-5.html"&gt;Psalm 8:5&lt;/a&gt;, and it holds significant implications for our understanding of Jesus Christ. In this verse, the psalmist ponders the greatness of God's creation and asks, "What is man that you are mindful of him, and the son of man that you care for him?" The psalmist goes on to acknowledge that God has made humanity "a little lower than the heavenly beings" and has crowned them with glory and honor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Original Meaning&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To grasp the original meaning of this verse, we need to consider its context. In Hebrew, the term "heavenly beings" can also be translated as "angel." Therefore, &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/8/Psalm-8-5.html"&gt;Psalm 8:5&lt;/a&gt; suggests that God has made humanity slightly lower than the angels. The following verse, &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/8/Psalm-8-6.html"&gt;Psalm 8:6&lt;/a&gt;, further emphasizes that God has given mankind dominion over His creation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This understanding aligns with &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/1/Genesis-1-26.html"&gt;Genesis 1:26-28&lt;/a&gt;, which reveals that God gave humanity authority over the created world. Adam, as the representative head of the human race, was created "a little lower than the angels." Despite this positioning, Adam was still crowned with glory and honor because he was made in the image of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Jesus as the Second Adam&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/2/Hebrews-2-6.html"&gt;Hebrews 2:6-8&lt;/a&gt; quotes &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/8/Psalm-8-5.html"&gt;Psalm 8:5&lt;/a&gt; and expands upon its significance. The author of Hebrews applies this verse to Jesus Christ, identifying Him as the "son of man" mentioned in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/8/Psalm-8-4.html"&gt;Psalm 8:4&lt;/a&gt;. By doing so, Hebrews emphasizes Jesus' connection to Adam as the representative head of humanity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus is referred to as the Second Adam or the new Adam who came to deal directly with the consequences brought upon mankind by the first Adam. This includes conquering death, which the first Adam could never accomplish (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-Corinthians/15/1-Corinthians-15-45.html"&gt;1 Corinthians 15:45&lt;/a&gt;). The Gospel of Luke also emphasizes Jesus as the Son of Man, the one who came to deliver mankind from death through His crucifixion, burial, and resurrection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Jesus' Incarnation and Humility&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/F__lEJ3A0GM" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus, in His incarnation, took on sinless flesh and willingly became "a little lower than the angels." &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Philippians/2/Philippians-2-7.html"&gt;Philippians 2:7&lt;/a&gt; describes how Jesus "made himself nothing by taking the very nature of a servant" when He took on human form. He subjected Himself to the Law and lived in perfect obedience (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Galatians/4/Galatians-4-4.html"&gt;Galatians 4:4&lt;/a&gt;). Jesus, who was rich, became poor for our sake (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/2-Corinthians/8/2-Corinthians-8-9.html"&gt;2 Corinthians 8:9&lt;/a&gt;). In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/20/Matthew-20-28.html"&gt;Matthew 20:28&lt;/a&gt;, Jesus declared that He came not to be served but to serve and give His life as a ransom for many.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The angels themselves marvel at the Incarnation and desire to understand the gospel more fully (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-Peter/1/1-Peter-1-12.html"&gt;1 Peter 1:12&lt;/a&gt;). Despite becoming "a little lower than the angels," Jesus never ceased to be God. He displayed the meekness and condescension of God while remaining fully divine. After His atoning work on the cross, Jesus was crowned with glory and honor. He is now seated at the right hand of God the Father (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Colossians/3/Colossians-3-1.html"&gt;Colossians 3:1&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Exaltation of Jesus&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Jesus was made lower than the angels for a temporary period, &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/2/Hebrews-2-7.html"&gt;Hebrews 2:7&lt;/a&gt; assures us that He is now exalted above all angels. &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Philippians/2/Philippians-2-9.html"&gt;Philippians 2:9-11&lt;/a&gt; declares that every knee will bow before Him, and every tongue will confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God the Father.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Believers in Christ will also reign with Him in the future millennium. As the Second Adam, Christ will accomplish what the first Adam and his descendants failed to achieve due to sin. &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/2/Hebrews-2-8.html"&gt;Hebrews 2:8&lt;/a&gt; hints at this by pointing out the subjection of all things to Christ. The curse will be reversed, and believers will share in Christ's glory forever, dwelling with Him in the new heaven and new earth (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/65/Isaiah-65-17.html"&gt;Isaiah 65:17-25&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding Jesus' role as the Second Adam and His humility in becoming "a little lower than the angels" is crucial for Christians. It highlights Jesus' humanity and His unique ability to represent humanity before God. Jesus' incarnation and sacrificial death on the cross provide the means for our redemption and salvation. Without Jesus' willingness to humble Himself and take on human form, there would be no hope of salvation for any of us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contemplating Jesus' humility can inspire us to adopt a servant mindset. Just as Jesus came not to be served but to serve, we are called to follow His example. We should consider how we can humbly serve others, imitating Jesus' selflessness in our interactions with those around us. Additionally, reflecting on Jesus' exaltation reminds us of the ultimate victory that awaits believers in Christ. It encourages us to persevere in faith, knowing that our future is secure and that we will share in Christ's glory forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/8/Psalm-8-5.html"&gt;Psalm 8:5&lt;/a&gt; speaks of humanity being "a little lower than the angels," which finds its fulfillment in Jesus Christ as the Second Adam. Jesus willingly took on human form, experiencing humility and ultimately achieving victory over sin and death. Understanding this truth deepens our appreciation for Jesus' sacrifice and underscores the importance of imitating His humility and service to others.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Jesus Christ/The Nature of Jesus/Humanity"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>'Unveiling the Divine Mystery: The Incarnation of Christ Explained'</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/incarnation-of-christ/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-09-15T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-09-15T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-09-15:/incarnation-of-christ/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;The Incarnation of Christ&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The incarnation of Christ is a term used by theologians to describe the belief that Jesus, the Son of God, took on human flesh. This concept is closely related to the hypostatic union, which explains how Jesus' two natures, divine and human, are joined together. However, the incarnation specifically emphasizes Jesus' humanity. The word "incarnation" itself means "the act of being made flesh," and it comes from the Latin version of &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/1/John-1-14.html"&gt;John 1:14&lt;/a&gt;, which reads in English as "The Word became flesh and made His dwelling among us." This Latin term became widely used due to the prevalence of the Latin Vulgate translation in the church during the Middle Ages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Jesus' Humanity in the Bible&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biblical support for Jesus' humanity is extensive. The Gospels report various aspects of Jesus' humanity, such as his need for sleep (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/8/Luke-8-23.html"&gt;Luke 8:23&lt;/a&gt;), food (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/4/Matthew-4-2.html"&gt;Matthew 4:2&lt;/a&gt;; 21:18), and physical protection (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/2/Matthew-2-13.html"&gt;Matthew 2:13-15&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/10/John-10-39.html"&gt;John 10:39&lt;/a&gt;). Additionally, there are instances where Jesus perspired (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/22/Luke-22-43.html"&gt;Luke 22:43-44&lt;/a&gt;) and bled (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/19/John-19-34.html"&gt;John 19:34&lt;/a&gt;). He also expressed a range of emotions, including joy (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/15/John-15-11.html"&gt;John 15:11&lt;/a&gt;), sorrow (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/26/Matthew-26-37.html"&gt;Matthew 26:37&lt;/a&gt;), and anger (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/3/Mark-3-5.html"&gt;Mark 3:5&lt;/a&gt;). Throughout his life, Jesus referred to himself as a man (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/8/John-8-40.html"&gt;John 8:40&lt;/a&gt;), and even after his resurrection, his humanity was still recognized (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Acts/2/Acts-2-22.html"&gt;Acts 2:22&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EUNybu7PkDU" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The Purpose of the Incarnation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the purpose of the incarnation was not merely for Jesus to experience human needs or emotions. The Son of God came in the flesh to be the Savior of mankind. First and foremost, it was necessary for him to be born "under the law" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Galatians/4/Galatians-4-4.html"&gt;Galatians 4:4&lt;/a&gt;). All humans have failed to fulfill God's law, and Christ came in the flesh to fulfill the law on our behalf (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/5/Matthew-5-17.html"&gt;Matthew 5:17&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Galatians/4/Galatians-4-5.html"&gt;Galatians 4:5&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, the Savior needed to shed his blood for the forgiveness of sins (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/9/Hebrews-9-22.html"&gt;Hebrews 9:22&lt;/a&gt;). A blood sacrifice requires a body of flesh and blood. This was God's plan for the incarnation, as stated in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/10/Hebrews-10-5.html"&gt;Hebrews 10:5&lt;/a&gt;, "When Christ came into the world, he said: 'Sacrifice and offering you did not desire, but a body you prepared for me.'" Without the incarnation, Christ could not truly die, and the significance of the cross would be meaningless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the incarnation of Christ is crucial for Christians because it reveals the depths of God's love and mercy towards humanity. Through the incarnation, God became fully human in Jesus Christ, experiencing all that we experience while remaining fully divine. This allows us to have a personal relationship with God and find hope in our struggles, knowing that Jesus understands our human condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the incarnation demonstrates God's commitment to fulfilling his promises and providing salvation to humanity. Jesus' birth under the law and his sacrificial death on the cross are central to the Christian faith. By taking on human flesh, Jesus became the perfect sacrifice who paid the price for our sins and reconciled us with God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The incarnation challenges us to reflect on our own lives and how we relate to Jesus as both fully human and fully divine. It reminds us that Jesus' humanity means he can empathize with our weaknesses and understand our struggles. We can approach him with confidence, knowing that he experienced life on earth just like we do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, considering the purpose of the incarnation should inspire us to live in gratitude and obedience to God. Jesus willingly took on human form to fulfill God's plan for our salvation. This should motivate us to respond with love, obedience, and a desire to share the good news of Christ's incarnation with others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, the incarnation of Christ is a foundational belief in Christianity that affirms Jesus' humanity. It emphasizes that Jesus, the Son of God, took on human flesh to fulfill the law and offer himself as a sacrificial payment for our sins. Understanding the incarnation deepens our appreciation for God's love and mercy towards humanity and calls us to respond with gratitude and obedience.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Jesus Christ/The Nature of Jesus/Humanity"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>The Ultimate Guide to Understanding Incarnation Immutability in Christian Doctrine</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/incarnation-immutability/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-07-17T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-07-17T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-07-17:/incarnation-immutability/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Incarnation Immutability&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The concept of the incarnation immutability is a theological topic that has been debated and discussed by many great minds throughout history. It involves understanding the nature of Jesus Christ, particularly in relation to his divine and human natures. In order to grasp this complex concept, we must refer to the affirmations of Scripture and examine the teachings of early theologians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus' Divinity and Humanity:
The Bible clearly affirms both the divinity and humanity of Jesus Christ. Various passages explicitly assert his divinity, such as &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/1/John-1-1.html"&gt;John 1:1&lt;/a&gt;, while others imply it through his divine actions like forgiving sins and creating the cosmos. On the other hand, scriptural evidence also demonstrates Jesus' humanity, as he experienced suffering, death, and weaknesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Incarnation:
When the "Word became flesh" (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/1/John-1-14.html"&gt;John 1:14&lt;/a&gt;), Jesus did not become two separate beings (one divine and one human), but rather one person with two distinct natures - fully divine and fully human. This union of God's nature with sinless human nature took place without any changes to His divine nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Immutability of Jesus' Divine Nature:
Jesus' divine nature is unchanging, infinite, and ever-supreme in every way. As God, He is immutable and perfect, incapable of degrading into a worse state or improving into a better state. There is no room for improvement or change in God's perfection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aBwex8Ul1mk" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Changeability of Jesus' Human Nature:
In contrast to His divine nature, Jesus' human nature is changeable and subject to weakness. As a human being, He was able to suffer, die, and experience limitations both physically and emotionally. We see evidence of this in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/2/Luke-2-52.html"&gt;Luke 2:52&lt;/a&gt; where it states that Jesus "grew in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and men."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Mystery of the Incarnation:
The fourth and fifth-century theologians grappled with the challenge of explaining the full extent of the Incarnation. While they couldn't fully comprehend or explain it, they affirmed what Scripture taught about Jesus being both human and divine. They acknowledged that aspects of the Incarnation are a mysterious wonder, but they avowed what God had revealed to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Significance of the Incarnation:
The mystery of the Incarnation holds great significance for our salvation. Jesus Christ, as God incarnate, serves as the perfect mediator between humanity and God. As God, He perfectly represents God to us, and as a human, He serves as our advocate before God the Father. Through His sacrificial death and resurrection, He makes peace on our behalf and offers forgiveness for our sins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt;
Understanding the concept of incarnation immutability is essential for Christians because it helps us grasp the fullness of who Jesus Christ is - both fully divine and fully human. This understanding enables us to appreciate the significance of His sacrifice on the cross and His role as our mediator with God. It also reminds us of the depth of God's love for us, that He would enter into our human experience to bring about our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think About It:&lt;/strong&gt;
Reflecting on the mystery of the Incarnation can deepen our awe and gratitude towards God. Consider how Jesus' simultaneous divinity and humanity impact your understanding of His teachings and actions in the Gospels. How does this knowledge influence your relationship with Him and your appreciation for His sacrifice on your behalf?&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Jesus Christ/The Nature of Jesus/Humanity"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>'Understanding Jesus Son of Man: Unveiling the Divine Humanity'</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/jesus-son-of-man/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-06-21T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-06-21T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-06-21:/jesus-son-of-man/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Jesus: The Son of Man&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus is often referred to as the "Son of Man" in the New Testament. This title is used 82 times and was the primary way Jesus referred to Himself. While other titles for Jesus, such as Son of God, emphasize His deity, Son of Man focuses on His humanity. In fact, the phrase "Son of Man" is a term used to describe any human being. However, when applied to Jesus, it carries a significant meaning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus, the Son of Man, is the perfect embodiment of what God intended humanity to be. He is the supreme example of truth and grace. In Him, "all the fullness of the Deity lives in bodily form." (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Colossians/2/Colossians-2-9.html"&gt;Colossians 2:9&lt;/a&gt;) Jesus' incarnation as the Son of Man showcases His humility and willingness to lower Himself from His heavenly glory to identify with humanity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout His life on Earth, Jesus experienced the limitations and struggles of being human. He was born in a humble manger and lived a life without earthly possessions. Jesus associated with sinners, ate and drank with them, and ultimately suffered at the hands of men. This intentional choice to become the Son of Man demonstrates His deep love for humanity and His desire to save us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One significant moment where Jesus referred to Himself as the Son of Man was during His trial before the high priest. He quoted a prophecy from &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Daniel/7/Daniel-7-13.html"&gt;Daniel 7:13-14&lt;/a&gt;, which speaks of a figure who comes with the clouds of heaven and receives dominion, glory, and an everlasting kingdom. By applying this prophecy to Himself, Jesus claimed that He is the Son of Man who will rule over all things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0SOJEyzdg-M" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The Humanity and Deity of Jesus&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus is not only fully human but also fully God. He existed eternally as the Second Person of the Trinity before taking on human flesh. The Gospel of John describes Jesus as the Word who was with God and was God from the beginning. (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/1/John-1-1.html"&gt;John 1:1&lt;/a&gt;) And the same Word became flesh and dwelt among us. (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/1/John-1-14.html"&gt;John 1:14&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The combination of Jesus' humanity and deity is a crucial aspect of Christian theology. It allows Him to fulfill the role of our Savior. As fully human, He can sympathize with our weaknesses and understand our struggles. As fully God, He has the power and authority to forgive sins, execute judgment, and offer eternal salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Role of the Son of Man&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus, as the Son of Man, came with a specific purpose. He came to save lives, rise from the dead, and execute judgment. Throughout His ministry, Jesus demonstrated His authority over sin, death, and all aspects of creation. He performed miracles, taught with authority, and ultimately sacrificed Himself on the cross to reconcile humanity with God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Son of Man is also portrayed as the Lord of the Sabbath. Jesus challenged the religious leaders' legalistic understanding of the Sabbath by emphasizing its true purpose: to bring rest and restoration to people's lives. He revealed that He is the ultimate source of rest and salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding Jesus as the Son of Man is crucial for our faith. It reminds us that Jesus willingly humbled Himself to identify with us in every way. He experienced the limitations and challenges of being human while remaining fully God. This truth gives us assurance that we have a Savior who understands our struggles and empathizes with our weaknesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recognizing Jesus as the Son of Man also highlights His authority and power. As the one who will execute judgment, He calls us to surrender our lives to Him and follow His teachings. Knowing that Jesus will establish an everlasting kingdom encourages us to live with a sense of hope and anticipation for His return.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does understanding Jesus as both fully human and fully God impact your relationship with Him?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In what ways can you identify with the struggles and limitations that Jesus experienced as the Son of Man?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reflect on the humility of Jesus in becoming the Son of Man. How can you emulate His humility in your own life?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, Jesus being referred to as the Son of Man emphasizes His humanity and His supreme example of what God intended mankind to be. Despite being fully God, Jesus willingly took on human flesh to identify with us and save us. Recognizing Jesus as the Son of Man reminds us of His authority, power, and His future role as the ruler of an everlasting kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Jesus Christ/The Nature of Jesus/Humanity"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>'Revealing the Divine Humanity of Jesus: A Christian Exploration'</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/humanity-of-jesus/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-06-15T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-06-15T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-06-15:/humanity-of-jesus/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;The Humanity of Jesus&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The humanity of Jesus is a vital aspect of His identity, alongside His deity. Although it can be challenging for our finite minds to comprehend, the Bible affirms that Jesus was fully God and fully human. It is crucial to reject false views that either deny His divinity or His humanity, as both are biblical truths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Jesus as a Human Being&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus was born as a human being to fulfill God's plan of redemption. &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Galatians/4/Galatians-4-4.html"&gt;Galatians 4:4&lt;/a&gt;–5 explains that God sent His Son, born of a woman and under the law, to redeem those under the law. By being born as a human, Jesus could fulfill the requirements of the law on behalf of humanity. Only a perfect human, without sin, could perfectly keep and fulfill the law. Through His sacrificial death on the cross, Jesus exchanged our sin for His perfect righteousness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Necessity of Jesus' Humanity&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several reasons why Jesus had to be fully human. Firstly, God established the shedding of blood as necessary for the forgiveness of sins (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Leviticus/17/Leviticus-17-11.html"&gt;Leviticus 17:11&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/9/Hebrews-9-22.html"&gt;Hebrews 9:22&lt;/a&gt;). While animal sacrifices foreshadowed the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus, they were insufficient to permanently remove sin. Jesus, as the perfect Lamb of God, sacrificed His own human life and shed His blood to cover the sins of all who believe in Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/R9qoqQ75ifs" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, Jesus' humanity enabled Him to be tempted just like we are. &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/4/Hebrews-4-15.html"&gt;Hebrews 4:15&lt;/a&gt; asserts that Jesus was tempted in every way as we are, yet He was without sin. By experiencing human trials and temptations firsthand, Jesus can sympathize with our weaknesses and understand our struggles. This truth gives us confidence that He is a compassionate and understanding high priest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Significance of Jesus' Incarnation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Declaring that Jesus has come in the flesh is an essential mark of being led by the Spirit of God (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-John/4/1-John-4-2.html"&gt;1 John 4:2&lt;/a&gt;–3). The Antichrist and those who follow him will deny this truth. Jesus indeed came in the flesh, sinlessly experiencing our human frailties. His human blood was shed for our sins, and He was fully God and fully Man. These biblical truths cannot be denied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the humanity of Jesus is crucial for several reasons. Firstly, it reveals the depth of God's love and His desire to identify with humanity. Jesus willingly took on human form to redeem us and restore our relationship with God. Secondly, Jesus' humanity enables Him to empathize with us and intercede on our behalf as a compassionate high priest. Knowing that Jesus has experienced the same trials and temptations as us gives us comfort and assurance in our faith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The humanity of Jesus challenges us to reflect on the significance of His incarnation. It compels us to consider the immense sacrifice He made by becoming one of us, enduring suffering, and ultimately laying down His life for our salvation. Moreover, it reminds us that Jesus understands our struggles intimately and invites us to approach Him boldly in times of need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, the humanity of Jesus is a fundamental aspect of His identity. He was born as a human being while remaining fully divine. His humanity allowed Him to fulfill the requirements of the law and serve as the perfect sacrifice for our sins. By experiencing human trials and temptations, Jesus can sympathize with our weaknesses and intercede on our behalf. Recognizing the humanity of Jesus deepens our understanding of God's love and encourages us to approach Him confidently in our times of need.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Jesus Christ/The Nature of Jesus/Humanity"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry><entry><title>"Unveiling Jesus' Sinful Flesh Likeness: A Profound Christian Revelation"</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/jesus-likeness-sinful-flesh/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-06-06T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-06-06T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-06-06:/jesus-likeness-sinful-flesh/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Jesus in the Likeness of Sinful Flesh&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The concept of Jesus coming in the likeness of sinful flesh is found in &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/8/Romans-8-3.html"&gt;Romans 8:3&lt;/a&gt;–4. This passage states that God sent His own Son, Jesus, in the likeness of sinful flesh to be a sin offering. By doing this, God condemned sin in the flesh and fulfilled the righteous requirement of the law. To fully understand what it means for Jesus to come in the likeness of sinful flesh, we need to define a few terms and explore their significance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Meaning of "The Flesh"&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the Bible refers to "the flesh," it generally refers to the human tendency to sin that we all inherited from Adam. In other words, it represents our fallen nature. When Adam and Eve rebelled against God's commandment in the Garden of Eden, sin entered the world, corrupting everything. As descendants of Adam, we have all inherited this fallen nature, and therefore, we are all born as sinners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Likeness of Sinful Flesh&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word "likeness" means resemblance or similarity. It signifies that something is not identical in substance or nature but shares a resemblance or appearance with something else. In the case of Jesus, He took on the likeness of humanity by becoming fully human while retaining His divinity. He entered into our human experience, living the life we live, suffering as we suffer, and growing as we grow. However, unlike every other human being, Jesus did not inherit a sin nature because He did not have an earthly father. His conception was miraculous, with Mary being overshadowed by the Holy Spirit (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/1/Luke-1-35.html"&gt;Luke 1:35&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Jesus as Our Substitute&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus came in the likeness of sinful flesh to be our substitute. He willingly took on physical pain, emotional rejection, and spiritual separation from God. He lived a perfect life without sinning and maintained perfect fellowship with God. By doing so, He presented Himself as the final sacrifice sufficient to pay for the sins of all humanity. Jesus' sacrifice on the cross and His resurrection provide the means for us to receive forgiveness and reconciliation with God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wOkB6cxVXTc" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Receiving the Gift of Salvation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To receive the gift of salvation, we must acknowledge Jesus as our personal substitute. We come to Him in faith, recognizing that His sacrifice paid for our sins in full. Through faith in Jesus, our sinful flesh is crucified with Him, and we are set free to follow the guidance of the Holy Spirit and live in obedience to God. As Christians, we have Christ's death and resurrection credited to our account, wiping out the debt we owe to God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding that Jesus came in the likeness of sinful flesh is crucial because it reveals God's plan for our redemption. Jesus' sinless life and sacrificial death provide the way for us to be reconciled with God and experience eternal life. It underscores the seriousness of sin and highlights the incredible love and mercy of God in providing a substitute for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think About It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reflecting on Jesus coming in the likeness of sinful flesh should lead us to ask ourselves some important questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does knowing that Jesus came in the likeness of sinful flesh impact your understanding of His sacrifice?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What does it mean for you personally that Jesus became your substitute?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does this truth inspire you to live differently and follow Christ more closely?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we ponder these questions, let us remember the immense love and grace displayed through Jesus' willingness to take on human flesh, suffer, and die for our sins. May it deepen our gratitude and compel us to live lives that honor Him.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Jesus Christ/The Nature of Jesus/Humanity"></category><category term="christianity"></category></entry></feed>

&lt;p&gt;Scientific consensus is &lt;a href="/discover-the-true-meaning-of-being-a-christian-essential-guide-for-believers"&gt;an important aspect&lt;/a&gt; of the scientific community, providing a foundation for understanding and advancing our knowledge. However, as Christians, we must also recognize that challenging scientific consensus can be legitimate in certain situations. In this article, we will explore the topic of challenging scientific consensus from a staunchly conservative, biblical perspective. We will address key questions and provide thorough, biblically-grounded answers to help Christians navigate &lt;a href="/reconciling-bible-and-science"&gt;this complex issue&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1. Is It Legitimate to Challenge Scientific Consensus?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Christians, we believe in the pursuit of truth and the importance of evidence-based thinking. While scientific consensus should not be dismissed lightly, it is legitimate to challenge it when certain conditions are met. These conditions include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Biblical Consistency&lt;/strong&gt;: If scientific consensus conflicts with biblical teachings or principles, it is legitimate to question and challenge it. As believers in God's Word, we must prioritize biblical truth over any human consensus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Objective Evidence&lt;/strong&gt;: When new evidence emerges that undermines the existing scientific consensus, it is legitimate to challenge it. Science is a continually evolving field, and new discoveries can shed light on previously held beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Motivations&lt;/strong&gt;: If the consensus is influenced by financial or ideological motivations rather than objective analysis of evidence, challenging it becomes necessary. Christians should be discerning and skeptical of any consensus driven by ulterior motives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2. How Can Christian Scientists Challenge Consensus?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christian scientists who find themselves at odds with prevailing scientific consensus face unique challenges. However, there are ways they can navigate this situation while remaining faithful to their beliefs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rigorous Research&lt;/strong&gt;: Engage in rigorous research and experimentation to gather robust evidence that supports alternative viewpoints. This research should adhere to high scientific standards and be subject to peer review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Faith-Based Peer Review Alternatives&lt;/strong&gt;: Seek out faith-based peer review alternatives that provide a platform for evaluating research from a biblical perspective. These platforms can offer valuable insights and critiques that align with Christian beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Biblically Consistent Scientific Theories&lt;/strong&gt;: Develop scientific theories that are consistent with biblical teachings. By integrating faith and science, Christian scientists can contribute to the advancement of knowledge while upholding their convictions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3. How Does Questioning the Materialist Science Paradigm Align with Christianity?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The materialist science paradigm, which asserts that only physical matter and natural processes exist, is incompatible with Christianity. As believers, we affirm the existence of a supernatural realm and acknowledge God as the Creator of all things. Questioning this paradigm is not only legitimate but also necessary for maintaining a biblical worldview. Christians should uphold the belief that there is more to reality than what can be observed through empirical methods alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;4. Can Christian Scientists Spark a Scientific Revolution?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christian scientists have the potential to spark a scientific revolution by challenging prevailing scientific consensus. Throughout history, individuals who dared to question accepted views have brought about significant advancements in scientific understanding. By offering alternative perspectives rooted in biblical truth and conducting rigorous research, Christian scientists can contribute to the growth of knowledge and bring about positive change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;5. How Should Christians Evaluate Scientific Consensus?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Christians, we should evaluate scientific consensus through the lens of Scripture and discernment. Here are some principles to consider:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Biblical Alignment&lt;/strong&gt;: Assess whether the consensus aligns with biblical teachings. If it contradicts Scripture, it cannot be accepted as absolute truth.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dCXWRCKExt8" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Motivations&lt;/strong&gt;: Investigate the motivations behind the consensus. Be cautious if financial or ideological interests influence the consensus, as they may compromise objectivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quality of Evidence&lt;/strong&gt;: Scrutinize the quality and robustness of the evidence supporting the consensus. Evaluate whether it is based on rigorous scientific research or anecdotal evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;6. What Are the Dangers of Blindly Accepting Scientific Consensus?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blindly accepting scientific consensus without critical evaluation can lead to dangers and pitfalls for Christians. Some of these dangers include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Compromising Biblical Truth&lt;/strong&gt;: Accepting a consensus that contradicts biblical teachings can lead to a dilution of faith and compromise in Christian beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Idolizing Science&lt;/strong&gt;: Placing undue trust in scientific consensus can lead to idolizing science, elevating it above God's Word and ultimately undermining one's faith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Neglecting Ethical Considerations&lt;/strong&gt;: Blindly following scientific consensus may result in neglecting ethical considerations. As Christians, we must evaluate scientific findings in light of moral principles derived from Scripture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;7. How Can Christians Engage in Scientific Discourse?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christians should engage in scientific discourse with humility, respect, and a commitment to truth. Here are some ways to effectively participate:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Informed Engagement&lt;/strong&gt;: Stay informed about the latest research and developments in relevant scientific fields to contribute to discussions from an informed perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Faithful Witness&lt;/strong&gt;: Be a faithful witness by demonstrating integrity, displaying Christ-like character, and reflecting biblical values in scientific conversations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prayerful Discernment&lt;/strong&gt;: Seek guidance through prayer and rely on &lt;a href="/how-to-study-the-bible"&gt;the Holy Spirit&lt;/a&gt; for wisdom and discernment when engaging in scientific discourse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;8. How Can Christians Navigate Tensions Between Faith and Science?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tensions between faith and science are inevitable, but Christians can navigate them with grace and wisdom. Here are some key principles:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unity of Truth&lt;/strong&gt;: Recognize that truth cannot contradict truth. Faith and science, when rightly understood, should complement each other rather than conflict.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Humility&lt;/strong&gt;: Embrace humility by acknowledging the limitations of human understanding and recognizing that both faith and science have their respective domains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Integration&lt;/strong&gt;: Seek integration by exploring the ways in which faith and science can inform and enrich each other. Embrace scientific discoveries that align with biblical principles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, challenging scientific consensus can be legitimate for Christians when it conflicts with biblical teachings, is based on flawed evidence or motivations, or when new evidence emerges. Through rigorous research, engagement in scientific discourse, and integration of faith and science, Christians can contribute to the advancement of knowledge while remaining faithful to their beliefs. As believers, we must prioritize biblical truth and discernment in evaluating scientific consensus, recognizing that &lt;a href="/parental-rights"&gt;our ultimate authority&lt;/a&gt; is God's Word.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Science and Faith/Christian Scientific Resistance"></category><category term="Christian scientists against consensus"></category><category term="Faith-based peer review alternatives"></category><category term="Biblically consistent scientific theories"></category><category term="Questioning materialist science paradigm"></category><category term="Christian scientific revolution UK"></category></entry><entry><title>7 Transformative Alternative Research Methodologies for Christian Scholars</title><link href="https://biblebasedliving.com/alternative-research-methodologies/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-04-24T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-04-24T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>maisha_johnson</name></author><id>tag:biblebasedliving.com,2024-04-24:/alternative-research-methodologies/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Alternative Research Methodologies: A Biblical Perspective&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the field of research, various methodologies are employed to investigate and understand different phenomena. While traditional approaches such as surveys and interviews are widely used, alternative research methodologies offer unique perspectives and insights. As Christians, our approach to research should be guided by biblical principles and aligned with our faith. In this article, we will explore alternative research methodologies from a staunchly conservative, biblical perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1. What is the biblical scientific method?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biblical scientific method is rooted in the belief that God is &lt;a href="/teacher-training"&gt;the ultimate source&lt;/a&gt; of truth and knowledge. It recognizes that God has revealed Himself through His creation and His Word, the Bible. As Christians, we approach scientific inquiry with the understanding that all truth is God's truth, and that scientific discoveries can help us better understand God's creation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One key aspect of the biblical scientific method is the recognition that empirical evidence is valuable in understanding &lt;a href="/reconciling-bible-and-science"&gt;the natural world&lt;/a&gt;. While faith is essential in our relationship with God, it does not mean that we disregard empirical evidence or neglect scientific research. Instead, we approach empirical evidence with humility, recognizing that our understanding is limited and subject to refinement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Biblical Support:&lt;/strong&gt;
- &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/19/Psalm-19-1.html"&gt;Psalm 19:1&lt;/a&gt; says, "The heavens declare the glory of God; the skies proclaim the work of his hands."
- &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Proverbs/25/Proverbs-25-2.html"&gt;Proverbs 25:2&lt;/a&gt; states, "It is the glory of God to conceal a matter; to search out a matter is the glory of kings."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Source Material: "Decolonizing Methodologies in Qualitative Research: Creating Spaces for..."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2. How do faith-based research protocols differ from secular ones?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Faith-based research protocols differ from secular ones in that they are guided by a Christian worldview and seek to align with biblical values and principles. While secular research often seeks to explore phenomena without considering spiritual dimensions, faith-based research acknowledges the role of faith and spirituality in shaping human experiences and behaviors. It recognizes that spiritual beliefs and practices can have a significant impact on individuals and communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Faith-based research protocols also prioritize ethical considerations, recognizing &lt;a href="/genetic-evidence-challenges"&gt;the inherent worth&lt;/a&gt; and dignity of every individual as created in the image of God. This means that researchers should seek informed consent, protect privacy and confidentiality, and ensure that participants are treated with respect and dignity throughout the research process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Biblical Support:&lt;/strong&gt;
- &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Proverbs/2/Proverbs-2-6.html"&gt;Proverbs 2:6&lt;/a&gt; says, "For the Lord gives wisdom; from his mouth come knowledge and understanding."
- &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Colossians/3/Colossians-3-23.html"&gt;Colossians 3:23&lt;/a&gt; reminds us, "Whatever you do, work at it with &lt;a href="/powerful-prayer-for-christian-new-beginnings-find-hope-and-renewal"&gt;all your heart&lt;/a&gt;, as working for the Lord, not for human masters."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;3. How can a Christian approach incorporate empirical evidence into research?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Christians, we believe that God has revealed Himself both through His Word and through His creation. Therefore, our approach to incorporating empirical evidence into research should be guided by Scripture. We recognize that empirical evidence can help us better understand God's creation and gain insights into the natural world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Christian approach to incorporating empirical evidence involves recognizing its limitations and subjecting it to biblical scrutiny. We understand that empirical evidence is not infallible, as it is subject to human error and interpretation. Therefore, we should approach empirical findings with humility and discernment, aligning them with biblical principles and teachings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Biblical Support:&lt;/strong&gt;
- &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Proverbs/3/Proverbs-3-5.html"&gt;Proverbs 3:5-6&lt;/a&gt; encourages us to trust in the Lord with all our hearts and lean not on &lt;a href="/5-powerful-prayers-for-trust-in-god-strengthen-your-faith-today"&gt;our own understanding&lt;/a&gt;.
- &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-Thessalonians/5/1-Thessalonians-5-21.html"&gt;1 Thessalonians 5:21&lt;/a&gt; instructs us to "test everything; hold fast what is good."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scientific freedom advocacy is a topic of increasing significance in today's world. As Christians, we are called to engage with this issue from a staunchly conservative, biblical perspective. In this article, we will explore &lt;a href="/divine-design-in-nature"&gt;eight key questions&lt;/a&gt; related to scientific freedom advocacy and provide thorough, biblically-grounded answers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Question 1: What is scientific freedom advocacy?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientific freedom advocacy is the promotion and defense of the fundamental rights of scientists to pursue their research and express their findings without fear of censorship or discrimination. It encompasses the protection of academic freedom, ensuring that scientists can explore all areas of inquiry without undue pressure or limitations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Biblical Foundation:&lt;/em&gt; The Bible affirms the value of knowledge and understanding. &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Proverbs/9/Proverbs-9-10.html"&gt;Proverbs 9:10&lt;/a&gt; tells us that "The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom, and knowledge of the Holy One is understanding." God desires for His people to seek knowledge and understanding within the boundaries of His truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Question 2: How does religious discrimination affect scientific careers?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Religious discrimination can have a detrimental impact on scientific careers. Christian scientists may face prejudice or bias in academic institutions or professional settings due to their faith. This can result in limited opportunities for advancement, exclusion from research projects, or even outright dismissal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Biblical Foundation:&lt;/em&gt; The Bible teaches us that all individuals are created in the image of God (&lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/1/Genesis-1-27.html"&gt;Genesis 1:27&lt;/a&gt;). Discrimination based on religious beliefs goes against the biblical principle of treating others with love and respect. &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Galatians/3/Galatians-3-28.html"&gt;Galatians 3:28&lt;/a&gt; reminds us that "There is neither Jew nor Gentile, neither slave nor free, nor is there male and female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus." We are called to value and honor one another regardless of our differences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Question 3: What are faith-based scientific publication rights?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Faith-based scientific publication rights involve ensuring that researchers who hold religious beliefs are not discriminated against when seeking to publish their work. It is essential that &lt;a href="/evolutionary-theory-flaws"&gt;the scientific community&lt;/a&gt; recognizes and respects diverse perspectives, including those informed by faith, to foster a climate of true intellectual openness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Biblical Foundation:&lt;/em&gt; The Bible encourages us to seek truth and understanding while upholding our faith. &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/19/Psalm-19-1.html"&gt;Psalm 19:1&lt;/a&gt; declares, "The heavens declare the glory of God; the skies proclaim the work of his hands." As Christians, we believe that all truth ultimately finds its source in God. Therefore, recognizing and respecting faith-based scientific publication rights aligns with the biblical principle of seeking truth in all areas of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Question 4: How can we protect creationist researchers in the UK?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Protecting creationist researchers in the UK involves ensuring that they are not discriminated against or marginalized due to their belief in a literal interpretation of Genesis and God's role in creation. It is crucial to safeguard their academic freedom and provide an environment where their research is respected and given fair consideration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Biblical Foundation:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="/teacher-training"&gt;The biblical account&lt;/a&gt; of creation in Genesis provides a foundation for the belief in a young earth and a specific order of creation. Christians who hold this view should be able to pursue research within this framework without facing discrimination. &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/1/Romans-1-20.html"&gt;Romans 1:20&lt;/a&gt; reminds us that "For since the creation of the world God's invisible qualitiesâ€”his eternal power and divine natureâ€”have been clearly seen, being understood from what has been made." Protecting creationist researchers allows for a robust exploration of scientific evidence that aligns with their biblical beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Question 5: What are Christian science anti-discrimination laws?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christian science anti-discrimination laws aim to protect individuals from discrimination based on &lt;a href="/legal-challenges"&gt;their religious beliefs&lt;/a&gt; within the scientific community. These laws ensure that Christian scientists are not excluded from research opportunities, funding, or academic positions due to their faith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Biblical Foundation:&lt;/em&gt; The Bible teaches us that we should not be discriminated against or treated unfairly because of our beliefs. In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/7/Matthew-7-12.html"&gt;Matthew 7:12&lt;/a&gt;, Jesus instructs us to "do to others what you would have them do to you." Christian science anti-discrimination laws reflect this biblical principle by advocating for fair treatment and equal opportunities for all scientists, regardless of their religious convictions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Question 6: How do we reconcile scientific freedom with biblical truth?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientific freedom and biblical truth are not inherently in conflict. While scientific inquiry seeks to understand &lt;a href="/alternative-research-methodologies"&gt;the natural world&lt;/a&gt;, it is important to interpret scientific findings within the framework of biblical truth. Scripture provides the ultimate authority and lens through which scientific discoveries should be understood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Biblical Foundation:&lt;/em&gt; The Bible affirms that God is the author of both creation and His Word. As Christians, we believe that God's revelation in Scripture is infallible and serves as the ultimate guide for understanding truth. &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Proverbs/3/Proverbs-3-5.html"&gt;Proverbs 3:5-6&lt;/a&gt; reminds us to "Trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding; in &lt;a href="/devotional-resources"&gt;all your ways&lt;/a&gt; submit to him, and he will make your paths straight." By submitting our scientific endeavors to the authority of God's Word, we can reconcile scientific inquiry with biblical truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Question 7: How can Christians advocate for scientific freedom while adhering to biblical principles?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christians can advocate for scientific freedom while adhering to biblical principles by advocating for intellectual openness and respecting diverse perspectives within appropriate boundaries. This involves promoting academic freedom, protecting researchers' rights to pursue their inquiries, and engaging in respectful dialogue that upholds biblical values.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Biblical Foundation:&lt;/em&gt; The Bible encourages us to engage with others in a spirit of love, respect, and humility. &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Colossians/4/Colossians-4-6.html"&gt;Colossians 4:6&lt;/a&gt; exhorts us to "Let your conversation be always full of grace, seasoned with salt." By embodying these qualities while advocating for scientific freedom, Christians can be effective ambassadors for both intellectual rigor and biblical truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Question 8: How can Christians address secular ideologies that may hinder scientific freedom?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christians can address secular ideologies that hinder scientific freedom by engaging in thoughtful dialogue, presenting biblical perspectives, and highlighting the limitations and potential biases of secular worldviews. It is essential to approach these discussions with love, humility, and a commitment to truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Biblical Foundation:&lt;/em&gt; The Bible instructs us to be discerning and test all ideas against the standard of God's Word. In &lt;a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-Thessalonians/5/1-Thessalonians-5-21.html"&gt;1 Thessalonians 5:21&lt;/a&gt;, we are told to "test everything; hold fast what is good." By critically evaluating secular ideologies in light of biblical truth, Christians can effectively engage in conversations that promote scientific freedom while upholding the supremacy of Scripture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, as Christians, we are called to advocate for scientific freedom while remaining firmly grounded in biblical truth. By upholding the principles of academic freedom, respecting diverse perspectives, and engaging in respectful dialogue, we can contribute to a climate that fosters intellectual rigor and honors God's truth. Let us embrace our role as stewards of knowledge and seek to integrate our faith with scientific inquiry for the glory of God and the benefit of humanity.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Science and Faith/Christian Scientific Resistance"></category><category term="Christian scientists academic freedom"></category><category term="Religious discrimination science careers"></category><category term="Faith-based scientific publication rights"></category><category term="Protecting creationist researchers UK"></category><category term="Christian science anti-discrimination laws"></category></entry></feed>

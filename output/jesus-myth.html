in the New Testament are merely myths borrowed from pagan folklore. Some argue that the stories of Osiris, Dionysus, Adonis, Attis, and Mithras are essentially the same as the narrative of Jesus Christ. However, upon closer examination, these claims are found to be unfounded and lacking in historical accuracy. In this article, we will delve into the history behind these assertions, examine the portrayals of false gods compared to Christ, expose logical fallacies, and explore why the New Testament Gospels are trustworthy depictions of the true and historical Jesus Christ.<h3>The Origins of the Jesus Myth</h3><p>The claim that Jesus was a myth or exaggeration originated with liberal German theologians in the nineteenth century. They argued that Jesus was nothing more than a copy of popular dying-and-rising fertility gods in various cultures. However, it is important to note that these theories were not taken seriously by contemporary scholars. Only recently have these assertions resurfaced with the rise of misinformation on the internet.<h3>Comparing Jesus to Mythological Gods</h3><p>One commonly cited comparison is between Jesus and the Egyptian god Horus. It is claimed that Horus shares many similarities with Jesus, such as being born on December 25 of a virgin, having a star in the East proclaiming his arrival, and being crucified and resurrected after three days. However, when we examine the actual writings about Horus, we find that these claims are greatly exaggerated or entirely baseless.<p>Another comparison is made between Jesus and Mithras. Again, it is alleged that Mithras shares similarities with Jesus, such as being born of a virgin and rising from the dead after three days. However, a closer look at the Mithras myth reveals that these claims are not accurate.<p>When comparing Jesus to mythological gods like Horus and Mithras, it becomes clear that there are significant differences and little resemblance between them. The historical Jesus depicted in the Bible stands alone as a unique figure.</p><iframe allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen frameborder=0 height=315 src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/5Xil20H9yPE width=560></iframe><h3>Logical Fallacies in the Jesus Myth Theory</h3><p>There are two common logical fallacies committed by those claiming that Christianity borrowed from pagan mystery religions: the fallacy of false cause and the terminological fallacy.<p>The fallacy of false cause occurs when something is assumed to be the cause of another thing simply because it precedes it. Even if pre-Christian accounts of mythological gods closely resembled Christ, it does not mean they caused the Gospel writers to invent a false Jesus. Making such a claim is akin to saying that a TV series caused the NASA Space Shuttle program.<p>The terminological fallacy involves redefining words to prove a point. For example, the term "ministry" is redefined when comparing Jesus to Horus or Mithras. While Jesus had a significant ministry teaching and performing miracles, Horus and Mithras did not have comparable ministries. By using the same term, "ministry," to describe both, advocates of the mythological Jesus seek to create a false connection.<h3>The Truthfulness of the New Testament</h3><p>The New Testament stands as a historically verifiable document with more evidence supporting its accuracy than any other work of antiquity. It has multiple writers who were eyewitnesses to the events they recorded, with some writings dating back as early as A.D. 50. Additionally, these writers affirmed their testimonies even unto death.<p>Contrary to claims that Jesus was mistaken for other gods, the New Testament itself attests to the fact that Jesus was not confused with any other deity. When the apostle Paul preached about Jesus rising from the dead in Athens, his message was considered new and strange by the elite thinkers of that city. If dying-and-rising gods were prevalent at that time, they would have likely drawn a connection, but they did not.<h3>Why This Matters</h3><p>The claim that Jesus is a copy of mythological gods is often used to discredit the uniqueness and divinity of Jesus Christ. However, upon closer examination, these claims are found to be lacking in historical accuracy and logical consistency. Understanding the true nature of Jesus is crucial for Christians as it confirms the reality of God's redemptive plan and the significance of Jesus' sacrifice.<h3>Think About It</h3><p>Consider the significance of the New Testament's historical veracity. The early Christian writers were willing to die for their belief in the risen Jesus. If they were perpetuating a lie, why would they choose death over renouncing it? Reflecting on this can deepen our understanding of the authenticity and impact of Jesus' life, death, and resurrection.<p>In conclusion, the claim that Jesus is a copy of mythological gods is based on unfounded assertions, logical fallacies, and selective interpretations. The historical Jesus portrayed in the Bible stands alone as a unique figure. By examining the evidence and critically evaluating these claims, we can confidently affirm the truthfulness and uniqueness of Jesus Christ.</section><div class=author-info><img alt="Maisha Johnson" class=author-image loading=lazy src=https://biblebasedliving.com/images/profile.png><div class=author-details><h4>Maisha Johnson</h4><p>Written by Maisha Johnson, a dedicated Christian writer known for her inspiring narratives and deep spiritual insights.

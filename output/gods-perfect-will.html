specific guidance from Him. We want to know where to work, where to live, whom to marry, and even what car to buy. However, God reveals a different approach to determining His perfect will. While He does have specific plans for each person, His perfect will is the same for all. It includes His desire for everyone to be saved and come to a knowledge of the truth (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/1-Timothy/2/1-Timothy-2-3.html>1 Timothy 2:3</a>–4). It also involves living a sanctified life, avoiding sexual immorality, learning self-control, and doing good as a result of our faith (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/1-Thessalonians/4/1-Thessalonians-4-3.html>1 Thessalonians 4:3</a>–5; <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/1-Peter/2/1-Peter-2-15.html>1 Peter 2:15</a>–16). Additionally, giving thanks in all circumstances is part of God's perfect will for us (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/1-Thessalonians/5/1-Thessalonians-5-18.html>1 Thessalonians 5:18</a>).<h3>Confession and Seeking Forgiveness</h3><p>To align ourselves with God's perfect will, we must start by confessing any known sins. We can trust that God is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/1-John/1/1-John-1-9.html>1 John 1:9</a>). Additionally, we should ask God to search our hearts and reveal any offensive ways within us (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/139/Psalm-139-23.html>Psalm 139:23</a>–24). This introspection helps us identify areas where we may have strayed from God's will and need His forgiveness.<h3>Seeking Forgiveness and Restitution</h3><p>If our actions involved sinning against someone else, it is crucial that we seek their forgiveness and make amends. Zacchaeus is an example of repentance and restitution when he promised to repay four times the amount he cheated from others (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/19/Luke-19-8.html>Luke 19:8</a>). This act of seeking forgiveness and making restitution demonstrates a "fruit in keeping with repentance" as preached by John the Baptist (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/3/Luke-3-9.html>Luke 3:9</a>).<h3>Glorifying God in All We Do</h3><p>Returning to the Lord and seeking to glorify Him is an essential aspect of living in alignment with His perfect will. In everything we do, whether in work or daily life, we should strive to bring glory to God (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/1-Corinthians/10/1-Corinthians-10-31.html>1 Corinthians 10:31</a>). By making God the center of our actions and decisions, we can ensure that we are living according to His perfect will.<h3>Relying on the Holy Spirit's Guidance</h3><p>We cannot live out God's perfect will in our own strength. We must rely on the power of the Holy Spirit who dwells within us. Jesus promised that the Holy Spirit would be our guide and teacher (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/John/14/John-14-26.html>John 14:26</a>; 16:13). With the Spirit's guidance, we can discern God's will and walk in obedience.<p>Understanding that God's perfect will is not solely about specific decisions, such as what car to buy or where to go for lunch, is crucial. While these choices are important, they do not determine whether we are in alignment with God's perfect will. The book of Proverbs reminds us that although we can make plans, it is ultimately the Lord who directs our steps (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Proverbs/16/Proverbs-16-1.html>Proverbs 16:1</a>–9). Seeking the Lord, committing our ways to Him, and trusting in His sovereignty allows us to make decisions with humility and obedience.</p><iframe allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen frameborder=0 height=315 src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/uY8VwyNBM9s width=560></iframe><h3>Missing God's Perfect Will</h3><p>While God's perfect will is unchanging and available to all believers, it is possible to miss out on experiencing His best for us due to sinful or unwise decisions. When we make choices that go against God's principles, there may be consequences that affect our lives. Examples from Scripture illustrate how individuals missed God's best due to disobedience.<p>King Jehoash only partially obeyed God's command and missed out on complete victory over his enemies (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/2-Kings/13/2-Kings-13-18.html>2 Kings 13:18</a>–19). Moses struck the rock instead of speaking to it as God commanded, and as a result, he was not allowed to enter the Promised Land (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Numbers/20/Numbers-20-10.html>Numbers 20:10</a>–13). King Jehoshaphat allied himself with a wicked king and suffered the loss of his fleet (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/2-Chronicles/20/2-Chronicles-20-35.html>2 Chronicles 20:35</a>–37).<p>When we find ourselves in a position where we have missed God's perfect will, we should trust in His forgiveness and do the next right thing. The Bible assures us that even in our failures, "all things work together for good to those who love God, to those who are called according to His purpose" (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/8/Romans-8-28.html>Romans 8:28</a>). We can still be forgiven and continue to follow the truth, living in obedience to God's will.<h3>Why This Matters</h3><p>Understanding God's perfect will helps us navigate life's decisions with clarity and confidence. It reminds us that our ultimate purpose is to glorify God and live in alignment with His principles. By seeking forgiveness, making amends, and relying on the Holy Spirit's guidance, we can continually move closer to God's perfect will for our lives.<h3>Think About It</h3><ol><li>Do you believe that God has a specific plan for your life? How does knowing His desire for all people to be saved and live a sanctified life impact your understanding of His will?<li>Have you experienced the consequences of making ungodly or unwise decisions? How did it affect your perception of being in alignment with God's perfect will?<li>Reflect on how you can more intentionally seek God's will in your daily life. Consider implementing practices such as confession, seeking forgiveness, and relying on the Holy Spirit's guidance.</ol></section><div class=author-info><img alt="Maisha Johnson" class=author-image loading=lazy src=https://biblebasedliving.com/images/profile.png><div class=author-details><h4>Maisha Johnson</h4><p>Written by Maisha Johnson, a dedicated Christian writer known for her inspiring narratives and deep spiritual insights.

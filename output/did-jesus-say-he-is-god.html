While those exact words may not be found in the Bible, Jesus did make various claims and statements that clearly conveyed His divinity. In this article, we will explore several instances where Jesus indicated His divine nature and examine the reactions of those who heard Him. Through His words, actions, miracles, and resurrection, Jesus demonstrated His identity as the Son of God.<h3>Jesus and the Father are One</h3><p>In <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/John/10/John-10-30.html>John 10:30</a>, Jesus proclaimed, "I and the Father are one." Although He did not explicitly say, "I am God," this statement left no doubt about His divinity. The Jews who heard Him were well aware of the implications of such a claim and immediately picked up stones to stone Him for blasphemy (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/John/10/John-10-31.html>John 10:31</a>). Their reaction clearly indicates that they understood Jesus to be equating Himself with God.<p><strong>Why This Matters</strong> Understanding Jesus' claim to be one with the Father is crucial because it reveals His divine nature. It challenges us to acknowledge that Jesus is not just a mere man but God in human form.<p><strong>Think About It</strong> Imagine someone today claiming to be one with God. How would people react? How would you respond?<h3>Before Abraham Was, I Am</h3><p>In <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/John/8/John-8-58.html>John 8:58</a>, Jesus made another significant statement affirming His deity. He said, "Very truly I tell you... before Abraham was born, I am!" By using the phrase "I am," Jesus intentionally echoed the name of God revealed to Moses in <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Exodus/3/Exodus-3-14.html>Exodus 3:14</a>. The Jews listening to Him understood that He was claiming preexistence and equating Himself with Yahweh.<p><strong>Why This Matters</strong> Jesus' use of "I am" reveals His eternal nature and further establishes His claim to be God. It demonstrates that He existed before Abraham and has divine authority.<p><strong>Think About It</strong> Why do you think Jesus chose to use the phrase "I am" to describe Himself? What does this say about His relationship with God?<h3>The Word Became Flesh</h3><p>The Gospel of John begins with a profound statement affirming Jesus' deity: "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God" (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/John/1/John-1-1.html>John 1:1</a>). Here, John identifies Jesus as the Word who became flesh and dwelt among us (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/John/1/John-1-14.html>John 1:14</a>). This passage emphasizes that Jesus is both fully God and fully human.<p><strong>Why This Matters</strong> Recognizing Jesus as the Word made flesh helps us understand that He is not just a great teacher or prophet but God Himself, who took on human form to reveal God's glory.</p><iframe allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen frameborder=0 height=315 src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/zylfRYiBSr4 width=560></iframe><p><strong>Think About It</strong> How does the concept of Jesus being the Word made flesh impact your understanding of His divinity? How does it affect your relationship with Him?<h3>Thomas' Confession</h3><p>After His resurrection, Jesus appeared to His disciples, including Thomas. When Thomas saw Jesus, he exclaimed, "My Lord and my God!" (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/John/20/John-20-28.html>John 20:28</a>). Rather than correcting Thomas for his declaration, Jesus accepted it. This interaction affirms Jesus' divinity and acknowledges that He is worthy of worship.<p><strong>Why This Matters</strong> Thomas' confession highlights the importance of recognizing Jesus as both Lord and God. It challenges us to acknowledge Jesus' rightful place in our lives and worship Him as our Savior.<p><strong>Think About It</strong> How does Thomas' confession impact your own understanding of who Jesus is? How does it shape your devotion to Him?<h3>Worshiping Jesus</h3><p>Throughout His ministry, Jesus received worship from His disciples. For example, when He walked on water, His disciples worshiped Him (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/14/Matthew-14-33.html>Matthew 14:33</a>). After His resurrection, they fell at His feet and worshiped Him (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/28/Matthew-28-9.html>Matthew 28:9</a>). Jesus never rebuked them for worshiping Him but instead accepted their worship as good and proper.<p><strong>Why This Matters</strong> The disciples' worship of Jesus demonstrates their recognition of His divinity. It teaches us that worshiping Jesus is not only acceptable but also essential to our faith.<p><strong>Think About It</strong> How does the disciples' worship of Jesus inspire your own worship? How does it deepen your understanding of His divinity?<h3>The Testimony of Paul and John</h3><p>The New Testament, through the writings of Paul and John, further affirms Jesus' deity. Paul eagerly awaited the appearing of "our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ" (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Titus/2/Titus-2-13.html>Titus 2:13</a>). Both Paul and John declare that Jesus is the Creator of the universe (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/John/1/John-1-3.html>John 1:3</a>; <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Colossians/1/Colossians-1-16.html>Colossians 1:16</a>–17). These passages reinforce the understanding that Jesus is God.<p><strong>Why This Matters</strong> The testimony of Paul and John strengthens our confidence in Jesus' divine nature. It confirms that the early Christians recognized and proclaimed Jesus as God.<p><strong>Think About It</strong> How does the testimony of Paul and John enhance your understanding of who Jesus is? How does it impact your faith in Him?<h3>Conclusion</h3><p>While Jesus did not explicitly say, "I am God," He made numerous claims and statements that unmistakably revealed His divine nature. Through His words, actions, miracles, and resurrection, Jesus demonstrated that He is the Son of God. Understanding and accepting Jesus as God is a foundational aspect of the Christian faith. It challenges us to recognize His authority, worship Him, and place our trust in Him as our Savior and Lord.<p>As we reflect on these truths, may we grow in our understanding of who Jesus is and deepen our relationship with Him.</section><div class=author-info><img alt="Maisha Johnson" class=author-image loading=lazy src=https://biblebasedliving.com/images/profile.png><div class=author-details><h4>Maisha Johnson</h4><p>Written by Maisha Johnson, a dedicated Christian writer known for her inspiring narratives and deep spiritual insights.

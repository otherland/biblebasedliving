His earthly father, Joseph, was also a carpenter, and it is likely that Jesus learned the trade from him. It may seem peculiar to think that God Incarnate would be taught by a human man, but Jesus humbled himself in every aspect of His earthly life (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Philippians/2/Philippians-2-6.html>Philippians 2:6</a>–8).<p>People referred to Jesus as a carpenter (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/6/Mark-6-3.html>Mark 6:3</a>), and He was known as the carpenter's son (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/13/Matthew-13-55.html>Matthew 13:55</a>). The Greek word used for "carpenter" in these passages, "tekton," can also be translated more broadly as "artisan," "contractor," or "handyman." This suggests that Jesus and Joseph were skilled in various forms of craftsmanship and were called upon when something needed to be fixed, whether it was made of wood, stone, or another material.</p><iframe allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen frameborder=0 height=315 src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/a0YHhdfwyY0 width=560></iframe><p>It is even possible that they acted as civil engineers, designing structures such as bridges or other buildings needed by the people of their town. This sheds an interesting light on Jesus' later comments about the temple. As they passed by the temple, His disciples pointed out the grandeur of the great buildings. Jesus responded by prophesying that these structures would be destroyed (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/13/Mark-13-2.html>Mark 13:2</a>). Beyond being a prophecy, His words were a reminder of the importance of prioritizing the spiritual over the physical.<p>Jesus also made a prophecy about the temple, stating that the Jews would destroy it and He would raise it up again in three days. In reality, He was referring to His resurrection (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/John/2/John-2-19.html>John 2:19</a>–21). When His disciples reflected on this statement after His death and resurrection, they came to believe in Him (verse 22). The night of His arrest, Jesus told His disciples about a future building project: "I go and prepare a place for you" (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/John/14/John-14-3.html>John 14:3</a>). This demonstrates that the Son of God and the Carpenter of Nazareth is currently building His church (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/16/Matthew-16-18.html>Matthew 16:18</a>) and preparing an eternal dwelling place for all who trust in Him.<h3>Why This Matters</h3><p>Understanding Jesus' occupation as a carpenter is significant because it reveals His humility and willingness to identify with humanity. By working as a carpenter, Jesus embraced a common profession and experienced the toils and challenges that came with it. This enables us to relate to Him on a deeper level, knowing that He understands the difficulties we face in our daily lives.<p>Additionally, Jesus' work as a carpenter highlights the importance of valuing the spiritual over the physical. Despite being skilled in constructing physical structures, Jesus emphasized the eternal nature of His kingdom and the importance of building up the spiritual temple of His church. This serves as a reminder for us to prioritize our relationship with God and invest in things that have lasting value.<h3>Think About It</h3><ol><li>Imagine what it would have been like for Jesus, who created the universe, to be taught by Joseph, an earthly carpenter. How does this demonstrate Jesus' humility?<li>Consider how Jesus' work as a carpenter shapes your understanding of His ministry. How does His experience as a craftsman inform your perception of Him as the Savior?<li>Reflect on the significance of prioritizing the spiritual over the physical in your own life. In what ways can you invest in things that have lasting value?</ol></section><div class=author-info><img alt="Maisha Johnson" class=author-image loading=lazy src=https://biblebasedliving.com/images/profile.png><div class=author-details><h4>Maisha Johnson</h4><p>Written by Maisha Johnson, a dedicated Christian writer known for her inspiring narratives and deep spiritual insights.

Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. In these accounts, Jesus is anointed by a woman with a costly jar of perfume. Although the specific details vary slightly in each Gospel, the central theme and message remain consistent.<h3>Anointing in Matthew and Mark</h3><p>In Matthew and Mark's accounts, the anointing takes place in the town of Bethany at the home of Simon the leper. A woman approaches Jesus with an alabaster flask of expensive ointment and pours it on His head as He reclines at a table. The disciples react with anger, considering the act to be wasteful extravagance. However, Jesus defends the woman, recognizing her act as a beautiful gesture of love and devotion.<p>Jesus explains that the anointing is preparing His body for burial and that this act of love will be remembered wherever the good news is preached. By emphasizing the prophetic significance of the anointing, Matthew and Mark allude to Jesus' impending death and burial. There may also be an implication of Jesus' kingship, as in the Old Testament, anointing was often associated with the dedication of kings.<h3>Anointing in Luke</h3><p>Luke's account presents a similar, yet different, instance of Jesus being anointed. In this case, Jesus is dining at the home of Simon the Pharisee when a sinful woman approaches Him. She anoints His feet with perfume and lavishes her love and gratitude upon Him. Simon the Pharisee fails to extend customary respect and hospitality to Jesus but remains critical of the woman's actions.<p>Jesus uses this occasion to teach about forgiveness through a parable. He highlights the contrast between Simon's lack of hospitality and the woman's extravagant display of love. This narrative occurs about a year before Jesus' death and offers a lesson on forgiveness and love, rather than focusing solely on Jesus' impending burial.<h3>Anointing in John</h3><p>In John's account, Lazarus' sister Mary is the woman who anoints Jesus with expensive perfume. This event takes place in Bethany, six days before Passover. Judas Iscariot objects to what he considers a waste of resources, as the perfume could have been sold and the money given to the poor. However, Jesus defends Mary, acknowledging her act as a unique opportunity to honor Him.</p><iframe allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen frameborder=0 height=315 src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/4fkBUycu35Y width=560></iframe><p>Mary's anointing points to Jesus' identity as the Messiah-King. It also foreshadows Jesus' humble position as the Servant-King. By anointing Jesus' feet and wiping them with her hair, Mary symbolically demonstrates Jesus' actions at the Last Supper when He washes the disciples' feet. This act of humility and service teaches His disciples about sacrificial love for one another.<h3>Significance of the Anointing</h3><p>The anointing of Jesus by these women represents their recognition of His unequaled value and their gratitude for His work and presence. Each woman's act of pouring out precious and costly perfume is an extravagant act of worship. Although they may not fully comprehend the messianic significance of their actions, their love and devotion surpass that of others present.<p>The anointing events occur in various contexts but share common themes. They highlight Jesus' impending death and burial as well as His identity as the Messiah-King. In each account, Jesus defends the women against criticism, recognizing their acts as expressions of love and devotion.<h2>Why This Matters</h2><p>Understanding the anointing of Jesus provides insights into His mission and purpose. The anointings symbolize His impending death and burial, emphasizing His role as the Savior who would sacrificially give His life for humanity's redemption. The women's acts of love and devotion serve as examples for believers today, encouraging us to express our gratitude and worship wholeheartedly.<h2>Think About It</h2><ul><li>How can we express our love and devotion to Jesus in our daily lives?<li>What can we learn from the women who anointed Jesus about the value of sacrificial acts of worship?<li>In what ways can we demonstrate humility and service to others, following Jesus' example?</ul></section><div class=author-info><img alt="Maisha Johnson" class=author-image loading=lazy src=https://biblebasedliving.com/images/profile.png><div class=author-details><h4>Maisha Johnson</h4><p>Written by Maisha Johnson, a dedicated Christian writer known for her inspiring narratives and deep spiritual insights.

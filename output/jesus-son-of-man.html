This title is used 82 times and was the primary way Jesus referred to Himself. While other titles for Jesus, such as Son of God, emphasize His deity, Son of Man focuses on His humanity. In fact, the phrase "Son of Man" is a term used to describe any human being. However, when applied to Jesus, it carries a significant meaning.<p>Jesus, the Son of Man, is the perfect embodiment of what God intended humanity to be. He is the supreme example of truth and grace. In Him, "all the fullness of the Deity lives in bodily form." (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Colossians/2/Colossians-2-9.html>Colossians 2:9</a>) Jesus' incarnation as the Son of Man showcases His humility and willingness to lower Himself from His heavenly glory to identify with humanity.<p>Throughout His life on Earth, Jesus experienced the limitations and struggles of being human. He was born in a humble manger and lived a life without earthly possessions. Jesus associated with sinners, ate and drank with them, and ultimately suffered at the hands of men. This intentional choice to become the Son of Man demonstrates His deep love for humanity and His desire to save us.<p>One significant moment where Jesus referred to Himself as the Son of Man was during His trial before the high priest. He quoted a prophecy from <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Daniel/7/Daniel-7-13.html>Daniel 7:13-14</a>, which speaks of a figure who comes with the clouds of heaven and receives dominion, glory, and an everlasting kingdom. By applying this prophecy to Himself, Jesus claimed that He is the Son of Man who will rule over all things.</p><iframe allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen frameborder=0 height=315 src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/0SOJEyzdg-M width=560></iframe><h3>The Humanity and Deity of Jesus</h3><p>Jesus is not only fully human but also fully God. He existed eternally as the Second Person of the Trinity before taking on human flesh. The Gospel of John describes Jesus as the Word who was with God and was God from the beginning. (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/John/1/John-1-1.html>John 1:1</a>) And the same Word became flesh and dwelt among us. (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/John/1/John-1-14.html>John 1:14</a>)<p>The combination of Jesus' humanity and deity is a crucial aspect of Christian theology. It allows Him to fulfill the role of our Savior. As fully human, He can sympathize with our weaknesses and understand our struggles. As fully God, He has the power and authority to forgive sins, execute judgment, and offer eternal salvation.<h3>The Role of the Son of Man</h3><p>Jesus, as the Son of Man, came with a specific purpose. He came to save lives, rise from the dead, and execute judgment. Throughout His ministry, Jesus demonstrated His authority over sin, death, and all aspects of creation. He performed miracles, taught with authority, and ultimately sacrificed Himself on the cross to reconcile humanity with God.<p>The Son of Man is also portrayed as the Lord of the Sabbath. Jesus challenged the religious leaders' legalistic understanding of the Sabbath by emphasizing its true purpose: to bring rest and restoration to people's lives. He revealed that He is the ultimate source of rest and salvation.<h3>Why This Matters</h3><p>Understanding Jesus as the Son of Man is crucial for our faith. It reminds us that Jesus willingly humbled Himself to identify with us in every way. He experienced the limitations and challenges of being human while remaining fully God. This truth gives us assurance that we have a Savior who understands our struggles and empathizes with our weaknesses.<p>Recognizing Jesus as the Son of Man also highlights His authority and power. As the one who will execute judgment, He calls us to surrender our lives to Him and follow His teachings. Knowing that Jesus will establish an everlasting kingdom encourages us to live with a sense of hope and anticipation for His return.<h3>Think About It</h3><ol><li>How does understanding Jesus as both fully human and fully God impact your relationship with Him?<li>In what ways can you identify with the struggles and limitations that Jesus experienced as the Son of Man?<li>Reflect on the humility of Jesus in becoming the Son of Man. How can you emulate His humility in your own life?</ol><p>In conclusion, Jesus being referred to as the Son of Man emphasizes His humanity and His supreme example of what God intended mankind to be. Despite being fully God, Jesus willingly took on human flesh to identify with us and save us. Recognizing Jesus as the Son of Man reminds us of His authority, power, and His future role as the ruler of an everlasting kingdom.</section><div class=author-info><img alt="Maisha Johnson" class=author-image loading=lazy src=https://biblebasedliving.com/images/profile.png><div class=author-details><h4>Maisha Johnson</h4><p>Written by Maisha Johnson, a dedicated Christian writer known for her inspiring narratives and deep spiritual insights.

It's important to approach the Bible with an open heart and mind, allowing the Holy Spirit to guide your reading journey.<p>In <strong><a href=https://www.bibleref.com/2-Timothy/3/2-Timothy-3-16.html>2 Timothy 3:16-17</a></strong>, it says, "All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness, so that the servant of God may be thoroughly equipped for <a href=/amazing-grace-lyrics>every good work</a>."

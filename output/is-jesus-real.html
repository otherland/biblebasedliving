Scholars, both Christian and secular, overwhelmingly agree that there was a historical Jesus. The evidence supporting his existence is substantial and comes from various sources. Ancient historians such as Josephus and Tacitus wrote about Jesus, providing historical documentation. Furthermore, the Old Testament predicted the coming of the Messiah, who would be a real person delivering Israel. These prophecies were fulfilled by Jesus.</p><iframe allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen frameborder=0 height=315 src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/5Xwc_E_q3oQ width=560></iframe><p>The New Testament contains numerous references to Jesus Christ as a real person. The earliest gospel was likely written within 10 years of Jesus' death, and Paul's epistles were written approximately 25 years after his death. This is important because it means that there were still eyewitnesses alive who could verify the truth of the gospel accounts. Additionally, there is overwhelming manuscript evidence for the authenticity of the New Testament, with around 25,000 early manuscripts in existence.<p>Outside of the Bible, Jesus is mentioned in other religious texts such as the Quran, as well as in the writings of Judaism, Gnosticism, and Hinduism. Early historians like Tacitus and Flavius Josephus also referred to Jesus. The impact Jesus has had on the world is unparalleled, with the Western dating system being measured from his birth. Countless charitable organizations have been founded in his name, and millions of people can testify to his work in their lives.<h3>Why This Matters</h3><p>Understanding that Jesus is a real historical figure is essential for Christians as it affirms their faith and provides a foundation for belief. It shows that Christianity is not based on a fictional story but on the life and teachings of a real person who made a significant impact on human history. Recognizing Jesus' existence helps believers to have confidence in their relationship with him and to share their faith with others.<h3>Think About It</h3><p>Consider the implications if Jesus did not exist or if he was merely a fictional character. The entire Christian faith would be built on falsehood, and the impact he has had on the world would be based on a lie. It is essential to examine the evidence and consider the historical and religious accounts that attest to Jesus' existence. Ultimately, faith in Jesus as a real person requires trust in the historical records and the testimony of those who have experienced his transformative power.</section><div class=author-info><img alt="Maisha Johnson" class=author-image loading=lazy src=https://biblebasedliving.com/images/profile.png><div class=author-details><h4>Maisha Johnson</h4><p>Written by Maisha Johnson, a dedicated Christian writer known for her inspiring narratives and deep spiritual insights.

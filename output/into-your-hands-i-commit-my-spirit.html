on the cross, a significant event occurred. The sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was torn in two. In this moment, Jesus called out with a loud voice, saying, "Father, into your hands I commit my spirit." These words hold deep meaning and significance. It is important to note that when Jesus spoke these words, He was quoting Scripture. Specifically, He was quoting <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/31/Psalm-31-5.html>Psalm 31:5</a>.<p>Earlier on the cross, Jesus also quoted from <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/22/Psalm-22-1.html>Psalm 22:1</a>. In everything Jesus did and said, He fulfilled the will of God and the word of God. Even in His final moments, Jesus was aware of His mission and pointed those around Him to the fulfillment of prophecy. Psalm 31 is a prayer of David in distress, expressing trust in God. In Luke 23, Jesus echoes this prayer as the Son of David.<p>The words Jesus utters from the cross are not merely didactic; they also reflect His true emotions. Just as David cried out to God in his time of need, Jesus feels an acute and pressing need for help. He turns to the "faithful God," recognizing that only God can provide true aid. Despite all the trouble surrounding Him, Jesus' spirit reaches upward for relief with unwavering confidence in God as His refuge.<p>Jesus prays, "Father, into your hands I commit my spirit," because it is only in the Father's hands that our spirits are truly safe. Jesus had previously taught about the security of believers when He said, "My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all; no one can snatch them out of my Father's hand" (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/John/10/John-10-29.html>John 10:29</a>). Just as we secure our most valuable earthly possessions in a safe or bank vault where we know they will be protected from harm, Jesus shows us that we should commit our spirits into the Father's hands, the safest place of all.<p>When we are saved, we commit our spirits into the Father's hands, trusting Him for our salvation. From then on, our lives are lived in a continuous commitment of our spirits into His hands. We entrust Him with our service to Him, our daily decisions, and all our joys and sorrows. And when the time of our death comes, we can follow Jesus' example and say, "Father, into your hands I commit my spirit."<p>Throughout history, many Christians have found comfort in Psalm 31 and have echoed Jesus' words from the cross at the time of their death. Stephen, the first Christian martyr, prayed a modified version of Jesus' prayer as he was being stoned to death (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Acts/7/Acts-7-59.html>Acts 7:59</a>). Other notable Christians who have said, "Into your hands I commit my spirit," as they left this world include Polycarp, Martin Luther, and Philip Melanchthon.<h3>Why This Matters</h3><p>The phrase "Into your hands I commit my spirit" carries deep significance for Christians. It reminds us of Jesus' ultimate trust in God the Father and serves as a model for us to follow. By committing our spirits into the Father's hands, we acknowledge His sovereignty and place our trust in His faithful care. It is a declaration that we believe in God's power to protect us and guide us through all circumstances.</p><iframe allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen frameborder=0 height=315 src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/84I3aIQZ0Ew width=560></iframe><p>The words Jesus spoke on the cross also remind us of the fulfillment of prophecy. He fulfilled not only the prophecies about the Messiah but also the prayers of David recorded in the Psalms. This demonstrates the unity and continuity of Scripture and reinforces our confidence in its divine inspiration.<h3>Think About It</h3><ol><li><p>Have you ever thought about what it means to commit your spirit into God's hands? Take a moment to reflect on what this act of trust and surrender entails.</p><li><p>In what areas of your life do you find it challenging to fully commit your spirit into God's hands? Ask God for His help and guidance in entrusting those areas to Him.</p><li><p>How can you incorporate the example of Jesus' prayer into your daily life? Consider how committing your spirit into God's hands can impact your decision-making, relationships, and overall outlook on life.</p></ol></section><div class=author-info><img alt="Maisha Johnson" class=author-image loading=lazy src=https://biblebasedliving.com/images/profile.png><div class=author-details><h4>Maisha Johnson</h4><p>Written by Maisha Johnson, a dedicated Christian writer known for her inspiring narratives and deep spiritual insights.

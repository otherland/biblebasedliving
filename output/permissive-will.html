pleasure in. This allowance of certain things, even sinful things, that indirectly accomplish His will is often referred to as God’s permissive will. Let's explore what this means and why it matters.<h3>Key Point 1: God's Perfect Plan and the Entrance of Sin</h3><p>In the beginning, God created a perfect world as part of His perfect plan (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Deuteronomy/32/Deuteronomy-32-4.html>Deuteronomy 32:4</a>). He also created spiritual beings and humans with a will and the ability to make decisions. Everything was "very good" (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/1/Genesis-1-31.html>Genesis 1:31</a>). However, as God's moral creations exercised their free will, they chose disobedience, and sin entered the world. Despite sin not being a part of God's perfect plan, He allowed it to happen as part of His permissive will.<h3>Why This Matters</h3><p>Understanding God's permissive will helps us make sense of the presence of evil and suffering in the world. It shows us that while God permits certain things to happen, including sinful decisions, these do not contradict His sovereignty or His overarching plan.<h3>Think About It</h3><p>Consider the implications of free will. If God had not given humans the freedom to make choices, would we truly have the capacity to love Him genuinely? How does the existence of evil and suffering in the world challenge our understanding of God's goodness?<h3>Key Point 2: God's Omniscience and Sovereignty</h3><p>God is omniscient, meaning He knows everything that has occurred and all that will occur until the end of time (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/46/Isaiah-46-9.html>Isaiah 46:9</a>–10). As a sovereign God, He must permit all events and happenings. He intentionally made humans with the ability to make decisions and placed the tree of the knowledge of good and evil in the garden, knowing Adam and Eve would choose to sin. This falls within God's sovereign will and demonstrates His permissive nature.<h3>Why This Matters</h3><p>Recognizing God's omniscience and sovereignty helps us trust in His plan, even when we don't understand why certain things are allowed to happen. It reminds us that God is in control, even in the face of evil and suffering.<h3>Think About It</h3><p>How does the knowledge of God's omniscience and sovereignty impact your trust in Him? How can you find comfort and peace in knowing that He is in control, even when things seem chaotic?<h3>Key Point 3: Consequences of Not Following God's Preceptive Will</h3><p>God does not force us to carry out His commands (His preceptive will). Instead, in His permissive will, He allows us to make decisions, including sinful ones that are not His best for our lives. However, not following God's preceptive will comes with consequences. An example can be seen in the Israelites' demand for a king in 1 Samuel 8. Although it was not God's will for them, He allowed them to have a king like other nations. However, their decision resulted in negative consequences.<h3>Why This Matters</h3><p>Understanding the consequences of not following God's preceptive will helps us make more informed choices. It reminds us that our decisions have real-life implications and encourages us to seek God's guidance and follow His commands.<h3>Think About It</h3><p>Reflect on a time when you made a decision that went against God's preceptive will. What were the consequences of that decision? How did it shape your understanding of God's guidance and the importance of following His commands?<h3>Key Point 4: Experiencing God's Permissive Will</h3><p>We experience God's permissive will every day through the choices we make. We have the freedom to decide what we eat, how we spend our time, where we work, whom we marry, and much more. Some of our choices have lifelong consequences, while others do not. Additionally, the decisions made by others can affect us negatively, and sometimes we face unpleasant circumstances. It is important to remember that whatever happens is part of God's permissive will.<h3>Why This Matters</h3><p>Recognizing that every choice and circumstance is allowed by God's permissive will helps us navigate life's ups and downs with a sense of trust and faith. It reminds us that God is still in control, even when things don't go according to our plans.<h3>Think About It</h3><p>How does the knowledge of God's permissive will impact your decision-making process? How can you seek His guidance and align your choices with His preceptive will?<h3>Key Point 5: Limits on Evil in God's Permissive Will</h3><iframe allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen frameborder=0 height=315 src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/Dp1YIbMVWPg width=560></iframe><p>In God's permissive will, evil is allowed a certain amount of freedom but within limits. For example, in the story of Job, Satan was allowed to torment him, but God placed strict boundaries on how far Satan could go (see Job 1—2). This shows that even though evil may be permitted for a time, God ultimately controls its reach.<h3>Why This Matters</h3><p>Understanding the limits placed on evil in God's permissive will gives us hope and reassurance. It reminds us that while evil may exist and bring temporary suffering, it cannot overpower God's ultimate plan and purpose.<h3>Think About It</h3><p>Reflect on a time when you experienced the limits of evil in your life. How did God provide protection or bring about good despite the presence of evil? How did this experience strengthen your faith?<h3>Key Point 6: God's Permissive Will and Greater Good</h3><p>In God's permissive will, evil is allowed to function, but His perfect plan always triumphs. A prime example is seen in the life of Joseph. God permitted Joseph to be kidnapped and enslaved by his brothers. At every mistreatment, God had the power to intervene, but He "permitted" the evil and, in that limited sense, willed it to happen. God allowed the sins of Joseph's brothers to bring about a greater good (see <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/50/Genesis-50-20.html>Genesis 50:20</a>).<h3>Why This Matters</h3><p>Understanding that God can use even the darkest moments for His greater purpose gives us hope and comfort. It reminds us that God can redeem our pain and suffering, bringing about something beautiful and meaningful in the end.<h3>Think About It</h3><p>Reflect on a difficult experience in your life. How have you seen God bring about good or use that experience to shape you into who you are today? How does this give you hope for the future?<h3>Key Point 7: The Role of Evil in God's Plan of Salvation</h3><p>When Jesus was arrested, He told His enemies, "This is your hour—when darkness reigns" (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/22/Luke-22-53.html>Luke 22:53</a>). This statement suggests that evil had been granted a window of opportunity, and evil men were taking full advantage of it. That dark night led to the salvation of mankind. All things work "for the good of those who love [God], who have been called according to his purpose" (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/8/Romans-8-28.html>Romans 8:28</a>). God only permits that which will lead to His sovereign will being accomplished.<h3>Why This Matters</h3><p>Recognizing the role of evil in God's plan of salvation helps us understand the significance of Christ's sacrifice and the redemptive power of His love. It reminds us that even in the darkest moments, God is working for our ultimate good.<h3>Think About It</h3><p>How does understanding the role of evil in God's plan impact your appreciation for Christ's sacrifice? How does it deepen your understanding of God's love and His desire for our redemption?<p>In conclusion, understanding God's permissive will helps us make sense of the presence of evil and suffering in the world. It reminds us that God is sovereign and omniscient, allowing us to exercise our free will while still working His perfect plan. Although God permits evil and sinful decisions, He ultimately limits their reach, uses them for a greater good, and accomplishes His sovereign will. Trusting in God's permissive will enables us to navigate life's challenges with faith and hope, knowing that He is always in control.</section><div class=author-info><img alt="Maisha Johnson" class=author-image loading=lazy src=https://biblebasedliving.com/images/profile.png><div class=author-details><h4>Maisha Johnson</h4><p>Written by Maisha Johnson, a dedicated Christian writer known for her inspiring narratives and deep spiritual insights.

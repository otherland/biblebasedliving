While Jesus is the foundation for the Christian faith, He Himself could not be called a Christian. Christianity is built upon His identity as the Son of God, His perfect life, and His substitutionary death and resurrection for the forgiveness of sins.<p>Jesus did not come into the world to start another religion. He came to complete the work of God in redeeming sinful mankind. He came to defeat our enemy, Satan. He came to seek and save the lost. He came to fulfill the righteous requirements of the law. He came to establish a new covenant between God and mankind. He came "to redeem us from all wickedness and to purify for himself a people that are his very own, eager to do what is good."<p>Christianity is the result of Christ's finished work of salvation, and He now builds His church. Christianity is not a religion in the sense that it is man's attempt to reach up to God; rather, Christianity teaches that God has reached down to man. Jesus, as the second Person of the Trinity, took on human flesh and was literally God reaching out to us.<h2>Jesus as a Jewish Rabbi</h2><iframe allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen frameborder=0 height=315 src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/-LOG2i9m_f4 width=560></iframe><p>Jesus was not a Christian; He was a Jewish rabbi. Jesus followed the Jewish law that God had given to Moses. He lived perfectly under the law in order to present Himself as a sacrifice without blemish, acceptable under that law.<p>The coming of Jesus was the fulfillment of God's promise to send His Messiah to rescue His people and reign over them forever. For centuries, God had promised this deliverance and through Jesus, it was finally realized.<h2>The Term "Christian"</h2><p>Another reason that Jesus cannot be called a Christian is that the term itself was not coined until after His resurrection and ascension into heaven. Believers were first called Christians in the city of Antioch in Syria. The term means "little Christs" and was originally used in a derogatory way. However, believers came to embrace it as a badge of honor. Christians today should obey the voice of their Master and still consider themselves "little Christs" in the sense that they imitate the Lord Jesus.<h2>Why This Matters</h2><p>Understanding that Jesus was not a Christian helps us to grasp the unique role He played in God's plan of salvation. It emphasizes His divinity as the Son of God and the fulfillment of God's promises throughout history. Recognizing Jesus as a Jewish rabbi also highlights the importance of understanding the Jewish roots of Christianity and how Jesus perfectly fulfilled the Old Testament law.<h2>Think About It</h2><p>Consider the significance of Jesus being called the Messiah, the Anointed One. How does this title reflect His role as both Savior and King? How does understanding Jesus' Jewish identity impact your understanding of Christianity? Reflect on how you can strive to be a "little Christ," imitating Jesus in your thoughts, words, and actions.</section><div class=author-info><img alt="Maisha Johnson" class=author-image loading=lazy src=https://biblebasedliving.com/images/profile.png><div class=author-details><h4>Maisha Johnson</h4><p>Written by Maisha Johnson, a dedicated Christian writer known for her inspiring narratives and deep spiritual insights.

relationship between Jesus, Jews, Christians, and Judaism. We will address the question of why Christians do not follow Judaism despite Jesus being a Jew. It is important to understand that the laws of Judaism were given to Moses for the children of Israel in a sacred covenant at Mount Sinai. This covenant was recorded in the book of Exodus, and Israel was commanded to be obedient to all that was revealed to them.<h3>The Covenant of Moses</h3><p>The covenant given to the children of Israel through Moses was a special and significant event in their history. God wrote His laws on tablets of stone, and Israel was expected to obey them faithfully. However, this covenant was only a foreshadowing of a new and better covenant that God would establish with His people in the future.<h3>The New Covenant</h3><p>The new covenant is prophesied in <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Jeremiah/31/Jeremiah-31-31.html>Jeremiah 31:31-34</a>. God declares that He will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and the house of Judah. This new covenant would not be like the one made with their forefathers when they were led out of Egypt because they had broken that covenant. In this new covenant, God would put His law in their minds and write it on their hearts. He would be their God, and they would be His people. In this new covenant, everyone would know the Lord personally, and their sins would be forgiven.<h3>Jesus Fulfills the Old Covenant</h3><p>Christians do not follow Judaism today because Jesus Christ has fulfilled the Mosaic covenant. Jesus Himself said, "Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them" (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/5/Matthew-5-17.html>Matthew 5:17</a>). The writer of Hebrews also affirms this fulfillment, stating that by calling the new covenant "new," God has made the first one obsolete (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/8/Hebrews-8-13.html>Hebrews 8:13</a>).</p><iframe allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen frameborder=0 height=315 src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/9bbjW6zGlTc width=560></iframe><h3>A Better Covenant</h3><p>Through Jesus, Christians have entered into a better covenant. This new covenant is superior to the old covenant because it is established on better promises and has a better sacrifice. In the old covenant, sacrifices had to be made repeatedly for the forgiveness of sins. However, in the new covenant, Jesus' sacrificial death on the cross serves as the ultimate and final atonement for sin.<h3>Access to God</h3><p>In the old covenant, only the high priest could enter the Most Holy Place in the temple once a year to make atonement for the people's sins. However, in the new covenant, all believers have direct access to God through Jesus Christ. The writer of Hebrews encourages believers to draw near to God with confidence because of the blood of Jesus that cleanses them from guilt and gives them assurance of faith.<h3>Holding Unswervingly to Hope</h3><p>As Christians, we are called to hold unswervingly to the hope we profess. This hope is grounded in the faithfulness of God and the promises of the new covenant. The writer of Hebrews urges believers to persevere in their faith, knowing that Christ is a faithful high priest who intercedes for them before God.<h2>Why This Matters</h2><p>Understanding the relationship between Jesus, Jews, Christians, and Judaism is crucial for Christians as it helps us grasp the significance of Jesus' life, death, and resurrection. It reveals how Jesus fulfilled the law and established a new covenant that offers forgiveness, direct access to God, and eternal hope.<h2>Think About It</h2><ol><li>Consider how the new covenant through Jesus Christ provides a greater understanding of God's love and grace compared to the old covenant.<li>Reflect on how having direct access to God through Jesus Christ impacts your relationship with Him.<li>Ponder on the importance of holding unswervingly to the hope we have in Christ, especially in challenging times.</ol></section><div class=author-info><img alt="Maisha Johnson" class=author-image loading=lazy src=https://biblebasedliving.com/images/profile.png><div class=author-details><h4>Maisha Johnson</h4><p>Written by Maisha Johnson, a dedicated Christian writer known for her inspiring narratives and deep spiritual insights.

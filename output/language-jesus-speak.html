Hebrew, and Greek. Of these, Aramaic was the language he used most frequently. Aramaic was the common or colloquial language in Israel during Jesus' time and it was very similar to Hebrew, with borrowed words and phrases from other languages and cultures, particularly Babylonian. Some of the Aramaic words spoken by Jesus that are recorded in the Gospels include "talitha koum" (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/5/Mark-5-41.html>Mark 5:41</a>), "ephphatha" (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/7/Mark-7-34.html>Mark 7:34</a>), "eloi eloi lama sabachthani" (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/27/Matthew-27-46.html>Matthew 27:46</a>; <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/15/Mark-15-34.html>Mark 15:34</a>), and "abba" (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/14/Mark-14-36.html>Mark 14:36</a>).<h3>Why This Matters</h3><p>Understanding the language Jesus spoke helps us gain insight into his cultural context and the way he communicated with others. It allows us to better understand the nuances of his teachings and interactions with different individuals and groups.<h3>Hebrew as the Language of the Elite</h3><p>While Aramaic was the common language, Hebrew held a significant place in religious contexts. Hebrew was primarily spoken by the scribes, teachers of the law, Pharisees, and Sadducees—the religious elite of that time. Hebrew was likely read in synagogues, so most people would have been able to speak and understand some Hebrew.<h3>Think About It</h3><p>Consider how Jesus used different languages to communicate effectively with various audiences. What might be some reasons for him choosing to speak in a particular language at a given time?</p><iframe allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen frameborder=0 height=315 src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/gJ1x2oFuvMs width=560></iframe><h3>Greek as the Language of Power</h3><p>During Jesus' time, Greek was the language of the Romans who held power over Israel. It was also the language of commerce and trade, making it essential for anyone who wanted to do business with the Romans. Greek had become a universal language at that time, facilitating communication across different cultures. Although some people refused to speak Greek as a sign of resentment toward their Roman oppressors, it was still widely spoken.<h3>Jesus' Multilingualism</h3><p>As God incarnate, Jesus had the ability to speak any language he chose. However, in his humanity, he likely limited himself to the languages commonly used in his culture: Aramaic, Hebrew, and Greek. He would have chosen the language that was most appropriate for the audience he was addressing.<h3>Why This Matters</h3><p>Jesus' ability to speak multiple languages demonstrates his understanding and empathy for diverse cultures and individuals. It also highlights his desire to effectively communicate his message to people from different backgrounds.<h3>Language and Pontius Pilate</h3><p>When Jesus stood before Pontius Pilate, it is possible that he spoke to him in Greek. As the governor, Pilate would likely have been able to speak Aramaic as well. However, since Greek was the language of the ruling Romans, it is reasonable to assume that Jesus used Greek when interacting with Pilate.<h3>Think About It</h3><p>Reflect on the significance of Jesus speaking in Greek during his conversation with Pilate. What messages or implications could this choice of language convey?<h3>Conclusion</h3><p>While Jesus likely spoke Aramaic, Hebrew, and Greek, Aramaic was the language he spoke most frequently. It was the common language of Israel at that time. Hebrew was primarily used in religious contexts, and Greek was the language of power and commerce. Jesus, being fully God and fully human, had the ability to speak any language but chose to use the languages common to his culture. His multilingualism allowed him to effectively communicate with diverse audiences and demonstrate his understanding of their unique contexts.</section><div class=author-info><img alt="Maisha Johnson" class=author-image loading=lazy src=https://biblebasedliving.com/images/profile.png><div class=author-details><h4>Maisha Johnson</h4><p>Written by Maisha Johnson, a dedicated Christian writer known for her inspiring narratives and deep spiritual insights.

Contrary to popular belief, "Christ" is not Jesus' last name but rather a title given to Him. The word "Christ" originates from the Greek word "Christos," which translates to "anointed one" or "chosen one." This Greek term is equivalent to the Hebrew word "Messiah." Therefore, when we refer to Jesus Christ, we are acknowledging Him as Jesus the Messiah or Jesus the Anointed One.<p>In ancient Israel, anointing with oil was a symbolic act that represented someone being set apart for God's service. It was commonly performed when individuals were appointed to positions of authority, such as kings, priests, and prophets. The anointing signified God's choosing and consecration of the individual for a specific purpose. While the literal meaning of anointing refers to the application of oil, it can also signify one's consecration by God, even if actual oil is not used.<p>Throughout the Old Testament, there are numerous prophetic passages that foretell the coming of a Messiah who would deliver God's people from various hardships and challenges. These prophecies created an expectation among ancient Israelites that their Messiah would arrive with military might and liberate them from their captivity under earthly kings and pagan nations. However, the New Testament reveals that Jesus the Messiah brings about a far greater deliverance. His mission is not only to rescue people from physical oppressors but also to save them from the power and penalty of sin itself.<p>Jesus embodies the title of Christ through two significant anointings. On two separate occasions, He was anointed with oil by two different women. These acts are recorded in <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/26/Matthew-26-6.html>Matthew 26:6</a>–7 and <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/7/Luke-7-37.html>Luke 7:37</a>–38. Although these events hold importance, the most significant anointing Jesus received was through the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit's anointing upon Jesus signifies that He is God's chosen and anointed one, fulfilling the Old Testament prophecies concerning the Messiah.<p>Understanding the title of Christ is crucial for Christians as it highlights Jesus' role as the Savior and Deliverer. The Bible often refers to Jesus as the Christ, emphasizing His divine appointment and mission. By recognizing Jesus as the Christ, Christians acknowledge Him as the fulfillment of God's promise to send a Messiah to rescue humanity from sin and its consequences.</p><iframe allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen frameborder=0 height=315 src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/bYVcQ7PDaPg width=560></iframe><h3>Why This Matters</h3><p>Understanding the meaning behind the title "Christ" deepens our comprehension of Jesus' purpose and significance. It emphasizes that Jesus is not merely a historical figure or a wise teacher but rather God's chosen Savior who came to redeem humanity. Recognizing Jesus as the Christ encourages us to place our trust in Him and rely on His work of salvation.<p>By embracing Jesus as the Christ, we acknowledge that He has the authority and power to deliver us from sin, reconcile us with God, and grant us eternal life. This understanding shapes our faith, hope, and relationship with Him. It also motivates us to share this good news with others so that they, too, may come to know Jesus as their Savior.<h3>Think About It</h3><ol><li>Have you ever considered what the term "Christ" means and its significance in relation to Jesus?<li>How does understanding Jesus as the Christ impact your understanding of His work of salvation?<li>Reflect on how embracing Jesus as the Christ shapes your daily life and interactions with others.<li>Consider how you can share the good news of Jesus' role as the Christ with those around you who may not be familiar with this concept.</ol></section><div class=author-info><img alt="Maisha Johnson" class=author-image loading=lazy src=https://biblebasedliving.com/images/profile.png><div class=author-details><h4>Maisha Johnson</h4><p>Written by Maisha Johnson, a dedicated Christian writer known for her inspiring narratives and deep spiritual insights.

Although it can be challenging for our finite minds to comprehend, the Bible affirms that Jesus was fully God and fully human. It is crucial to reject false views that either deny His divinity or His humanity, as both are biblical truths.<h3>Jesus as a Human Being</h3><p>Jesus was born as a human being to fulfill God's plan of redemption. <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Galatians/4/Galatians-4-4.html>Galatians 4:4</a>–5 explains that God sent His Son, born of a woman and under the law, to redeem those under the law. By being born as a human, Jesus could fulfill the requirements of the law on behalf of humanity. Only a perfect human, without sin, could perfectly keep and fulfill the law. Through His sacrificial death on the cross, Jesus exchanged our sin for His perfect righteousness.<h3>The Necessity of Jesus' Humanity</h3><p>There are several reasons why Jesus had to be fully human. Firstly, God established the shedding of blood as necessary for the forgiveness of sins (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Leviticus/17/Leviticus-17-11.html>Leviticus 17:11</a>; <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/9/Hebrews-9-22.html>Hebrews 9:22</a>). While animal sacrifices foreshadowed the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus, they were insufficient to permanently remove sin. Jesus, as the perfect Lamb of God, sacrificed His own human life and shed His blood to cover the sins of all who believe in Him.</p><iframe allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen frameborder=0 height=315 src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/R9qoqQ75ifs width=560></iframe><p>Secondly, Jesus' humanity enabled Him to be tempted just like we are. <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/4/Hebrews-4-15.html>Hebrews 4:15</a> asserts that Jesus was tempted in every way as we are, yet He was without sin. By experiencing human trials and temptations firsthand, Jesus can sympathize with our weaknesses and understand our struggles. This truth gives us confidence that He is a compassionate and understanding high priest.<h3>The Significance of Jesus' Incarnation</h3><p>Declaring that Jesus has come in the flesh is an essential mark of being led by the Spirit of God (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/1-John/4/1-John-4-2.html>1 John 4:2</a>–3). The Antichrist and those who follow him will deny this truth. Jesus indeed came in the flesh, sinlessly experiencing our human frailties. His human blood was shed for our sins, and He was fully God and fully Man. These biblical truths cannot be denied.<h3>Why This Matters</h3><p>Understanding the humanity of Jesus is crucial for several reasons. Firstly, it reveals the depth of God's love and His desire to identify with humanity. Jesus willingly took on human form to redeem us and restore our relationship with God. Secondly, Jesus' humanity enables Him to empathize with us and intercede on our behalf as a compassionate high priest. Knowing that Jesus has experienced the same trials and temptations as us gives us comfort and assurance in our faith.<h3>Think About It</h3><p>The humanity of Jesus challenges us to reflect on the significance of His incarnation. It compels us to consider the immense sacrifice He made by becoming one of us, enduring suffering, and ultimately laying down His life for our salvation. Moreover, it reminds us that Jesus understands our struggles intimately and invites us to approach Him boldly in times of need.<p>In conclusion, the humanity of Jesus is a fundamental aspect of His identity. He was born as a human being while remaining fully divine. His humanity allowed Him to fulfill the requirements of the law and serve as the perfect sacrifice for our sins. By experiencing human trials and temptations, Jesus can sympathize with our weaknesses and intercede on our behalf. Recognizing the humanity of Jesus deepens our understanding of God's love and encourages us to approach Him confidently in our times of need.</section><div class=author-info><img alt="Maisha Johnson" class=author-image loading=lazy src=https://biblebasedliving.com/images/profile.png><div class=author-details><h4>Maisha Johnson</h4><p>Written by Maisha Johnson, a dedicated Christian writer known for her inspiring narratives and deep spiritual insights.

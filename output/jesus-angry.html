Bible, there are instances where Jesus displayed anger. It is important to understand that Jesus' anger was not fueled by selfishness or personal slights; rather, it was motivated by His zeal for God's house and His concern for holiness and worship. His anger had the right focus, targeting sinful behavior and true injustice, rather than being directed at God or others' weaknesses.<h3>The Right Motivation for Anger</h3><p>Jesus' anger had the proper motivation. It arose from genuine and righteous reasons, not from petty arguments or personal offenses against Him. There was no selfishness involved in His anger. Instead, Jesus' anger was driven by His deep concern for God's holiness and the true worship of God.<h3>The Right Focus for Anger</h3><p>Jesus' anger had the proper focus. He was not angry at God or at the weaknesses of others. His anger was directed at sinful behavior and genuine injustice. Jesus' desire was to address these issues and bring about righteousness and justice in the world.<h3>The Right Supplement to Anger</h3><p>When Jesus became angry, it was accompanied by grief over the lack of faith displayed by those He confronted. His anger stemmed from love for the people and concern for their spiritual condition. It had nothing to do with hatred or ill will. Jesus' anger was always rooted in a genuine desire to see people turn to God and experience His love and grace.<h3>The Right Control over Anger</h3><p>Jesus never lost control of His emotions, even in moments of anger. He demonstrated self-control and always acted in accordance with God's will. When He cleared the temple of the moneychangers and animal-sellers, He did so in a measured and purposeful manner. Jesus' emotions were always under control, and He never allowed His anger to lead Him into sin.<h3>The Right Duration of Anger</h3><iframe allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen frameborder=0 height=315 src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/OuNwEyP6BvM width=560></iframe><p>Jesus did not allow His anger to turn into bitterness or grudges. He dealt with each situation properly and in a timely manner. Jesus' anger was always focused on accomplishing God's will, and once the situation was addressed, He moved on without holding onto anger or resentment.<h3>The Right Result of Anger</h3><p>Jesus' anger always led to godly action. When He became angry, it inevitably resulted in righteous behavior and the fulfillment of God's purposes. Jesus' actions were guided by the Word of God, and His response to anger was always aimed at accomplishing God's will.<h4>Why This Matters</h4><p>Understanding Jesus' anger helps us navigate our own emotions. It teaches us that anger itself is not inherently sinful, but rather how we handle it determines whether it becomes destructive or righteous. We should strive to have the right motivation, focus, supplement, control, duration, and result when dealing with anger. By following Jesus' example, we can address injustice and sin in a way that honors God and promotes His kingdom.<h4>Think About It</h4><ol><li>Have you ever experienced anger that was motivated by righteous reasons? How did you handle it?<li>How can we ensure that our anger is focused on addressing sin and injustice rather than being directed at God or others' weaknesses?<li>In what ways can we supplement our anger with love and concern for the spiritual well-being of others?<li>How can we maintain control over our emotions, particularly when experiencing anger?<li>Reflect on a time when your anger led to godly action. What lessons can you draw from that experience?</ol><p>By examining Jesus' display of anger, we can learn valuable lessons about handling our own emotions and seeking to bring about righteousness in the world around us. Let us strive to follow Jesus' example by having the right motivation, focus, supplement, control, duration, and result when dealing with anger.</section><div class=author-info><img alt="Maisha Johnson" class=author-image loading=lazy src=https://biblebasedliving.com/images/profile.png><div class=author-details><h4>Maisha Johnson</h4><p>Written by Maisha Johnson, a dedicated Christian writer known for her inspiring narratives and deep spiritual insights.

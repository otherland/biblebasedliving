holiness. Holiness means being set apart, and God is clearly separate from His creation based on His nature and attributes. In the Bible, <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Revelation/15/Revelation-15-4.html>Revelation 15:4</a> says, "You alone are holy," and <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Revelation/4/Revelation-4-8.html>Revelation 4:8</a> describes the four living creatures singing to God day and night, "Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God Almighty." God's holiness makes Him a "consuming fire" that will judge all sin (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/12/Hebrews-12-29.html>Hebrews 12:29</a>). Throughout Scripture, there are beautiful doxologies that exalt God's holiness, such as <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/99/Psalm-99-9.html>Psalm 99:9</a>, <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/33/Psalm-33-21.html>Psalm 33:21</a>, <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/77/Psalm-77-13.html>Psalm 77:13</a>, <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/89/Psalm-89-18.html>Psalm 89:18</a>, and <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/105/Psalm-105-3.html>Psalm 105:3</a>.<p><strong>Why This Matters:</strong> Understanding God's holiness helps us recognize His uniqueness and separateness from the world. It reminds us that we should approach Him with reverence and awe.<p><strong>Think About It:</strong> How does recognizing God's holiness impact your worship and relationship with Him?<h3>The Trinity</h3><p>God is an eternal spirit who has always existed in three distinct persons: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. He is one God (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Deuteronomy/6/Deuteronomy-6-4.html>Deuteronomy 6:4</a>) but exists as three Persons. While God does not have a physical body, the Son became incarnate in Jesus Christ. Denying the Trinity or viewing God the Father as a man is a false doctrine. It is essential to affirm both the humanity and deity of Christ (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/2-John/1/2-John-1-7.html>2 John 1:7</a>).<p><strong>Why This Matters:</strong> Understanding the Trinity teaches us about the complexity and unity within the nature of God. It also helps us understand how each person of the Trinity plays a unique role in our salvation.<p><strong>Think About It:</strong> How does recognizing the Trinity affect your understanding of salvation?<h3>God's Sovereignty</h3><p>God, by nature, is sovereign. He has absolute authority over the entire universe and everything in it. His sovereignty is expressed in many ways, including His omnipotence. All of God's ways are right (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/145/Psalm-145-17.html>Psalm 145:17</a>), and He is not constrained by time or place. He has a plan that has been in place from eternity past, and His purpose will be accomplished (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Daniel/4/Daniel-4-37.html>Daniel 4:37</a>, <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/115/Psalm-115-3.html>Psalm 115:3</a>).</p><iframe allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen frameborder=0 height=315 src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/QPywCD-TSd0 width=560></iframe><p><strong>Why This Matters:</strong> Recognizing God's sovereignty helps us trust in His plans and purposes even when we don't understand them. It reminds us that God is ultimately in control.<p><strong>Think About It:</strong> How does understanding God's sovereignty impact your faith and trust in Him?<h3>God's Immutability</h3><p>God does not change; He is the same "yesterday, today, and forever" (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/13/Hebrews-13-8.html>Hebrews 13:8</a>). He explicitly states in <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Malachi/3/Malachi-3-6.html>Malachi 3:6</a>, "I the LORD do not change." Because of His unchanging nature, we can depend on His blessings. <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/James/1/James-1-17.html>James 1:17</a> says, "Every good and perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of the heavenly lights, who does not change like shifting shadows."<p><strong>Why This Matters:</strong> Understanding God's immutability reassures us that His character and promises remain steadfast. We can rely on Him to be consistent in His love, mercy, and faithfulness.<p><strong>Think About It:</strong> How does knowing that God does not change impact your relationship with Him?<h3>God's Omniscience</h3><p>God knows everything from eternity past to eternity future. He knows everything we think, do, and say. He has personal knowledge of every person who has ever lived or will live, knowing them intimately in every way. <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Jeremiah/1/Jeremiah-1-5.html>Jeremiah 1:5</a> says, "Before I formed you in the womb I knew you, before you were born, I set you apart."<p><strong>Why This Matters:</strong> Recognizing God's omniscience brings comfort and assurance. It reminds us that we are known and loved by a God who understands us completely.<p><strong>Think About It:</strong> How does the knowledge that God knows everything impact your prayer life and sense of security?<h3>God's Love and Wrath</h3><p>God's nature encompasses both love and wrath. He has a righteous anger against sin (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/7/Psalm-7-11.html>Psalm 7:11</a>). However, out of His love for the world, He sent His only Son, Jesus Christ, to redeem us (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/John/3/John-3-16.html>John 3:16</a>). God is not only loving but is love itself (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/1-John/4/1-John-4-16.html>1 John 4:16</a>). His love is eternal, unchanging, perfect, and holy.<p><strong>Why This Matters:</strong> Understanding God's love and wrath helps us grasp the depth of His character and the significance of our salvation through Jesus Christ. It also highlights the importance of sharing the gospel message with others.<p><strong>Think About It:</strong> How does knowing God's love and wrath impact your understanding of salvation and your relationship with others?<h3>Conclusion</h3><p>The nature of God is multifaceted and complex. He is holy, separate from His creation. He exists as three distinct persons in the Trinity while being one God. God is sovereign, immutable, omniscient, loving, and just. Understanding these aspects of God's nature deepens our faith, shapes our worship, and strengthens our relationship with Him.<p><strong>Why This Matters:</strong> Our understanding of God's nature shapes our theology and informs how we live out our faith daily.<p><strong>Think About It:</strong> How can you apply what you have learned about the nature of God to your life?</section><div class=author-info><img alt="Maisha Johnson" class=author-image loading=lazy src=https://biblebasedliving.com/images/profile.png><div class=author-details><h4>Maisha Johnson</h4><p>Written by Maisha Johnson, a dedicated Christian writer known for her inspiring narratives and deep spiritual insights.

it involves the nature of God as three distinct Persons in one. The Trinity consists of God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit. These three Persons are coequal and coeternal, meaning none is inferior or superior to the other. In this article, we will focus on God the Son.<h3>Who is God the Son?</h3><p>God the Son is the second Person of the Trinity. He is revealed to creation as the only and eternally begotten Son of God the Father. While He shares the same essence with God the Father and God the Holy Spirit, He is distinct from them in Personhood and function. God the Son has always existed as fully God (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/John/1/John-1-1.html>John 1:1</a>–2), and He is one with God the Father. However, He submits Himself to the Father in function and work. His primary role is to fulfill the will of God the Father (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/John/6/John-6-38.html>John 6:38</a>).<h3>The Incarnation</h3><p>Although God the Son is fully divine, He became fully human through an event known as the incarnation. In this act, He took on flesh and experienced humanity in all its aspects, including temptations, trials, weaknesses, and emotions. The purpose of the incarnation was not for Him to lose His divinity or any divine attributes but to perfectly obey the will of God the Father while living as a human being (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Philippians/2/Philippians-2-5.html>Philippians 2:5</a>–11; <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/2/Hebrews-2-17.html>Hebrews 2:17</a>).<h3>Life and Ministry of Jesus</h3><p>As Jesus Christ, God the Son was conceived by the power of God the Holy Spirit and born of a virgin named Mary. He lived a perfect life without sin and grew in wisdom, stature, and favor with both God and humanity. Jesus embarked on a public ministry where He taught people about God's ways and truths. Large crowds followed Him, and He performed numerous miracles, healing people from sicknesses, diseases, and deformities.</p><iframe allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen frameborder=0 height=315 src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/0SOJEyzdg-M width=560></iframe><h3>Rejection and Crucifixion</h3><p>Over time, Jesus' teachings and miracles caused some religious leaders to feel threatened, leading them to seek His death. Eventually, Jesus was arrested and put on trial before Jewish and Roman authorities who sentenced Him to death. He was crucified on a cross to pay for the sins of the world. After His death, Jesus was buried in a tomb for three days.<h3>Resurrection and Salvation</h3><p>On the third day, Jesus rose from the dead by the power of God the Holy Spirit. His resurrection serves as the firstfruits of the new creation promised by God and guarantees the future resurrection of believers upon His return. Through His substitutionary death on the cross and resurrection, God the Son purchased eternal salvation for all those who receive Him by faith.<h3>Current Role and Future Return</h3><p>Currently, God the Son rules and reigns as the Great High Priest at the right hand of God the Father. He is exalted above all things and intercedes before God the Father on behalf of His people. One day, He will visibly return to earth, defeat all enemies of God, and establish His kingdom where He will rule with His saints for all eternity.<h4>Why This Matters</h4><p>Understanding the nature of God the Son is essential because it reveals God's love for humanity. Through the incarnation and sacrifice of Jesus Christ, we gain access to salvation and are reconciled to God. Recognizing Jesus as fully divine and fully human helps us grasp the depth of God's love for us and enables us to have a personal relationship with Him.<h4>Think About It</h4><p>Consider how Jesus' role as both fully divine and fully human impacts your understanding of salvation. How does this truth shape your relationship with God? Reflect on the significance of Jesus' sacrificial death on the cross and what it means for your life.</section><div class=author-info><img alt="Maisha Johnson" class=author-image loading=lazy src=https://biblebasedliving.com/images/profile.png><div class=author-details><h4>Maisha Johnson</h4><p>Written by Maisha Johnson, a dedicated Christian writer known for her inspiring narratives and deep spiritual insights.

In <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Malachi/3/Malachi-3-6.html>Malachi 3:6</a>, it says, "I the LORD do not change. So you, O descendants of Jacob, are not destroyed." This verse emphasizes the immutability of God. Similarly, <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/James/1/James-1-17.html>James 1:17</a> states, "Every good and perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of the heavenly lights, who does not change like shifting shadows." These verses make it clear that God is unchanging and unchangeable.<p>It is important to understand that when we talk about God changing His mind, it does not mean that He realizes a mistake and tries a different approach. That would imply a lack of wisdom on God's part. Instead, we need to interpret these passages in light of the overall biblical teaching on the nature of God.<h2>Anthropopathism: Understanding God's Feelings</h2><p>There are verses in the Bible that seem to suggest that God changes His mind. For example, <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/6/Genesis-6-6.html>Genesis 6:6</a> says, "The LORD was grieved that He had made man on the earth, and His heart was filled with pain." <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Exodus/32/Exodus-32-14.html>Exodus 32:14</a> also states, "Then the LORD relented and did not bring on His people the disaster He had threatened." These passages use anthropopathism, which is a figure of speech where human emotions and thought processes are attributed to God. It helps us understand God's work from a human perspective.<p>In <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/6/Genesis-6-6.html>Genesis 6:6</a>, when it says that God was grieved over making man, it doesn't mean that He regretted creating humanity. It is an anthropomorphic expression to convey God's sorrow over man's sin. We are alive today because God did not change His mind about creating us.<h2>Conditional Declarations vs. Determinations</h2><p>To further understand passages where it seems like God changes His mind, we need to differentiate between declarations and determinations of God. Declarations are statements that depend on our response, while determinations are unconditional promises or prophecies.</p><iframe allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen frameborder=0 height=315 src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/HYAtepiTod8 width=560></iframe><p>For example, in the story of Jonah, God declared through His prophet that He would destroy Nineveh in forty days. However, when the people of Nineveh repented, God relented from bringing judgment upon them. This apparent change of mind was not a contradiction of God's immutability. It was a conditional declaration given to provoke repentance, and it achieved its purpose.<p>An example of an unconditional determination is God's promise to David that his house and kingdom would endure forever (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/2-Samuel/7/2-Samuel-7-16.html>2 Samuel 7:16</a>). There was no qualification or condition attached to this promise. Regardless of what David did or didn't do, God's word would come to pass.<h2>The Consistency of God</h2><p>God's consistency is a vital aspect of His character. When we observe apparent changes in God's treatment or response to us, it does not mean that His character has changed. In fact, because God does not change, He treats the righteous and the unrighteous differently.<p>If someone repents, God consistently forgives. Conversely, if someone refuses to repent, God consistently judges. His nature, plan, and being remain constant. He cannot be pleased with the contrite one day and angry with them the next. That would make Him mutable and untrustworthy.<p>When we see instances like God warning Nineveh of judgment and then sparing them after their repentance, it may seem like He changed His mind. However, in reality, God is staying true to His character. He loves mercy and forgives the penitent.<h2>Our Relationship with God</h2><p>At one point, we were all enemies of God due to our sin (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/8/Romans-8-7.html>Romans 8:7</a>). But when we repented and trusted in Christ for salvation, God "changed His mind" about us. We are no longer enemies but His beloved children (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/John/1/John-1-12.html>John 1:12</a>). This transformation demonstrates that God does not change.<p>Our salvation does not mean that God changed; rather, it shows that He acted consistently with His character. Had He not saved us for the sake of Christ, He would have acted contrary to His nature. The fact that God warned us about the consequences of sin and then offered forgiveness through repentance is a testimony to God's unchanging love and mercy.<h2>Why This Matters</h2><p>Understanding that God does not change is crucial for our faith and trust in Him. It assures us that His promises are secure and His character is reliable. We can have confidence in His immutability, knowing that He will consistently respond to our choices.<p>Recognizing that some passages use anthropopathism helps us grasp the depth of God's emotions and thoughts without attributing human limitations to Him. It allows us to see things from a human perspective while acknowledging the infinite nature of God.<h2>Think About It</h2><p>Consider how your understanding of God's immutability affects your trust in Him. Reflect on how knowing that God does not change impacts your relationship with Him. How does the fact that God consistently responds to our choices reflect His character? Take time to meditate on these truths and let them deepen your faith in an unchanging God.</section><div class=author-info><img alt="Maisha Johnson" class=author-image loading=lazy src=https://biblebasedliving.com/images/profile.png><div class=author-details><h4>Maisha Johnson</h4><p>Written by Maisha Johnson, a dedicated Christian writer known for her inspiring narratives and deep spiritual insights.

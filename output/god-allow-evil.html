The Bible describes God as holy, righteous, just, and sovereign. These attributes tell us that God is capable of preventing evil and desires to rid the universe of evil. So, if both of these statements are true, why does God allow evil to exist?<h3>The Problem of Free Will</h3><p>One way to understand why God allows evil is to consider the alternative ways in which He could have created the world. For example, God could have chosen to change everyone's personality so that they cannot sin. However, this would also mean that we would not have free will. We would not be able to choose between right and wrong because we would be programmed to only do what is right. While this may eliminate evil, it would also eliminate meaningful relationships between God and His creation.<p>Instead, God made Adam and Eve innocent with the ability to choose good or evil. They could respond to His love and trust Him or choose to disobey. Unfortunately, they chose to disobey, and their sin affected all of humanity. Our decisions to sin also have consequences on ourselves and those around us. This is a result of living in a world where we can choose our actions but not their consequences.<h3>The Limitations of Supernatural Intervention</h3><p>Another alternative way in which God could have dealt with evil is by compensating for people's evil actions through supernatural intervention 100 percent of the time. In this scenario, God would stop any drunk driver from causing an accident, prevent lazy construction workers from doing substandard jobs, stop fathers addicted to drugs or alcohol from harming their families, prevent thieves from stealing, and intervene in countless other situations.</p><iframe allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen frameborder=0 height=315 src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/XBIXPr6AH4A width=560></iframe><p>While this solution may sound attractive, it would lose its appeal when God's intervention infringes on something we want to do. We may want God to prevent horribly evil actions, but we are often willing to let "lesser-evil" actions slide. What we fail to realize is that these "lesser-evil" actions often lead to greater evil. For example, should God only stop actual sexual affairs or should He also prevent access to pornography or end inappropriate relationships? Should God only stop murder or should He also prevent the "lesser-evil" actions that lead to murder? The line between what God should and shouldn't intervene in becomes blurred.<h3>The Consequences of Judgment</h3><p>A third option would be for God to judge and remove those who choose to commit evil acts. However, if God were to do this, there would be no one left. We all sin and commit evil acts to some extent. While some people may be more evil than others, all evil causes harm to others.<p>Instead of these alternatives, God chose to create a "real" world where choices have consequences. Our actions in this world have direct and indirect effects on ourselves and those around us. As a result of Adam's choice to sin, the world now lives under a curse, and we are all born with a sin nature. However, God has not abandoned us to our sinful state. He is delaying judgment in order to give people more time to repent and turn to Him.<h3>God's Concern for Evil</h3><p>Throughout history, God has shown His concern for evil. In the Old Testament, when He gave the Law, one of His goals was to discourage and punish evil. He has judged nations and rulers who disregard justice and pursue evil. In the New Testament, God states that it is the government's responsibility to provide justice and protect the innocent from evil.<p>God promises severe consequences for those who commit evil acts, especially against the innocent. He cares about justice and righteousness. However, it is important to note that God does not prevent all evil from occurring. This is because we live in a world where our choices have consequences, and God allows us to experience the results of our actions.<h3>The Cure for Evil</h3><p>Instead of blaming God for not preventing all evil, we should focus on the cure for evil and its consequences. Jesus came to change people's hearts through the power of the Holy Spirit. He offers salvation to those who turn from evil and call on Him to save them from sin and its consequences.<p>In conclusion, God allows evil to exist because He desires a world where choices have consequences. While He has the power to prevent evil, He also values our free will and the opportunity for us to choose Him. God cares about justice and righteousness, and He promises severe consequences for those who commit evil acts. Instead of questioning God on why He does not prevent all evil, we should focus on proclaiming the cure for evil—Jesus Christ.</section><div class=author-info><img alt="Maisha Johnson" class=author-image loading=lazy src=https://biblebasedliving.com/images/profile.png><div class=author-details><h4>Maisha Johnson</h4><p>Written by Maisha Johnson, a dedicated Christian writer known for her inspiring narratives and deep spiritual insights.

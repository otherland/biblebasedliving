Jesus, in His human form, knew that He was God. While the Bible does not explicitly address this question, there are indications that shed light on the matter.<ol><li><p>Jesus' Eternal Divinity: Jesus has always been God, the second Person of the Trinity. He existed as God from eternity past and will continue to be God for eternity future.</p><li><p>Jesus' Self-Realization as God: As an adult, Jesus fully realized His divine nature. In <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/John/8/John-8-58.html>John 8:58</a>, Jesus declared, "Before Abraham was born, I am!" This statement expresses His eternal existence and divine nature. Additionally, in <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/John/17/John-17-5.html>John 17:5</a>, Jesus prayed to the Father, asking Him to glorify Him with the glory they shared before the world began.</p></ol><iframe allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen frameborder=0 height=315 src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/GXBgPeZCipI width=560></iframe><ol><li><p>Jesus' Awareness as a Child: There are indications that even as a child, Jesus had an understanding of His divine identity and mission. When Joseph and Mary found Jesus missing during their journey back from Jerusalem, they discovered Him in the temple sitting among the teachers. When questioned about His actions, Jesus replied, "Why were you searching for me? . . . Didn’t you know I had to be in my Father’s house?" (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/2/Luke-2-49.html>Luke 2:49</a>). Although Joseph and Mary did not fully comprehend Jesus' words at that time, it suggests that Jesus already had awareness of His Sonship and the work ordained by the Father.</p><li><p>Jesus' Growth in Wisdom: <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/2/Luke-2-52.html>Luke 2:52</a> states that "Jesus grew in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and man." This growth implies that Jesus did not possess all knowledge from the beginning of His earthly life. While He never ceased being God, He willingly subjected Himself to human limitations and experienced physical, intellectual, social, and spiritual growth.</p><li><p>The Veiling of Divinity: Jesus, in His human form, veiled His divinity in accordance with the Father's will. This veiling included limitations and the need for knowledge assimilation. Thus, Jesus willingly chose to experience and learn as a man.</p><li><p>The Limitations of Human Perspective: It is important to recognize that our understanding of Jesus' knowledge is limited by our human perspective. From the heavenly perspective, the Son knew from eternity past who He was and what His earthly work would entail. However, from the earthly perspective, it is unclear when exactly Jesus fully comprehended His divinity. This is a mystery that remains undisclosed in Scripture.</p></ol><p><strong>Why This Matters:</strong><p>The question of when Jesus knew He was God holds theological significance as it explores the nature of Christ's incarnation and His humanity. Understanding Jesus' self-realization helps believers appreciate the depth of His sacrifice and the extent to which He identified with humanity. It also emphasizes Jesus' voluntary submission to human limitations.<p><strong>Think About It:</strong><p>Contemplating Jesus' self-realization invites us to reflect on the mystery of the Incarnation and the divine plan to save humanity. It reminds us that Jesus willingly entered into our world, experiencing growth, learning, and ultimately fulfilling His mission through His death and resurrection. Recognizing this deepens our appreciation for Jesus' love and sacrifice on our behalf.</section><div class=author-info><img alt="Maisha Johnson" class=author-image loading=lazy src=https://biblebasedliving.com/images/profile.png><div class=author-details><h4>Maisha Johnson</h4><p>Written by Maisha Johnson, a dedicated Christian writer known for her inspiring narratives and deep spiritual insights.

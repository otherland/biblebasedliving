omnipotence of God. While it is true that God has the power to do anything He wishes, there are certain limitations to what He will do. This is because God's actions are guided by His holy will and are not contradictory to His purposes. God is completely holy and sinless, so He will not commit any sinful acts. It is important to understand that just because God has the power to do something, it does not mean that He will actually do it.<p>An example that illustrates this is the question, "Can God make a stone so heavy that He can't lift it?" This question presents a paradox. If God is so powerful that He can create a stone of infinite weight, how would it be possible for Him not to be able to lift it? On the other hand, if the stone is truly of infinite weight, how would it be possible for Him to lift it? The answer lies in the fact that God will not deny Himself. In this case, it seems that He would not even consider such an idea because it would be pitting Himself against Himself, which serves no purpose in His kingdom.<p>Throughout the Bible, we see evidence of God's omnipotence. In <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Joshua/4/Joshua-4-24.html>Joshua 4:24</a>, we read about how God made a dry path in the mighty Jordan River to allow His people to pass safely. This was done so that all the peoples of the earth might know that the hand of the Lord is powerful and worthy of fear. <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Jeremiah/32/Jeremiah-32-26.html>Jeremiah 32:26-27</a> also affirms God's power, stating, "Then the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah: 'I am the LORD, the God of all mankind. Is anything too hard for me?'" These verses and others make it clear that all things within God's will are possible for Him.<p>It is worth noting that the angel in <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/1/Luke-1-36.html>Luke 1:36-37</a> proclaimed to Mary, "For nothing is impossible with God." Some may wonder if this means that they can run faster than a car or leap tall buildings. While it is within God's power to make those things possible, there is nothing in Scripture that indicates it is His desire to do so. Just because something is possible for God does not mean that He is obligated to make it happen. Therefore, it is important for us to be familiar with Scripture and understand what God desires and has promised so that we can know what He will make possible in our lives.<h3>Why This Matters</h3><iframe allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen frameborder=0 height=315 src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/EqYBXFYYsxc width=560></iframe><p>Understanding the concept of God's omnipotence and the limitations of His actions is important for our faith. It helps us to have a proper perspective of who God is and how He works in the world. Knowing that God can do anything within His will gives us confidence and assurance that He is in control, even in situations that seem impossible to us. It also helps us to align our desires with God's desires and seek His will in our lives.<h3>Think About It</h3><ol><li>Reflect on times in your life when you have witnessed or experienced the power of God. How did these experiences shape your understanding of His omnipotence?<li>Consider the paradoxical question about the stone that God cannot lift. What does this teach us about the nature of God and His actions?<li>How does knowing that "nothing is impossible with God" impact your prayers and expectations? How can you align your desires with His will?</ol><p>In conclusion, while God has the power to do anything He wishes, there are limitations to what He will do. His actions are guided by His holy will and are not contradictory to His purposes. Understanding the concept of God's omnipotence helps us to have a proper perspective of who He is and how He works in the world. We can have confidence that nothing is too hard for Him and that He is in control, even in situations that seem impossible to us. As we seek His will and align our desires with His, we can trust that He will make all things possible according to His glorious purposes.</section><div class=author-info><img alt="Maisha Johnson" class=author-image loading=lazy src=https://biblebasedliving.com/images/profile.png><div class=author-details><h4>Maisha Johnson</h4><p>Written by Maisha Johnson, a dedicated Christian writer known for her inspiring narratives and deep spiritual insights.

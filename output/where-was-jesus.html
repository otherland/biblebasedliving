and His body was placed in a nearby tomb. However, His spirit was elsewhere. Three days later, Jesus' body and spirit were reunited, and He rose from the dead. The Bible gives us some indications of where Jesus was during the three days between His death and resurrection.<h3>1. Paradise</h3><p>The clearest indication we have in Scripture of where Jesus was between His death and resurrection comes from His conversation with one of the thieves crucified next to Him. The believing thief asked Jesus to remember him when He came into His kingdom, and Jesus replied, "Truly I tell you, today you will be with me in paradise." So, after His death, Jesus went to the place of blessing where God is—Heaven. This is also where the believing thief went.<p><strong>Why This Matters:</strong> Understanding that Jesus went to paradise after His death helps us grasp the significance of His sacrifice and the assurance of eternal life for those who believe in Him.<p><strong>Think About It:</strong> How does the promise of being with Jesus in paradise impact your perspective on life and death?<h3>2. Proclamation to Imprisoned Spirits</h3><p>Another passage often mentioned in discussing where Jesus was between His death and resurrection is <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/1-Peter/3/1-Peter-3-18.html>1 Peter 3:18-20</a>. Some interpret this passage to mean that Jesus went to hell/Hades and proclaimed something to imprisoned spirits. These spirits could be fallen angels or people currently in hell.<p>If these spirits are fallen angels, they were likely imprisoned because of their involvement in a grievous sin before Noah's flood. Jesus' proclamation would have been a declaration of His victory over Satan and his hosts.<p>Alternatively, if the "spirits" mentioned in <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/1-Peter/3/1-Peter-3-19.html>1 Peter 3:19</a> are people currently in hell, then Peter is giving parenthetical information about something Jesus had done previously in history. Jesus had preached to the people of Noah's day through Noah, and they rejected His message.</p><iframe allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen frameborder=0 height=315 src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/R9qoqQ75ifs width=560></iframe><p><strong>Why This Matters:</strong> Contemplating Jesus' victory over Satan and His desire for all to hear the message of salvation encourages us to share the good news with others.<p><strong>Think About It:</strong> How does the thought of Jesus preaching to those who rejected Him in Noah's time impact your understanding of God's patience and desire for all to be saved?<h3>3. Ascension and Captivity</h3><p><a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Ephesians/4/Ephesians-4-8.html>Ephesians 4:8-10</a> is another passage that provides insight into what Jesus did during the three days between His death and resurrection. Quoting <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/68/Psalm-68-18.html>Psalm 68:18</a>, Paul says that when Jesus ascended on high, He took many captives or led a host of captives. Some believe this refers to Jesus gathering all the redeemed who were in paradise and taking them to their permanent dwelling in Heaven.<p>Another interpretation is that this verse simply refers to Jesus' triumphant return to Heaven after His resurrection. In His victory, Jesus defeated our spiritual enemies, including the devil, death, and the curse of sin.<p><strong>Why This Matters:</strong> Reflecting on Jesus' ascension and triumph reminds us of His power and the hope we have in Him.<p><strong>Think About It:</strong> How does the idea of being united with other believers in Heaven encourage you in your faith journey?<h3>Conclusion</h3><p>While the Bible does not provide detailed information about exactly what Jesus did during the three days between His death and resurrection, we can be certain that He went to paradise after His death and before His resurrection. Additionally, there are different interpretations regarding His proclamation to imprisoned spirits and the significance of His ascension.<p>Understanding where Jesus was during these three days helps us appreciate the fullness of His sacrifice, His victory over sin and death, and the hope we have in Him. As believers, we can look forward to being with Jesus in paradise and experiencing the ultimate victory that He has already achieved.</section><div class=author-info><img alt="Maisha Johnson" class=author-image loading=lazy src=https://biblebasedliving.com/images/profile.png><div class=author-details><h4>Maisha Johnson</h4><p>Written by Maisha Johnson, a dedicated Christian writer known for her inspiring narratives and deep spiritual insights.

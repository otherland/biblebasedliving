theology. The Bible teaches that Jesus was not created but rather is the Creator Himself. This belief in the eternality of Christ is a distinguishing characteristic of biblical Christianity.<h3>Jesus as the Creator</h3><p>According to the Bible, Jesus is not only the Son of God but also the Creator of all things. The book of Colossians states that "in [Jesus Christ] all things were created: . . . all things have been created through him and for him" (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Colossians/1/Colossians-1-16.html>Colossians 1:16</a>). This emphasizes that Jesus is not a created being but rather the one responsible for creating everything. This understanding sets orthodox Christianity apart from other religions and philosophies.<h3>Different Beliefs about Jesus' Creation</h3><p>While Jesus is highly respected in various religious beliefs such as Islam, Mormonism, and Jehovah’s Witnesses, these groups teach that Jesus was a created being. For example, Muslims view Jesus as a virgin-born human prophet who came into existence just like any other person. Mormons, influenced by Arianism, believe that Jesus had a beginning similar to God the Father. Jehovah’s Witnesses assert that Jesus was the first creation of Jehovah and was originally known as Michael the archangel.<h3>What Did Early Creeds Teach?</h3><p>The early creeds of the church firmly affirm that Jesus was not created but is an eternally divine Person, the Son of God. These creeds provide essential guidance for understanding the nature of Jesus. They clarify whether Jesus belongs to the created order or if He, along with the Father and the Holy Spirit, is the Creator of all things. The Council of Nicea declared that Christ and the Father are "of the same substance," countering Arius' belief that Christ was "of a different substance."</p><iframe allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen frameborder=0 height=315 src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/WY-b9fr-8d8 width=560></iframe><h3>Jesus' Claim to Divinity</h3><p>To understand whether Jesus was created or not, it is crucial to examine His own words. During His ministry, Jesus consistently assumed divine prerogatives and exercised rights that would not be appropriate for a created being. For instance, He declared Himself as the "Lord of the Sabbath," asserting His authority over this institution established by God. Jesus also spoke of His unique knowledge of the Father and the glory He shared with the Father before the world began. Furthermore, He accepted worship from others and described a future time when He would judge all nations.<h3>The Testimony of Jesus' Disciples</h3><p>The disciples of Jesus also held a clear belief in His divinity and uncreated nature. The Gospel of John reveals that Jesus is the eternal Word who was with God and was God from the very beginning. After encountering the risen Jesus, the apostle Thomas exclaimed, "My Lord and my God!" The apostle Paul referred to Christ as "God over all" and affirmed that in Him dwells the fullness of deity bodily. In the early days of the church, Christians prayed to Jesus and proclaimed forgiveness of sins in His name.<h3>The Incarnation: God Made Flesh</h3><p>Although Jesus is eternal and uncreated, He chose to take on human flesh at a specific point in history, known as the Incarnation. This act was essential for our salvation. The Incarnation signifies that the eternal Son, who always existed, became both truly God and truly man. However, it is important to note that there was never a time when the Son did not exist. Jesus has always been and will forever remain "our great God and Savior."<h3>Why This Matters</h3><p>Understanding whether Jesus was created or not has significant implications for our faith. If Jesus were merely a created being, He would not possess the divine authority or power to save us from our sins. However, recognizing His eternal nature affirms His role as our Savior and allows us to place our complete trust in Him. It also highlights the uniqueness of Christianity compared to other religious beliefs.<h3>Think About It</h3><p>Contemplating the eternal nature of Jesus challenges us to consider the depth of His divinity and the magnitude of His sacrifice for our salvation. Recognizing that Jesus is not created but the Creator Himself emphasizes His authority, knowledge, and power. It also encourages us to approach Him with reverence and worship, recognizing Him as the one who holds all things together and is worthy of our devotion.<p>In conclusion, according to the Bible and orthodox Christianity, Jesus was not created but is the eternal Son of God and the Creator of all things. His divine nature, demonstrated through His words and actions, sets Him apart from any created being. Understanding Jesus' eternal nature is crucial for our faith and enables us to fully trust in Him as our Savior.</section><div class=author-info><img alt="Maisha Johnson" class=author-image loading=lazy src=https://biblebasedliving.com/images/profile.png><div class=author-details><h4>Maisha Johnson</h4><p>Written by Maisha Johnson, a dedicated Christian writer known for her inspiring narratives and deep spiritual insights.

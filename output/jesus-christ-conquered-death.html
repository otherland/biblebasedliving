through His resurrection. This sets Christianity apart from all other religions. While other religious leaders may have made predictions about their own deaths and resurrections, only Jesus fulfilled these prophecies (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/16/Matthew-16-21.html>Matthew 16:21</a>). His resurrection was a unique event in history, as no one else who was resurrected before Him remained alive permanently. Jesus' resurrection was a complete and definitive defeat of death itself (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/1-Corinthians/15/1-Corinthians-15-54.html>1 Corinthians 15:54</a>–55).<h3>The Resurrection of Jesus</h3><p>The most significant aspect of Jesus conquering death is His resurrection. Jesus, who was once dead, is now alive (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Revelation/1/Revelation-1-18.html>Revelation 1:18</a>). This miraculous event marked the first time in history that someone rose from the dead and did not die again. It is a testament to His power over death and His divine authority. Jesus Himself declared, "I am the Living One; I was dead, and now look, I am alive for ever and ever! And I hold the keys of death and Hades" (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Revelation/1/Revelation-1-18.html>Revelation 1:18</a>). As the sovereign ruler over death, Jesus' conquest of death is permanent and eternal.<h3>The Sinlessness of Jesus</h3><p>Another reason why Jesus conquered death is because He was sinless. In the Garden of Eden, sin brought about a curse upon mankind, resulting in death (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/2/Genesis-2-17.html>Genesis 2:17</a>). <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/6/Romans-6-23.html>Romans 6:23</a> states that "the wages of sin is death." However, Jesus was without sin (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/1-Peter/2/1-Peter-2-22.html>1 Peter 2:22</a>), and therefore, death had no power over Him. His voluntary sacrifice on the cross for our sins made His resurrection a logical outcome. As Jesus said, "I lay down my life only to take it up again" (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/John/10/John-10-17.html>John 10:17</a>).<h3>The Gospel and Eternal Consequences</h3><iframe allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen frameborder=0 height=315 src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/F2ZSZ0ZXLGs width=560></iframe><p>The fact that Jesus conquered death has significant eternal consequences for believers. The gospel, which is the good news, is grounded in Christ's victory over death. Without His resurrection, there would be no hope for salvation. As the apostle Paul wrote, "If Christ has not been raised, your faith is futile; you are still in your sins" (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/1-Corinthians/15/1-Corinthians-15-17.html>1 Corinthians 15:17</a>). However, because Christ is risen, believers have passed from death to life (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/1-John/3/1-John-3-14.html>1 John 3:14</a>). Through the gospel, Jesus has destroyed death and brought life and immortality to light (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/2-Timothy/1/2-Timothy-1-10.html>2 Timothy 1:10</a>).<h3>Victory Over Death for Believers</h3><p>Christ's victory over death also extends to believers. In <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/8/Romans-8-37.html>Romans 8:37</a>, it is stated that believers are "more than conquerors through him who loved us." Jesus is described as the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/1-Corinthians/15/1-Corinthians-15-20.html>1 Corinthians 15:20</a>). This means that just as Jesus was resurrected, believers who have died will also be raised to new life. Jesus Himself assured His followers, "Because I live, you also will live" (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/John/14/John-14-19.html>John 14:19</a>).<h3>Prophecy Fulfilled</h3><p>The fact that Jesus conquered death is a fulfillment of numerous prophecies in the Old Testament. For example, the psalmist predicted that the Messiah would not be abandoned to the realm of the dead and would not see decay (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/16/Psalm-16-10.html>Psalm 16:10</a>). Other prophets also spoke of God delivering His people from the power of the grave and abolishing death (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/25/Isaiah-25-8.html>Isaiah 25:8</a>; <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Hosea/13/Hosea-13-14.html>Hosea 13:14</a>; <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/1-Corinthians/15/1-Corinthians-15-54.html>1 Corinthians 15:54</a>–55).<h3>Defeating Satan and Sin</h3><p>Death is a powerful weapon that Satan uses against humanity. However, through His death on the cross, Jesus defeated Satan and his power over death (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/John/12/John-12-31.html>John 12:31</a>; <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Colossians/2/Colossians-2-15.html>Colossians 2:15</a>). With His resurrection, Jesus destroyed the devil's most potent weapon. Satan, the accuser, is now powerless to condemn Christians. Believers will not share in his fate (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Revelation/12/Revelation-12-9.html>Revelation 12:9</a>–11; 20:10, 14).<h3>Why This Matters</h3><p>The fact that Jesus Christ conquered death has profound implications for our lives as Christians. It means that we no longer have to fear death because Jesus has triumphed over it. We can have confidence in our eternal destiny, knowing that through faith in Him, we have passed from death to life. Our hope is not in this world but in the resurrection to come.<h3>Think About It</h3><p>Reflecting on the victory of Jesus over death should lead us to gratitude and worship. It reminds us of the incredible love and sacrifice of Christ and the power of God to overcome even death itself. As believers, we can find comfort and assurance in knowing that Jesus has conquered death on our behalf. It also challenges us to live in light of this victory, boldly proclaiming the gospel and living out our faith with confidence and hope.</section><div class=author-info><img alt="Maisha Johnson" class=author-image loading=lazy src=https://biblebasedliving.com/images/profile.png><div class=author-details><h4>Maisha Johnson</h4><p>Written by Maisha Johnson, a dedicated Christian writer known for her inspiring narratives and deep spiritual insights.

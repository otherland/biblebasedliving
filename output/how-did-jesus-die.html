It represents His ultimate sacrifice for the sins of humanity and is the foundation of Christianity. But what exactly led to Jesus' death? What were the physical factors that contributed to His crucifixion? In this article, we will explore the details surrounding Jesus' death, examining the biblical accounts and medical perspectives.<h3>The Agony in the Garden</h3><p>After the Last Supper, Jesus went to pray in the Garden of Gethsemane. He was fully aware of the physical trauma He was about to endure. In <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/26/Matthew-26-39.html>Matthew 26:39</a>, Jesus prayed, "My Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me; nevertheless, not as I will, but as you will." Despite knowing the agony that awaited Him, Jesus submitted to the Father's will.<p>During His intense prayer, Luke describes a rare medical condition known as hematidrosis. This condition occurs when extreme stress causes blood vessels in the sweat glands to rupture. Luke writes that "His sweat became like great drops of blood falling down to the ground" (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/22/Luke-22-44.html>Luke 22:44</a>).<h3>The Trials and Beatings</h3><p>After His arrest in the garden, Jesus was taken before a Jewish court where He was found guilty of blasphemy. The guards then beat Him (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/14/Mark-14-65.html>Mark 14:65</a>). Early in the morning, Jesus was brought before Pilate, the Roman governor of the province (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/15/Mark-15-1.html>Mark 15:1</a>). Pilate found no fault in Jesus and attempted to release Him but succumbed to pressure from the crowd.<p>Pilate had Jesus scourged before handing Him over to be crucified. Scourging was a severe form of flogging reserved for those condemned to death. Roman soldiers used a flagrum, a short whip with leather thongs attached to fragments of metal, bone, or lead. Each strike embedded the sharp fragments into the skin, tearing away chunks of flesh. This brutal punishment caused immense pain, shock, and blood loss.<h3>The Journey to Golgotha</h3><p>After the scourging, Jesus was forced to carry His cross to the place of execution. Already weakened from the beatings and lack of sleep, Jesus collapsed multiple times under the weight. Simon of Cyrene was then pressed into service to help carry the cross (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/15/Mark-15-21.html>Mark 15:21</a>).<p>Upon reaching Golgotha, Jesus was stripped of His clothing and laid on the ground with the crossbeam beneath His shoulders. Large iron nails, approximately 5 to 7 inches long, were driven through His wrists. These nails were placed at the point where the wrist meets the hand, between the radius and ulna bones. This location supported the weight of the body without tearing through the flesh.</p><iframe allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen frameborder=0 height=315 src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/U_rzCrR4JJo width=560></iframe><p>The soldiers then lifted and fixed the crossbeam to an upright post called the stipe already positioned in the ground. Jesus' feet were nailed to the stipe by placing one foot over the other and driving a single large nail through both feet into the wood. This position required Jesus to push up on the nail in order to breathe, causing excruciating pain with every breath.<h3>The Physical Agonies</h3><p>The combination of shock, blood loss, and inability to breathe caused a slow and agonizing death. The factors contributing to Jesus' death could have included asphyxiation, heart failure, and hypovolemic shock. Asphyxiation occurs when a person is unable to get enough oxygen due to their position or physical condition. Hanging on the cross with outstretched arms made breathing difficult for Jesus.<p>Furthermore, crucifixion put immense strain on the heart. As Jesus hung on the cross, His heart had to work harder to pump blood against gravity. This increased workload could have led to heart failure.<p>Additionally, Jesus experienced hypovolemic shock due to the extreme blood loss from the scourging and crucifixion. This shock occurs when there is a significant loss of blood or fluid, leading to a drop in blood pressure and inadequate organ perfusion. The combination of these physical agonies would have caused immense suffering.<h3>Jesus' Final Moments</h3><p>After enduring unimaginable torment for approximately six hours, Jesus cried out with a loud voice, "Father, into your hands I commit my spirit" (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/23/Luke-23-46.html>Luke 23:46</a>). With these words, He breathed His last breath. As Jesus had earlier taught, "No one takes [My life] from me, but I lay it down of my own accord" (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/John/10/John-10-18.html>John 10:18</a>).<p>Following His death, a soldier pierced Jesus' side with a spear to confirm His death. "A sudden flow of blood and water" gushed from His body (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/John/19/John-19-34.html>John 19:34</a>), indicating that Jesus had indeed died from the trauma inflicted upon Him.<h3>Why This Matters</h3><p>Understanding the details of Jesus' crucifixion helps us grasp the gravity of His sacrifice. It reminds us of the immense love and obedience Jesus demonstrated by willingly enduring such physical torment for our sake. Jesus' death on the cross provides the opportunity for salvation and reconciliation with God.<h3>Think About It</h3><p>Take a moment to reflect on what Jesus endured during His crucifixion. Consider the physical agony He experienced and the profound love He displayed through His sacrifice. How does this deepen your understanding of God's love for you? How can you respond to this sacrificial love in your own life?<p>Note: This article was adapted from "On the Physical Death of Jesus Christ" by William D. Edwards, W. J. Gabel, and F. E.

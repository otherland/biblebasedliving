actually found in the Bible. It is commonly attributed to Benjamin Franklin, who mentioned it in 1757. However, the saying can be traced back even further to Algernon Sydney in 1698. While this phrase has gained popularity, it is important to note that it does not align with the teachings of the Bible.<p>Contrary to the popular saying, the Bible teaches that God helps the helpless. <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/25/Isaiah-25-4.html>Isaiah 25:4</a> describes God as a defense for the helpless and a refuge from distress. <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/5/Romans-5-6.html>Romans 5:6</a> states that Christ died for the ungodly while they were still helpless. These verses highlight how God extends His help to those who are unable to help themselves.<p>In terms of salvation, we are all completely helpless. The Bible tells us that all have sinned and fallen short of God's glory (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/3/Romans-3-23.html>Romans 3:23</a>), and as a result, we face condemnation (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/6/Romans-6-23.html>Romans 6:23</a>). There is nothing we can do on our own to remedy this situation (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/64/Isaiah-64-6.html>Isaiah 64:6</a>). However, there is good news. God, in His mercy and love, offers His help to us. While we were still sinners, Jesus died for us (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/5/Romans-5-8.html>Romans 5:8</a>). Jesus paid the penalty for our sins that we were incapable of paying (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/2-Corinthians/5/2-Corinthians-5-21.html>2 Corinthians 5:21</a>). It is through God's provision and grace that we are saved because we cannot save ourselves.<h3>The Importance of Taking Action</h3><iframe allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen frameborder=0 height=315 src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/qK9zrW-vh-k width=560></iframe><p>While the concept of "God helps those who help themselves" may not align with salvation, there is a sense in which it holds some truth. Let's consider an example - if you asked someone to help you move a piece of furniture but simply watched as they did all the work, would you truly be helping? In this scenario, you would not be actively participating in the task at hand. Many Christians fall into the trap of inactivity when it comes to seeking God's help. They ask for His assistance but expect Him to do everything on their behalf. While it is true that God provides according to His will and timing, it does not mean we should be inactive.<p>For instance, if you are in need of a job, it is appropriate to ask the Lord for help but also take action by actively searching for employment. God expects us to be diligent in our efforts and seek His guidance as we make decisions. It is highly unlikely that God will cause employers to come looking for us without any effort on our part.<h3>Why This Matters</h3><p>Understanding the truth about how God helps the helpless is crucial for our faith and relationship with Him. Recognizing that we are powerless to save ourselves and relying on God's grace fosters humility and gratitude in our hearts. It reminds us that our salvation is not earned through our own efforts but is a gift freely given by God.<p>Additionally, realizing the importance of taking action and being diligent in seeking God's help encourages us to actively participate in our own lives. We are called to be obedient and faithful stewards of the opportunities and resources God has provided. Instead of passively waiting for things to happen, we should actively engage with the world around us, trusting that God will guide and empower us.<h3>Think About It</h3><ol><li><p>Reflect on your own life. Have you ever fallen into the trap of inactivity, expecting God to do everything without taking any action yourself? How can you strike a balance between relying on God's help and being proactive in your endeavors?</p><li><p>Consider how understanding the truth about God helping the helpless impacts your perspective on salvation. How does recognizing your own helplessness and dependence on God's grace shape your relationship with Him?</p><li><p>What are some practical steps you can take to actively seek God's help in specific areas of your life? How can you demonstrate diligence and faithfulness while relying on His guidance and provision?</p></ol><p>As Christians, let us embrace the truth that God helps the helpless. May we humbly depend on His grace for our salvation and actively participate in the work He has called us to do.</section><div class=author-info><img alt="Maisha Johnson" class=author-image loading=lazy src=https://biblebasedliving.com/images/profile.png><div class=author-details><h4>Maisha Johnson</h4><p>Written by Maisha Johnson, a dedicated Christian writer known for her inspiring narratives and deep spiritual insights.

However, the Bible tells us that God is a spirit and His appearance is beyond our ability to comprehend or describe. In <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/John/4/John-4-24.html>John 4:24</a>, it says, "God is spirit, and his worshipers must worship in the Spirit and in truth." This means that God is not bound by physical form or limitations.<p>In <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Exodus/33/Exodus-33-20.html>Exodus 33:20</a>, we are told, "You cannot see my face, for no one may see me and live." This verse highlights the fact that as sinful human beings, we are incapable of fully perceiving and understanding the glory of God's appearance. His divine presence is too magnificent and overwhelming for us to safely experience in our fallen state.<p>It's important to note that when the Bible describes instances of God appearing to people, it should not be understood as an exact depiction of what He looks like. Instead, these descriptions serve as revelations of God's character and attributes in a way that we can comprehend. The purpose is to teach us truths about Him rather than to provide a visual image for us to hold onto.<h3>Ezekiel's Vision</h3><p>One powerful description of God's appearance is found in <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Ezekiel/1/Ezekiel-1-26.html>Ezekiel 1:26-28</a>. Ezekiel writes, "Above the expanse over their heads was what looked like a throne of sapphire, and high above on the throne was a figure like that of a man. I saw that from what appeared to be his waist up he looked like glowing metal, as if full of fire, and that from there down he looked like fire; and brilliant light surrounded him. Like the appearance of a rainbow in the clouds on a rainy day, so was the radiance around him."<p>In this vision, Ezekiel saw what appeared to be a throne made of sapphire with a figure resembling a man seated on it. The upper part of the figure seemed to be made of glowing metal, while the lower part appeared as fire. The radiance surrounding God was described as being like a rainbow on a rainy day. It's important to remember that these descriptions are symbolic and not meant to be taken literally. They represent Ezekiel's best attempt at conveying the awe-inspiring presence of God.</p><iframe allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen frameborder=0 height=315 src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/QPywCD-TSd0 width=560></iframe><h3>John's Revelation</h3><p>Another vivid portrayal of God's appearance is found in the book of Revelation. In <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Revelation/1/Revelation-1-14.html>Revelation 1:14-16</a>, John describes his vision by saying, "His head and hair were white like wool, as white as snow, and his eyes were like blazing fire. His feet were like bronze glowing in a furnace, and his voice was like the sound of rushing waters. In his right hand he held seven stars, and out of his mouth came a sharp double-edged sword. His face was like the sun shining in all its brilliance."<p>In this vision, John sees Jesus in all His glory. His white hair symbolizes wisdom and purity, while His blazing eyes represent His penetrating gaze and all-seeing knowledge. The bronze feet glowing in a furnace indicate strength and stability. The voice like rushing waters signifies authority and power. The seven stars held in His hand could represent the angels or messengers of the seven churches addressed in Revelation. Finally, the sharp double-edged sword coming out of His mouth represents the Word of God, which is powerful and able to judge.<h3>Understanding Symbolism</h3><p>Both Ezekiel's and John's visions use symbolic language to describe what is beyond human comprehension. They had to rely on familiar images and metaphors to convey their experiences. It's important to approach these descriptions with an understanding that they are meant to communicate deep spiritual truths rather than provide an exact depiction of God's physical appearance.<p>Throughout the Bible, we find various instances where God reveals Himself in ways that humans can understand. These revelations are tailored to our limited capacity, allowing us to catch glimpses of His character and attributes. As finite beings, we cannot fully fathom or visualize the infinite and transcendent nature of God.<h3>Why This Matters</h3><p>The question of what God looks like is significant because it touches on our desire to know and connect with Him on a deeper level. However, it's crucial to recognize the limitations of our human understanding. God reveals Himself to us in ways that we can comprehend, but His true essence remains beyond our grasp.<p>Understanding that God's appearance is beyond our ability to perceive helps us approach Him with humility and reverence. It reminds us that we are finite creatures and He is the infinite Creator. Rather than seeking to form a specific image of God in our minds, we should focus on developing a deeper relationship with Him through faith, prayer, and studying His Word.<h3>Think About It</h3><ol><li>How does the concept of God's appearance challenge our human tendency to create idols or images of Him?<li>In what ways can recognizing the limitations of our understanding deepen our awe and reverence for God?<li>How does the symbolic language used to describe God's appearance help us relate to His character and attributes?<li>How can we cultivate a deeper relationship with God without relying on physical depictions or visual representations?</ol></section><div class=author-info><img alt="Maisha Johnson" class=author-image loading=lazy src=https://biblebasedliving.com/images/profile.png><div class=author-details><h4>Maisha Johnson</h4><p>Written by Maisha Johnson, a dedicated Christian writer known for her inspiring narratives and deep spiritual insights.

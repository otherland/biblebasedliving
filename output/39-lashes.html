Jesus</h2><p>The crucifixion of Jesus Christ is a pivotal event in Christian theology, but it is often easy to overlook the excruciating torment that He endured before being nailed to the cross. Just before His crucifixion, Jesus was scourged by the Romans (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/John/19/John-19-1.html>John 19:1</a>). The Bible does not directly indicate how many lashes Jesus received. However, we can gain some insight into this by examining Jewish customs and practices during that time.<p>According to <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Deuteronomy/25/Deuteronomy-25-3.html>Deuteronomy 25:3</a>, a criminal should not receive more than forty lashes. In order to avoid possibly accidentally breaking this command, the Jews would only give a criminal 39 lashes. The Apostle Paul mentioned this practice in <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/2-Corinthians/11/2-Corinthians-11-24.html>2 Corinthians 11:24</a>, stating, "five times I received from the Jews the forty lashes minus one." However, it is important to note that Jesus was scourged by the Romans, not by the Jews. Therefore, it is unlikely that the Romans would have followed this specific Jewish tradition.<p>Scourging was a punishment ordered for Jesus by Pontius Pilate. He was to be flogged (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/27/Matthew-27-26.html>Matthew 27:26</a>) but not killed in that way. His death was to be carried out by crucifixion after the scourging. The level of hatred and cruelty necessary to subject an innocent man to such a fate is unimaginable. Yet, both the Jewish leaders and Pilate conspired to have Jesus flogged and crucified, despite knowing His innocence. What makes this even more profound is the fact that the man they sent to be tormented and crucified was none other than the Son of God Himself.<p>The prophet Isaiah prophesied about the suffering that Jesus would endure, saying, "He was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed" (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/53/Isaiah-53-5.html>Isaiah 53:5</a>). The "stripes" referred to in this prophecy are a direct reference to the lashes Jesus received during His scourging. This prophecy highlights the incredible sacrifice that Jesus made for humanity. His suffering and the wounds He bore on our behalf were not in vain but served to bring spiritual healing to all who would believe.<h3>Why This Matters</h3><p>Understanding the extent of the physical punishment that Jesus endured helps us grasp the depth of His love for us. He willingly chose to accept an undeserved, cruel death in order to save His sheepâ€”the people He came to redeem. Additionally, recognizing the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies in Jesus' suffering and death strengthens our faith and confidence in the divine plan of salvation.<h3>Think About It</h3><p>Take a moment to reflect on the magnitude of Jesus' sacrifice. Consider the physical pain and emotional anguish He endured for your sake. How does this knowledge impact your understanding of God's love for you? How does it inspire you to live a life that honors and reflects His sacrifice?<h2>The Terrible Ordeal of Scourging</h2><p>Whether there were 39 lashes or 40 or some other number, the scourging that Jesus experienced was undoubtedly a terrible and painful ordeal. Scourging was a common form of punishment in Roman times, involving the use of a whip called a flagrum or a flagellum. The whip consisted of multiple leather thongs embedded with pieces of bone or metal, designed to cause maximum pain and damage.<p>The executioner would typically tie the victim's hands to a post or pillar, leaving their back exposed and vulnerable. The scourger would then strike the victim repeatedly with full force, lacerating their flesh and causing severe pain. The goal was not only to inflict physical suffering but also to humiliate and dehumanize the condemned person.<p>The physical effects of scourging were devastating. The whip's sharp edges would tear through the skin, exposing underlying muscle and tissue. Blood loss, bruising, and swelling would occur, leading to extreme pain and trauma. In some cases, victims would even die from the scourging alone due to the severity of their injuries.<p>In Jesus' case, the scourging was carried out by Roman soldiers under the orders of Pontius Pilate. These soldiers were known for their brutality and lack of mercy. They would have subjected Jesus to a merciless flogging, aiming to break His spirit and weaken Him physically before His crucifixion.</p><iframe allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen frameborder=0 height=315 src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/m_FnL7mKhFg width=560></iframe><h2>The Spiritual Significance</h2><p>The torment that Jesus endured during His scourging was not just a physical ordeal; it held profound spiritual significance as well. Isaiah compared humanity to a flock of sheep that had turned away from its Shepherd, with each individual going their own wayâ€”a picture of disharmony and danger (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/53/Isaiah-53-6.html>Isaiah 53:6</a>). But God, in His infinite love and mercy, chose to lay on Jesus the iniquity of us all.<p>Jesus, the pure and innocent Son of God, willingly bore our sins and their consequences upon His own body. Through His wounds and suffering, He took upon Himself the punishment that we deserved. Just as Isaiah prophesied, "the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed" (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/53/Isaiah-53-5.html>Isaiah 53:5</a>).<p>By His sacrificial death on the cross, Jesus provided a way for us to be reconciled with God and experience spiritual healing. His wounds serve as a powerful reminder of the seriousness of our sin and the depth of His love for us. Through faith in Jesus' sacrifice, we can receive forgiveness and salvation.<h3>Why This Matters</h3><p>Recognizing the spiritual significance of Jesus' scourging enables us to grasp the magnitude of His sacrifice. It highlights the depth of God's love for us and the incredible lengths He went to in order to redeem humanity. This knowledge calls us to respond with gratitude, repentance, and a desire to live in a manner that honors and reflects the sacrifice of Christ.<h3>Think About It</h3><p>Consider the wounds that Jesus bore for your sake. Reflect on the spiritual healing and restoration that is available through His sacrifice. How does this knowledge impact your perspective on sin and forgiveness? How does it inspire you to live a life of gratitude and obedience to God?<h2>The Good Shepherd's Sacrifice</h2><p>The scourging of Jesus serves as a profound illustration of His role as the Good Shepherd. In <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/John/10/John-10-11.html>John 10:11</a>, Jesus Himself said, "I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep." This statement not only reveals Jesus' willingness to sacrifice Himself for humanity but also emphasizes His deep love and concern for His followers.<p>Jesus, as the Good Shepherd, knows His sheep intimately. He knows each one individually, just as the Father knows Him and He knows the Father (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/John/10/John-10-15.html>John 10:15</a>). This intimate knowledge and connection form the basis for His sacrificial act of laying down His life for His sheep.<p>Jesus' death was not a tragic accident or an act forced upon Him by others. He said, "No one takes it from me, but I lay it down of my own accord. I have authority to lay it down, and I have authority to take it up again" (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/John/10/John-10-18.html>John 10:18</a>). His sacrifice was a deliberate choice motivated by love and obedience to the Father's plan.<p>As the Good Shepherd, Jesus willingly took upon Himself the punishment that we deserved. He bore the weight of our sins, offering Himself as the ultimate sacrifice to save us from eternal separation from God. Through His death and resurrection, Jesus conquered sin and death, providing eternal life for all who believe in Him.<h2>Why This Matters</h2><p>Understanding Jesus' role as the Good Shepherd who willingly laid down His life for His sheep deepens our appreciation for His sacrifice. It reminds us of the personal nature of God's love and the lengths He went to in order to save us. This knowledge calls us to respond with faith, trust, and obedience to the One who gave everything for our sake.<h2>Think About It</h2><p>Reflect on the love and care that Jesus, the Good Shepherd, has shown you by laying down His life. Consider how His sacrifice has impacted your life and your relationship with God. How does this knowledge inspire you to follow Him and live as one of His sheep?</section><div class=author-info><img alt="Maisha Johnson" class=author-image loading=lazy src=https://biblebasedliving.com/images/profile.png><div class=author-details><h4>Maisha Johnson</h4><p>Written by Maisha Johnson, a dedicated Christian writer known for her inspiring narratives and deep spiritual insights.

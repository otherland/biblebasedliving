This title signifies the close relationship between God and His children. As followers of Christ, we are called children of God. The apostle John writes in <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/1-John/3/1-John-3-1.html>1 John 3:1</a>, “See what great love the Father has lavished on us, that we should be called children of God! And that is what we are! The reason the world does not know us is that it did not know Him.” In this passage, John wants us to observe and appreciate the incredible love that the Father has bestowed upon us.<h3>God's Lavish Love</h3><p>The term "lavished" used by John implies an action and the extent of God's love. It expresses astonishment and admiration at the abundant love that the Father pours out on His children. It's important to note that God's fatherhood is eternal; He has always been the Father of Jesus Christ, and through Jesus, He becomes our Father. Through our faith in Jesus Christ, we receive the Father's love and are adopted into His family, becoming children of God.<p>As children of God, we have the privilege of being heirs and co-heirs with Christ (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/8/Romans-8-17.html>Romans 8:17</a>). We share in the inheritance of all that God has promised. This is not a promise for some future time; it is a present reality. We are already God's children, enjoying all the rights and privileges that come with our adoption. Our status as His children allows us to experience His love, provision, and protection.<h3>Knowing God as Our Father</h3><iframe allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen frameborder=0 height=315 src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/tyYsGH0oPbg width=560></iframe><p>To be called children of God means that we have an experiential knowledge of Him as our Father. We have a personal relationship with Him. Just as earthly fathers love, provide for, and protect their children, our heavenly Father does the same for us. He disciplines us when necessary for our benefit, that we may grow in holiness and be transformed into His likeness.<p>As children of God, we are described in various ways in Scripture. We are heirs of God and co-heirs with Christ, sharing in the inheritance of eternal life (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/8/Romans-8-17.html>Romans 8:17</a>). We are holy priests, set apart to serve God and represent Him to the world (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/1-Peter/2/1-Peter-2-5.html>1 Peter 2:5</a>). We are new creations, transformed by the power of the Holy Spirit (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/2-Corinthians/5/2-Corinthians-5-17.html>2 Corinthians 5:17</a>). And we are partakers of the divine nature, having been given new life through our union with Christ (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/2-Peter/1/2-Peter-1-4.html>2 Peter 1:4</a>).<h3>Why This Matters</h3><p>Understanding and embracing our identity as children of God is crucial for our faith journey. It reminds us of the depth of God's love for us and the privilege we have as His beloved children. It also helps us to have confidence in approaching God, knowing that He is our loving Father who desires a close relationship with us. Recognizing ourselves as children of God also shapes how we view ourselves and others, treating them with love, compassion, and respect.<h3>Think About It</h3><ol><li>Reflect on the love that the Father has lavished on you as His child. How does this reality impact your daily life?<li>Consider the significance of being called a child of God. How does it change your perspective on your purpose and worth?<li>How does knowing God as your heavenly Father shape your relationship with Him? How does it influence the way you relate to other believers?</ol><p>As we meditate on the truth that we are children of God, let us embrace our identity and live in the fullness of His love and grace. May we grow in our understanding of what it means to be called His children and walk in the knowledge that He is our heavenly Father who loves us unconditionally.</section><div class=author-info><img alt="Maisha Johnson" class=author-image loading=lazy src=https://biblebasedliving.com/images/profile.png><div class=author-details><h4>Maisha Johnson</h4><p>Written by Maisha Johnson, a dedicated Christian writer known for her inspiring narratives and deep spiritual insights.

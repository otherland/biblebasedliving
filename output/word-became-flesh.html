There are two Greek words translated as "word": rhema and logos. Rhema typically means "a spoken word," while logos has a broader, more philosophical meaning. In the context of John 1, where the phrase "Word became flesh" is found, the word used is logos.<p>Logos implies a total message and is often used to refer to God's message to mankind. For example, when Jesus taught the people, they were amazed not just by the specific words He chose but by His total message (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/4/Luke-4-32.html>Luke 4:32</a>). In John 1, "The Word" refers to Jesus Christ, who is the embodiment of everything that God wants to communicate to humanity.<p>The first chapter of John provides insight into the relationship between the Father and Son before Jesus came to earth in human form. It reveals that Jesus preexisted with the Father, was involved in the creation of everything, and is the "light of all mankind" (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/John/1/John-1-1.html>John 1:1-4</a>).<p>God the Father is Spirit and invisible to the human eye. Throughout history, God had spoken messages of love and redemption through prophets, but these messages often went unheeded (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Ezekiel/22/Ezekiel-22-26.html>Ezekiel 22:26</a>; <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/23/Matthew-23-37.html>Matthew 23:37</a>). People found it easy to disregard the message of an invisible God and continued to live in sin and rebellion. Therefore, God's message took on human form and became flesh in Jesus Christ (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/1/Matthew-1-23.html>Matthew 1:23</a>; <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/8/Romans-8-3.html>Romans 8:3</a>; <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Philippians/2/Philippians-2-5.html>Philippians 2:5</a>–11).</p><iframe allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen frameborder=0 height=315 src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/dzwWz4uOwrM width=560></iframe><h3>The Greek Concept of Logos</h3><p>The Greeks used the term logos to refer to one's "mind," "reason," or "wisdom." John utilized this Greek concept to communicate that Jesus, as the Second Person of the Trinity, is the self-expression of God to the world. In the Old Testament, the word of God brought the universe into existence and saved those in need (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/33/Psalm-33-6.html>Psalm 33:6</a>; 107:20). In his Gospel, John appeals to both Jews and Gentiles to receive the eternal Christ.<h3>The Parable of the Vineyard</h3><p>To further explain why the Word had to become flesh, Jesus told a parable in <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/20/Luke-20-9.html>Luke 20:9</a>–16. The parable involves a man who planted a vineyard and rented it to some farmers. When it was time for harvest, he sent servants to collect some of the fruit, but they were beaten and sent away empty-handed. The man then decided to send his son, thinking that the tenants would respect him. However, when the tenants saw the son, they conspired to kill him, hoping to inherit the vineyard.<p>Through this parable, Jesus reminded the Jewish leaders that they had rejected the prophets and were now rejecting Him, the Son. As a result, the Word of God, Jesus Christ, would now be offered to everyone, not just the Jews (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/John/10/John-10-16.html>John 10:16</a>; <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Galatians/2/Galatians-2-28.html>Galatians 2:28</a>; <a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Colossians/3/Colossians-3-11.html>Colossians 3:11</a>). Because the Word became flesh, believers have a high priest in Jesus who can empathize with their weaknesses since He was tempted in every way yet remained sinless (<a href=https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/4/Hebrews-4-15.html>Hebrews 4:15</a>).<h3>Why This Matters</h3><p>Understanding that Jesus is the Word made flesh is crucial for Christians. It reveals that Jesus is not merely a great teacher or prophet but is God Himself incarnate. In Him, we see the fullness of God's message and love for humanity. Through His life, death, and resurrection, Jesus offers salvation and redemption to all who believe in Him.<p>Recognizing Jesus as the Word made flesh also helps us grasp the significance of His teachings. His words carry authority because they are not just human words but the very words of God. By studying and understanding His message, we can align our lives with God's will and experience the transformative power of His Word.<h3>Think About It</h3><p>Consider the impact of Jesus being the Word made flesh. How does this truth affect your understanding of who Jesus is and the authority of His teachings? How does it change your perspective on salvation and redemption? Take time to reflect on the profound implications of Jesus as the embodiment of God's message to humanity.</section><div class=author-info><img alt="Maisha Johnson" class=author-image loading=lazy src=https://biblebasedliving.com/images/profile.png><div class=author-details><h4>Maisha Johnson</h4><p>Written by Maisha Johnson, a dedicated Christian writer known for her inspiring narratives and deep spiritual insights.
